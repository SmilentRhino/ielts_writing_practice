Some people say that one of the most important areas for government funding should be building the economy, while others believe that education is more important. 
Which do you believe is more important?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Economy and education- both are very important parts of the development and progress of a nation and have an interrelation. But here the question arises, which one should be given more funding? In my opinion both should be enhanced side by side, because without one, the other one is hard to achieve.
Here are some points which supports that both projects go side by side. First, if the population of a country has the opportunities for educations, but the roads are unpaved, there are deficiency of electricity, lack of environmental protection and safety, unemployment, poverty, high ratio of population, and low career opportunities, life wouldn’t be easy. Currently the Pakistan is suffering from more natural disaster (e.g. flood, earth quick, and deficiency of water) and men made disaster, bomb blasting, weak dam systems, deadly electric weapons etc. and if the safety of a man is in danger, how Government should pay more attention to only on education system?
On the other hand, as the population is increasing tremendously day by day, the educational policies should be made to overcome the ration of illiteracy. Government should take some steps to make the educational system as convenient as possible. Child labor is a painful dilemma of our society and that should be banned and children should be in classrooms rather than being in factories. The poor students should be given some stipend or allowance during their academic life.  An educated nation can alter the condition of a country, to make a country more successful, there is a need to educate every single person.
Both economic progress and better education facilities are important to make a country successful. Without an educated nation, the economic condition cannot be improved. Similarly without good economic condition, there will not have good opportunities for an educated person to serve the nation appropriately. Therefore both projects should be given same importance by the Government.

Some people claim that not enough of the waste from homes is recycled. They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement.
To what extent do you think laws are needed to make people recycle more of their waste?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
The growing amount of domestic waste being produced across the world is one of the most pressing problems and a fatal threat to the environment. The household waste is disposed of in several ways.  Among them, recycling is the most eco-friendly approach to waste management. Regrettably, a tiny amount of household waste is being recycled. The parliament, therefore, should pass a law to compel the waste to be recycled.
To begin with, recycling domestic waste has enormous benefits. Recycling, at its simplest, refers to the exercise of sorting waste into category, collecting, and converting of waste items into new products. For instance, waste paper can be sent to paper mills where it is reprocessed to produce new paper once again. However, recycling can reduce a substantial amount waste that has to be disposed of. This means that there is less domestic waste to landfill or incinerate. Furthermore, it helps conserving water or other limited resources, since fewer raw materials need to be extracted and processed. So, not only does recycling protect our environment, but it also worthwhile for our economy.
To that end, the government should adopt a law so that people send their domestic waste to be recycled. The law is for separating recyclables from other solid waste. That is to say that the onus is on the landlord or management association to separate the recyclable from other solid waste. Actually, there should be a separation requirement and People who violate the separation requirement are to face financial penalties. The law, thus ensure all the recyclables to be converted into new products.
In pithy, recycling is the key tool for reducing the utilization of raw materials, fossils fuels, and many other resources. So, the government should pass a law requiring the domestic waste to be recycled.

By punishing murderers with the death penalty, society is also guilt of committing murder. Therefore, life in prison is a better punishment for murderers.
To what extend do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Murder is the most heinous crime on the earth. Every single day, somebody gets murdered. People, however, are split in their opinion when it comes to the issue of punishment. Many people consider the capital punishment as the collective guilt. They plead to amend regulations to replace death penalty with life sentence for murder. In the instance, I concur with the notion that the state also is committing murder by punishing murderer with death penalty and therefore, it should be ended.
For a start, death penalty is the most irreparable crime the states perpetuate irrationally. “To err is human” is a common adage, and in the case of capital punishment, a subtle error can cause the death of an innocent man. Besides, many a time, innocence does not conspicuous until long after the innocent people’s conviction. And as it is an irrevocable convention, it does not allow the chance for the accused persons to be proven innocent. Thus, it is an obvious violation of the most basic human rights. So, the death penalty should be abolished.
Apart from that, everyone has inviolable right to life than no one or even the state has no rights to kill anyone. It is such a right that the state even cannot execute the individuals who commit murder; punishing them with death penalty violates that right. In addition, a civilized society should not tolerate torture, even if it may have good effects. Death penalty, in fact, is an inappropriate conviction for modern civilized society to respond to even the most abominable crimes.
Summing all of the above, it seems reasonable to assert right to life is an inviolable right, and should be treated as such. As far as I am concerned, the state’s justice system is fallible, and so, there is a great risk of executing an innocent. Since death penalty is such a mistake that cannot be put right. So, capital punishment should be replaced with life sentence.

Some people say that the only reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foreign country. Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language.
Discuss both these views and give your won opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
In today’s era, multilingual is considered far more crucial than ever before. Knowing a foreign language other than his or her mother tongue has enormous benefits. In many circles, it is argued that the reason people learn a second language is just for travelling or job facilities. In contrast, others assert that there are numerous reasons for learning a foreign language. To my way of thinking, people learn a foreign language for wanting to hone cognitive abilities.
Knowing a foreign language has many advantages to the travellers or job seekers. Travellers can get a unique experience when they know a foreign dialect. Tourists who know foreign language can attain authentic experience of diverse cultures, lifestyle, and places. They can easily communicate with the local people, thereby they can ask for directions, find suitable places to stay, and most importantly, can avoid misunderstanding.
Likewise, learning foreign language may unveil a new horizon of myriad job opportunities. Foreign language can pave the way for business to be expanded into global market. That is to say that the target country’s accepted jargon or puns, standard for humour, or even subtle expression or gesture, very often, are not the same as the domestic country’s idioms or norms, they must be tailored according to target nation’s cultural norms. And knowing the language an employee can easily do that. The employers, therefore, tend recruit the employees who have multilingual competency.
Apart from pleasant travel experience and job or business scope, learning foreign language has other enormous advantages. It can open the door to music, dance, film, art, science, philosophy, and so on. In my opinion, a foreign language can enhance one’s cognitive and analytical competency.  One can hone his problem solving skills, dealing with abstract concepts when he studies a second language.
To reiterate, acquisition of foreign language has plenty of benefits. Not only does it make international travel pleasant and provide a competitive edge in career choices, but it also expands the horizon of ideas, knowledge, and experience.

Rich countries should allow jobs for skilled and knowledgeable employees who are from poor countries.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
Nowadays, more and more skilled professionals from developing countries immigrate to developed countries in the hope of better life, better job and better prospect. Some people consider the trend as positive for host countries and argue that wealthy nations should open their doors more widely to the competent and learned immigrant.  But others, on the other hand, contend that rich countries would be engulfed by the increasing wave of these immigrants. In the case, I am of the honest opinion that the
For a start, when the well-educated, skilled migrant migrates to the host country, they bring with them the human capital. It is such a cost that the host country do not need to bear that is net advantage to the nation they come to augment. That is to say, the worth of the migrant is here not actually their lifetime income but rather the cost the host country do not need to cover as they already are educated and trained without the investment of the host country. In addition, the migrant are willing to work with low salaries compared with locals. The benefit directly goes to the consumer. To give an illustration of what I mean, let’s look at the case of firms which hire the skilled migrant mostly. These firms can provide cheaper services while maintaining same quality, which by consequence benefits to the consumer.
On the flip side, there also are several drawbacks. Employers may ignore training, innovation, and productivity when they get skilled migrants who are willing to work for relatively low pay. Besides, large numbers of skilled professional can swell the ranks of the unemployed. On the top of that, the increased population may put pressure on public service. In my opinion, however, the skilled migrant phenomenon is actually brain drain. The countries that experience brain drain suffer a great loss. The investment in tertiary education is lost as the highly educated professionals leave the homeland and become an asset to the host country.
All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume that skilled migrants are the double-edge sword as they contribute as well as become burden to some extent for the host nation, but the phenomenon severely affects the country from which the highly educated individuals leave.

Some people believe that the good leaders are born, whereas others hold the opinion that the leadership qualities could be obtained during the life. Who represents the good leader qualities indeed?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Is a leader born or made? This is an age-old debate as the question “which came first: the egg or the chicken? Some people believe that a leader is born; he innately possesses the social intelligence and charisma that inspires others to make greater efforts. Yet others put forward the view that a leader is made; he builds his competencies with practice, experience and mentoring. To my way of thinking, a leader comes by his talents partly through genetics but mostly through learning behaviour.  Leaders have certain traits but these are needed conducive environment to bloom.
The proponents of “leaders are born” contend that leaders are endowed with certain traits and qualities that make them better fit to leadership. That is to say that there are certain inborn virtues, such as extroversion, dare to face challenges, conscientiousness (i.e. target-oriented, reliable), emotional stability and acumen all contribute to the foundation of leadership. A leader is naturally better in these areas while others struggle to get to the same point.
The advocates of “leaders are made”, on the other hand, argue that individuals can become leaders in a structured environment through the process of learning, mentoring, and observation. This means that skills associated with leadership can be attained by training, practice and experience over time. The doctrine is embraced by the military, is evident through its leadership training programme. In my opinion,   leadership is an art. It is a set of inherent dispositions that is perfected over time with education, practice and experience.
Taking all the above into account, it seems fully justified to assume that leaders are born with certain traits as they grow in a conducive environment enhances what they already have. While people are born with certain virtues, only through learning, observing and practicing the virtues daily beyond the hostile circumstance they can emerge as a leader.

Some people say that young people today do not make good use of their leisure time and that they spend too much time inside watching television and playing video games and that they should rather spend more time outside engaging in physical activities.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
In the modern times, the new generation is having totally different hobbies and activities as compared to past. A few years ago people liked to engage in outdoor activities, but today indoor activities like watching TV, and playing video games are more preferred, which are making them introvert and socially isolated. People, especially young generation, should be engaged in outdoor activates to maintain their physical, mental and emotion well-being.
Media has taken a wide place in the mind and heart of people – spicy and romantic drama, movies, and TV shows have diverted their attention from outdoor activates. Video games are also fun and addictive and they are stress relievers for many children. That is why children spend hours after hours playing videos game. No doubt these kind of indoor activates are a source of pleasure but it can make the person physically careless, weak and lazy. The sense of care and emotional attachment among people are becoming temporary and above all sympathy, kindness and empathetic feeling have almost disappeared from the heart of the peoples.
Physical activity is necessary for active physical, social, intellectual and emotional stability, as interaction with other people in sports enhance the quality of mutual relationships, trust, and keep the mind free from all automatic negative thoughts. Many researchers have proven that our thoughts, feeling and behavior are interconnected. If we think better, we feel better and if we feel better we do better. But a socially isolated person cannot get rid of such automatic negative thoughts which further leads to severe nervous breakdown.
The outdoor activity should be promoted through media and other sources of social media. The nation will have more energetic, strong, and active people, with the physical activity and outdoor games.

Governments should spend money on railways rather than roads.
To what extend do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Investment on communicative infrastructure is very crucial to modern economy. It streamlines other production and consumption activities in the economy.  However, people are split in their opinion when it comes to the issue of spending public money on which projects. Many economists argue that the government ought to spend money on railways rather than roads. In the case, it seems reasonable to concur with this idea.
To begin with, there is not a shred of doubt that traffic congestion is one of the country’s greatest social and economic challenges. So, the government has to curb the issue effectively. In that context, railways would be the silver bullet for reducing traffic congestion. Rail can play a prominent role in the supply chain, since it is uniquely able to transport a huge volume of goods efficiently.
Likewise, railways have a little impact on the environment compared with other transport modes, particularly roads. This is because rail is far more fuel efficient than trucks or any other vehicles. In addition to this, the infrastructure is less costly to build. So, it would be more affordable for the people. Furthermore, it would generate thousands of green jobs nationwide building the infrastructure and manufacturing trains. This means that not only do railways reduce the dependency on fossil fuels, but it also has several economic, social, and environmental benefits.
Summing all of the above, investing on rail infrastructure is much more pragmatic than on roads and highways. It is an ideal solution to economic, social, and environmental development, as the inherent efficiencies are possessed by the railway transport mode.

Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important of the country.
Discuss both these views and give your won opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
It is considered by many governments that economic development is the most crucial goal to achieve. Many experts, however, argue that we need the economy to grow, but equally we need other sorts of progress. I concur with the notion that economic progress alone is not sufficient condition for the wellbeing of the citizens.
For a start, development, at its simplest, is a social condition within a nation in which the authentic needs of its population are met by the rational practice of using natural resources and system. Development and the economic growth are inextricably intertwined. Economic progress, in fact, is a step towards development. It paves the way for providing the citizens with basic social amenities, for example healthcare and education.
The notion of development spans far and beyond the realm of economic progress.  For instance, good governance, rule of law, human rights, freedom of speech, and political atmosphere are all important for sustainable development, particularly economic progress. The empirical evidence shows that the lack of good governance and weak rule of law are a major hindrance to social and economic progress.   That is to say that corruption, without good governance or rule of law, is nurtured in every tier of government, which by consequence reins progress embezzling public money.
From what has been discussed above, it seems reasonable to assume that other types of progress are as important as economic progress for sustainable development. In fact, the economic progress has a reciprocal relationship with other sort of progress. So, economic progress cannot be achieved if there is lack of other development.

Most university graduates earn more money than less well educated people. Some people argue that this means they should pay the full cost of their education.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Unemployment is a painful dilemma of current time. We have fewer opportunities to work in a well-established company and for Government job as well. Each and every field now has higher criteria for a job regarding strong academic records and excellent qualification. No one can deny that the university degree holders have more bright future regarding professional field rather than less educated persons and I quite agree that university degree holders earn a great more money than that of without university degrees or certifications.
First, many research have been conducted on this phenomenon, which highly support the fact that university graduated get not only good opportunities for securing good jobs but also they also have good income packages as well. University education teaches problem solving skills for different contexts. It also makes them enable to learn and imply new knowledge and enhance their critical thinking by theory and practical work. They can quickly and easily adopt themselves for the new job positions and they bring many innovation. They also learn multitasking approach, and can control any situation with the similar context by applying similar techniques. All these attributes distinguish them from less educated person, and they find better job options.
Now the question arises ‘should a student pay full cost of university education?’ and the answer to the question is, it should not be in state owned universities. For example the competition among university students has increased to a higher level as the top scorers and gold medalists find prestigious jobs quickly rather than average students. There are some university degree holders who are still unemployed and waiting for the fortune to open its door for them. I believe education, be it in university level, is a fundamental right of people and the government should make sure the country is offering quality education to the most deserving candidates. If education becomes all about money, talented students would not be able to finish university education as rich kids will get admission with their father’s money. However, private universities have a different scenario as they have to support all the financial factors of a university, students in private universities should be pay.
In summary, university education is important in the long run for development of a nation. Each and every person of a country should be educated, and there is no denying that university graduates earn more money than less educated employees. Finally education is a basic need and should be free unless they are not funded privately.

Alternative and traditional forms of medicine, such as acupuncture, are becoming increasingly popular. Some people say that not only do these forms of medicine not work, they can be dangerous. While others believe that they are more effective than conventional medicine.
What is your opinion?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
In the modern time, more or less everyone is suffering from some mental or physical disturbance like body pain (e.g. neck, back, shoulders pain) and mental pain like depression, anxiety and somatic pain, let along other severe diseases. Some people use convenient medical treatment for heeling their pain while others believe that alternative forms of medicine like acupuncture, body message and relaxation therapies work more effectively for them. I believe that these alternative forms of treatments are helpful in dealing many diseases but they are never better than the convenient medicine.
According to many, acupuncture treatment was introduced in China several hundred years ago and it is very effective for many patients. It is little bit painful but an effective healing method, in which sharp needles are inserted in different parts of the body, to improve the self-healing process. Basically it deals with the musculoskeletal pain, knee pain, leukopenia, morning sickness, renal colic, and much more. Thus many would agree that this is even a better treatment system than the conventional medicine. However, where is the scientific base of such alternative treatments?
Again, there are many reasons many people believe and rely on alternative medicine. First of all, they strongly believe that unlike modern medicines such treatments do not have side effects. But believing this based on scientific ground is not possible. Would not it harm human body if needles are wrongly injected in sensitive parts of our body? According to the supporter of the alternative medicine, these kinds of treatments are less expensive and more relaxing. They believe that through such treatment their body becomes active and fit, and that’s why such healing treatment is gaining more popularity in many countries. However, if you closely observe, those types of treatments are popular in less developed country where the percentage of uneducated people is quite high. Believing in mantra and magical healing may be a thing of the past century but relying on those in this modern era is bit ludicrous.
In summary, Science based medicines have some side effects and they are known. Plenty of researches are conducted for the conventional medicine based treatment while alternative treatment are rooted as personal believe and miracles. Since proper scientific grounds are yet to be established for the alternative medicines, they are far more dangerous to rely on.

Some people believe woman’s place is in the home, while others say that idea is outdated and that all women should be given the same work opportunities as men. 
What is your opinion?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Women play a major role in our society, as being a mother, sister or a wife, and also being a scientist, political leader and roles that a man can play. Women fulfill her duties and responsibilities very expertly, but still they are considered to be weak as compared to men who are more dominating gender in our society. Somehow women have made their place in the work place but still they are being treated like a feebler. In my opinion, they should be facilitated with job opportunity and have an equal place as men have.
There are many reasons why a woman should be given the same opportunities as men which are described in this essay. First of all, no one can deny the importance of freedom, women should not be dependent on her husband for financial assistance, and she should have some economic freedom. Secondly, there are more opportunities for women to learn at work place, for having more experience regarding people and life, and more chances to groom their personality and self-esteem as well and that is why women should be given opportunities to work besides men. Thirdly, working as professionals their decision making ability will improve as they will begin to think more logically and critically. This will have a positive impact on their family and personal life. They will also be able to take right decision for the future of their children. They can also learn the value of time and money for the betterment of economic condition. A nation cannot develop when half of its population is deprived from opportunities and this is the sole reason women empowerment is so vital in today’s world.
No doubt, there are some disadvantages when women will work equally with men in work places. First children of such working mothers will be ignored; physical, emotionally and socially, to some extent. Such children can be victim of isolation, low self-esteem and feeling of rejection. No one can take place of a mother; either it is day care center, nurse or relative supervision. Household responsibilities need more time and attention for a good and healthy life circle, which somewhere unheeded in the long run of employment.
However, with the balance of time management at home and work place, everything can be settled down. Woman should make more places at business work, in the running 21st century, which will bring a positive change in the society.

In recent years, farming practice has changed to include methods such as factory farming and the use of technology to improve crops. Some people believe these developments are necessary, while others regard them as dangerous and advocate a return to more traditional farming methods.
Discuss both points of view and give your own opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
In the past, food used to be produced naturally by people, through hard work and horse drawn equipment. But now farmers and business people use advanced technological procedures in fields to manufacture food. Technology has brought a great transformation in the field of agriculture, which has enriched the farming with variety of foods but many of them are produced using methods like factory farming and genetically modified foods. Some people think that modern technology should be used to produce food in any way possible for the increase population while others disagree and support the natural way of producing foods.
On one hand, with the technological help and modern farming, the farmers do not have to work hard as much they did in the past, which is fair to some extent. Technology has made it possible to create new breed of crops and increased productivity is a blessing for the ever increasing population of the world. The modern use of transport, fertilization convenience, and factory products have made farming easy than the past. The food can be preserved, genetically modified, transported to remote location easily and these all advancements are helpful for a nation.
On the other hand, the use of technology in farming and food processing has many negative consequences. Overuse of the pesticides and other chemicals contaminate the foods and many people are unknowingly consuming toxic elements through the foods they consume.  While genetically modified and factory produced foods offer a solution to the starvation of a nation, the quality of food is being affected. The technical farming is not healthier or full of nourishing characteristic as compared to non-technical farming. Thus healthier food is a main concern for people and they suggest reverting back to the old way or producing crops and processing food.
In conclusion, the use of modern technology in farming and food producing has some negative effects but we cannot deny the fact that without increasing the food production people will starve to death in the future. The growing number of starving people worldwide and the decreasing farming land are two major facts we should focus on using technological advancement for food processing but should not use harmful chemicals for personal benefits.

Leisure is a growing industry, but people no longer entertain themselves as much as they used to because the use of modern technology has made them less creative. 
Do you agree or disagree?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
Leisure industry is among the top five industry earners in the world. A new wave of technology has taken the industry into an unprecedented dimension. However, some people contend that modern technology averts people from being entertained as before. They argue that technology has made leisure activities less creative. But, I refute their notion and argue that I am rather surprised to see the variety of leisure activities brought forth by technology.
Modern technology has unveiled a new horizon of recreational activities. In the past, people usually were confined to limited activities for example having chat with friends, watching movie in the theatre, going out for a walk, and so forth. But, today, leisure activities know no bounds, even we do not need to go out to be entertained. We can spend our leisure time doing so many things within the four walls of our apartment. That is to say, technology has brought revolutionary change in satellite culture, which in turn enables us to enjoy countless programmes on both the national and international channels. Among these amazing technologies, the Internet has changed the form of entertainment dramatically. We can chat with our relatives and friends; we can enjoy umpteen number of movies, songs, dramas, fictions, and so on; we can play numerous online games; even we can visit many historical place and museums sitting in our revolving chair. For this, perhaps, some people assume that people no longer enjoy their leisure activities as much as they did in the past.
In addition, the champion of the pre-modern era state people, nowadays, do not enjoy their leisure time, but nothing could be further than the truth. People still take pleasure in their modern leisure activities based on technology. This can be manifested from the mushroom growth of leisure centres such as amusement parks, spas, restaurants, hotels, and so forth. The overflow of tourists in the tourist spots testifies that the given statement is completely insensible.
From what has been discussed above, it could be easily stated that the given opinion makes no sense. Rather the opposite in fact. We enjoy our leisure times more than yesteryears, but the mode of entertainment is different and the modern technology provide us with enormous options for leisure activities.

Some people believe that university students are required to attend the classes. Others hold the view that going to classes should be optional for students.
What is your view? Discuss. Give reasons for your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
Universities are the places for highest level of academic education and research and they are quite important for a nation to build a generation that would lead the whole nation someday. People seem like have different opinions about the necessity and importance of attending classes by the university students. I personally believe that each and every university students should attend the classes and not attending classes is never a good option though many of us think so.
First of all, undergraduate students get enrolled in universities when they are around 18-20 years old. They are quite immature in many perspectives and if attending classes are made optional, many of them would get involved in activities that would only ruin their life.
Second, subjects offered in university level are far more complex than the previous academic subjects. That is why each department in a university has specialized teachers with depth knowledge on subject matter. They usually interact with the students during the classes and explain the intricacies of different subjects. If the students miss those classes, they have no other alternatives to really understand the topics discussed in the classes.
Not all universities have advanced facilities like recording the class, offering online lectures and arranging special sessions between teachers and students. Making classes options is never a wise decision in such universities.
Finally, universities in many countries are already facing problems with lower attendance rate, politics and students involvement in prohibited activities. If classes in such universities are made optional, these pressing issues would become more intense and uncontrollable.
In summary, classes are the place where a teacher delivers his lecture, inspires students, explain complex topics and assess the students performance. If the classes in university level are made optional, that would bring many catastrophes and uncontrollable problems that would simply ruin the main purpose of an excellent university.

The education a child receives at home from having parents who are positive role models is more important than the academic education a child receives at school.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Home is the first institution of learning for the children and is informal in its setting, rules and regulations. A child learns some basic reading or casual skills from home through classical conditioning. Although home learning and parents’ attention play an important role in shaping children’s learning skills, but without school, it is hard to polish their skills, because of organized norms and academic standards.
The school systems follow some basic principles of rewards and punishments according to the performance of a child. For example, if a child shows good performance in studies or in class behavior he is positively rewarded by teachers by positive reinforcement either by tangible things (e.g. candy or toy) or verbal appreciation (e.g. good, excellent etc.). On the other hand, if he shows tantrum or bad performance in studies he is punished by the teachers.
A child learns more in class room with the peers, through a healthy competition and also learns some appropriate behavioral acts. He learns to sit in class, take grant from teachers before entering or leaving the class, discipline, communication, time management, manners and so on. He learns to face and deal with bullying and that gives him experience how to address hostile situations. Again his anxiety of public speaking decreased as compared to those children who study at home. In this way he can overcome his behavioral issue, and can perform well in academic or non-academic activities.
The children who only attend home classes often become shy, and stubborn in front of other people. When they attend school, they cannot perform in class participation as the regular school attendees can do. Their shyness leads further towards low confidence and low self-esteem issues in their adolescence.
Although the school is more important in better academic career, but we cannot deny the importance of home learning as well. It is like a two wheel of a cycle, without one the cycle cannot be run, without home education and parents’ support only school-teaching cannot help to make a child successful in academic life.

In the advanced era of 21st century, men are becoming more lethargic than ever before and technological development is one of the main reasons for that. We are purely dependent on machines for home or office works because it gives us more convenient life style and fulfill all possible needs without even leaving our home. I believe that in the future with the development in technology, we will completely rely on machines for majority of our work loads and will have more leisure time than any past generation.
Firstly, people who work in offices or factories prefer to do less physical tasks and like to rely on computers or other machines to do their jobs. For example: computers or machinery nowadays perform so many tasks that people used to do manually. Online shopping, food home delivery, recreational stuffs on TV, payment of bills and quality time on social media, all can be done without leaving the sofa. Transport is another example of technological development, which has decreased the distance, and people use vehicles even for short distance, and avoid walking. In one sense they are making people lazy. However in another sense, this is enabling people to have more free time to spend with friends and family members.
Again, female no longer need to be spend all day to take care of their kids and doing other household duties. They rely on washing machines, vacuum cleaners, cooking range machines and these devices and that have enabled them to have more free time than past generation would ever imagine. Undoubtedly, technology will advance in the future more rapidly and we will rely on them for more works. Thus a future is waiting for us when we will have machines and robots do our tasks.
In the future with the more advancement of technology, like self-driven car and robotic systems people will engross in less physical activities and will rely on machines to do our jobs. Artificial intelligent e.g. robotic system will play a role of servants in order to serve humanity. They will take care of new born baby and old sick person, which will facilitate us to have more leisure time but intimacy, pettiness, loyalty and sympathy would reduce among us.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
It is said that travel broadens the mind. 
What can we learn by travelling to other countries? Should we first explore our own countries?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Travelling broadens our mind, enhances our knowledge and gives us unique first-hand experiences if it is done in a right way. To gain ideology of different cultures and to overcome the superstitions, travelling has no alternative. Every single day of travelling teaches us a different lesson, and we experience new things while we travel. So I quite agree that travelling to different places definitely broadens the mind.
Undoubtedly, travelling opens our mind in several ways; first of all, if it is done outside the country, the invaluable insights get developed in a person with the exposure of new ways of living, tradition, norms, regional belief, different perspectives and patriotism spirit. He also learns different languages, different expressions, posture and gesture of body language, which shows how this nation symbolizes the similar thing with different gesture. The outlook about life changes to some extent because of the absorption of different images, information and memory etc. The travellers also see the beauty of nature and feel relaxed, as it is commonly said that beauty of nature refreshes the mind. The travelers do not suffer from monotonous routine and they experience new things very frequently. Books are good source of knowledge but mostly theoretical while travelling offers practical knowledge and experiences.
Secondly, through travel a person learns about his own limitations, and realizes the new side of himself.  He keeps his eyes open before taking any step because what he feels normal may be beyond the norms there. All these things made him more flexible and accustomed to new custom and traditions.
Finally, I agree that we should first explore our home country and then explore the world. Home country offers us the most important knowledge about learning our own tradition and customs. We need to learn and explore our own country first and then go out to explore other parts of the world.
In conclusion, travelling is an excellent activity, which boarded the mind with the exposure of different social events and occurrence. One can pass his knowledge and experience to next generation to overcome the superstition regarding, nations, races, and casts and travelling makes it possible.

Advances in science and technology and other areas of society in the last 100 years have transformed the way we live as well as postponing the day we die. There is no better time to be alive than now.

Sample Answer:
Science and technology have already brought about a huge revolution in our society regarding its norm, customs, traditions, facilities, better life standard and life style. Life is totally different now than it used to be 100 years ago, with non-technological use and advancement. Now a day life has more meaning as it has provided easier and fascinating life standards, but causing some noxious situation and problems as well.
There are number of advantages science and technology brought in the society, as we have more capable, doctor, engineers, architecture, lawyer, and pilots. All deadly diseases like Cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer’s and Leukemia are curable now. Communication among people has become so convenient due to internet and advanced transportation. Currently, the science is about to bring a great revolution with the blue beam experiment, which will give our life a new direction. The life is so fascinating and luxurious, everyone should have such life with full of enjoyment. We know more about outer space and have better life expectancy than ever before. Epidemic diseases are mostly under control and the nations have better relationship than the past. Seems like this is the best era to be alive and it will not be exaggeration to say that, life in present time has better possibility and meaning than even before.
On the contrary, the science and technology have not merely brought beneficial products and outcomes rather there are many harmful consequences for this advancement as well. First of all the environment is more polluted than ever before due to the usage of machinery, and on the other hand machinery usage is harmful in its use.  Secondly, the luxurious and machinery life made the man more isolated, lazy and senseless from society. Thirdly the current social experiment like blue beam experiment will ruin the life as, the people’s religion, faith, and prayers will be directed by science, and such social experiments are under working.
In short science and technology itself not a harmful but its misuse can cause harms in the world. The present era is the blessing of technology and scientific invention and without any doubt is the best time for human to be alive.

Some people think that younger generations are becoming less and less polite. 
Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
Generation gap and complaints about a different generation are two common trends though out the human history. It is quite common that many older people cannot tolerate the changes among the young people than that of their era, while young generation think that older people are boring and have a very traditional way of life. If we compare the now-old generation with their forefathers, the same scenario would appear in front of us. Thus I do not believe that the younger generations nowadays are becoming less and less polite.
Firstly, the younger generations nowadays are becoming more dynamic with their involvement in different technologies, social activities, personal and social life. For example, it is quite common that the younger generation plays the pivot role to protest any unjust or discrimination in the society.  Thus I believe that they are far more active than our ancestors. When selecting a field of study or career, they rely on their experience and passion. If this contradicts with the parents and other older relatives’ point of view, they are often referred as stubborn and whimsical. In fact this has nothing to do with les politeness or stubbornness.
It might be true that some young people do not show as much respect as they should have been, but this small segment of a generation does not represents the whole generation.
Second, the way we hear about the complaints and the behaviours of young generations seems like bit exaggerated. Most of the older people will complain about the other kids on the neibourhood while they think that their kids are quite polite and gentle. This shows how this negative mentality has created this propaganda.
In summary, I believe that the present generation is as polite as our previous generation was. The perspective and way of life might have changed but the very true nature and quality or human are still intact in our new generation.

The incidence of crimes and atrocities committed by the youth is increasing like wildfire in most cities around the world.
What are the reasons for this? Suggest at least one solution to curb it.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
Nowadays, juvenile delinquency is spreading like wildfire in many cities across the globe. It has become one of the most dire social issue as juvenile crimes, particularly murder, has swollen in such crime redden cities as Los Angels, Chicago, Oakland, and so on. There are many factors such as, family and household relationships, peer group influence, and so forth, which are held to be to a great extent culpable for what seems to be an increase in youth crimes. In the case, healthy family practice would be the silver bullet for this problem.
For a start, family and home relationships have a pivotal role in child behavior and juvenile delinquency. The family is the authentic source of socialization for children as the family is where children learn the norms and rules for functioning in the society. The children not only learn what is right from wrong and socialization competencies, but they also test and emulate acquired behaviours to trial what kind of responses the behaviour brings forth. There are several factors of family and household relationships that may contribute to youth criminal behaviour. When a child lives in an abusive family where he is consistently psychologically or physically abused, he then tend to commence exhibiting refractory attitude towards authority that could lead to further misbehaviour and undisguised contempt towards authority as he gets older. Likewise, a child may begin displaying rebellious behaviour if he lives with a family in which he does not get adequate attention from the family members, such as parents or siblings.
However, healthy family practices can play a paramount role in curbing the issue. It goes without saying that family is the role model of every child and parents and elder siblings can motivate the children to behave positively by displaying right behaviour towards society. That is to say that parents and elder siblings should practice positive values, attitude, and norms of society in this way the children will be enable to learn proper behaviour towards society or community. Family should also teach them the importance of respecting laws of the society as well as should warn them about the consequence of breaking laws that the government has made for betterment and public safety.
In pithy, today more than ever, youth crime has become one of the most pressing issue. Empirical evidences show that the crimes are committed by the youngsters who come from the families practice inferior values. The family, therefore, should set the norms of society.

One of the major problems facing the world today is the growing number of refugees. The developed nations in the world should tackle this problem by taking in more refugees. To what extent do you agree with this opinion?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
Today the world finds itself facing the severe refugee crisis since the Second World War. Each day the wretched people are fleeing from their home. Quite a few human rights organizations are pleading with wealthy states to provide asylum for more refugees so as to curb the crisis. In the instance, however, I partially agree with the notion, while believing that we could quell this issue only when we address the root cause of this refugee crisis.
To commence with, thousands of refugees are on the move, seeking sanctuary to protect themselves from war, persecution, and poverty at home. These destitute people desperately need shelter. But, the developed nations often is demonstrating the staggering lack of humanity and political will to grapple with this refugee crisis. They reluctant to provide refugees with sanctuary, pleading security cause. Obviously, security is a great concern. But as a matter of humanity, and in accordance with international obligations freely entered into, the first world countries should accept a responsibility towards the remedy of this world refugee crisis. They ought to admit that refugees are not terrorist, they are victims. Besides, most of the refugees are women and children, and violence against women, including rape, has become prevalent in conflicts worldwide. So, these vulnerable people should be allowed to get visa as all human beings have the right to be protected from human rights violations.
However, in order to deal with this growing refugee crisis, we have to deal with cause of this issue. If we delve deeply into this phenomenon, then we, in the most cases, will see that wars and planned destabilization are the root cause of the surge of millions of destitute refugees flooding across the Mediterranean Sea and across European borders. The largest portion of refugees are fleeing from war-torn Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, South Sudan, Jordan, and Libya. For example, the U.S in Iraq from 1990 to 2003 includes systematic, massive destruction of infrastructure and 13 years of economic embargo brought about catastrophic ruin and sparked sectarian conflicts have rippled through the region, which in turn, caused 4.7 million people to be refugee. However, none of these wars are for humanitarian purposes. Each war is a great source of huge profit in military contracts for U.S and European corporations. I, therefore, want to argue that we have to avert the war-caused havoc if we really eager to grapple with the increasing refugee crisis.
To reiterate, the wars have swollen the number of refugee in this era of war-on-terror. Despite of security concern, all the developed nations should not turn their back on these refugees. These states ought to provide the refugees with asylum in order to tackle this crisis. From the above discussion, however, it could be concluded that there is a dire need of a robust political will to end these wars so that the permanent solution to this issue can take place.

Some people say that sports should not be encouraged in schools because they cause competition rather than cooperation among students. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
Sports, in common parlance, are an activity involving physical exertion and competence in which an individual or team competes against another for entertainment. Although sports bring forth several benefits associated with the form of competition, some people contend that its disadvantages outweigh its advantages when it comes to the point whether sports should be encourage in schools. They believe that sports are merely a competition that damages cooperation among students. In the case, as far as I am concerned that I completely agree with the notion.
To commence with, sports are very essential for both the physical and mental health of an individual. It contributes to students’ physical health significantly. It strengthens the lungs, bones, and heart above all. Apart from that, it reduces blood sugar level, controls weight, and helps veins and arteries clear. In tandem, sports enhance emotional well-being of the students. Many studies reveal that it may play a therapeutic role in addressing a number of psychological disorders such as, depression, anxiety, psychological distress, emotional disturbance, and so on.
However, in reality, sports cause stiff competition among the students. Which by consequence harms camaraderie among students. Many a time, students start criticizing one another. On the top of that, bullying and quarrelling may stem from competition. A case in point was an inter-school football tournament of my school days. The final match was marred due to a quarrel broke out between the players that rippled through the supporters as well. In addition to this, in the sports, the focus often shifts from sport spirit to winning only. Which by consequence may turn into stress and anxiety-filled job for the students. The mounting pressure to perform well can make them feel bad and they may lose their confidence.
To wrap up, ideally, sports can encourage cooperation, but it, in reality, harms the camaraderie among the students. All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume that schools should not promote sports, since schools are the place where good attitudes should be shaped, not the one that can cause negative impact on the students.

Some people believe that countries should invite foreign companies to open their branches, offices and factories in order to develop their economies. Others think countries should invest in their own companies instead. 
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
A new wave of globalization has taken the world by storm. It has blurred almost all the marks preventing international trade and commerce. As a result, the transnational companies set up their branch offices across the globe. However, people are split in their opinions when it comes to the point of thriving economy. Some people contend that multinational companies could contribute to the economy significantly, but the others, on the other hand, insist that countries should invest in their local companies instead. In my opinion, I believe that the governments should support local entrepreneurs in order to sustainable development.
The proponent of transnational companies hold that these corporations create positive economic value in the host nations through the application of huge capital, cutting-edge technology, and a range of competencies. According to them, the obvious effect evidenced is the improvement in the living standard of the country’s population, as consumers are directly benefited from the lower price, higher quality commodities, and broader selection. Moreover, multinational companies contribute to the increase in national income through its improved productivity and yield and its suppliers. Besides, these companies offer bulk of employment that generates income of the population, which in turn alleviates poverty.
In contrast, the antagonists of the overseas companies call for the investment in local companies. Several reasons are put forward by them. First of all, they plead government to invest in local business, since it helps generate and preserve local job opportunities, and ensures robust local economies. Secondly, local business attainment generates increased tax revenues for the localities, which can be exerted to cater crucial community needs and basic amenities. Last but not the least, since local companies are likely to rely on local service providers and vendors, such investment also has a ripple effect that helps ensure local money will remain and recirculate within the community.  That is to say, investment in local companies insures local money against being moved out of the host country.
In conclusion, many countries tend to invest millions dollars in infrastructure such as, special economic zones, for the multinational corporations. Many economists support the policy that they plead that this is essential for economic development, while others refute the notion and demands that government should invest in local companies. In my opinion, foreign companies are dangerous for the host country. Let me elaborate a bit more. Transnational companies are huge organization. They will come and will compete with the small local companies, and these local companies will eventually be shut down, or be absorbed by the huge multinational companies, and therefore, local people will no longer have companies of their own.

Today, more universities graduates are unable to find jobs. Discuss the causes of rising unemployment among young adults and suggest any solutions.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
Nowadays, a large number of universities graduates fails to find jobs. They are unable to meet the demands of employers, largely owing to the inconsistence between tertiary education and social demand. In addition, the university enrollment also contribute to the phenomenon. However, the government and scholars should work hand in hand so as to instigate a programme of reforms in our education system.
The high employment rate among university graduates is caused by the lack of competencies associated with job fields. University graduates very often fail to demonstrate the skills needed in the labour market. The labour market is ever changing, and with development of globalization, it requires transversal competencies are highly valued by the employers, for example communication skills, analytical abilities, intercultural skills, a talent to work in team and on projects, business acumen, and so on. Empirical evidences shows that many university graduates do not possess these skills, and thus fail to entertain the needs of the employers. Besides, the expanding university enrollment is another key reason of youth unemployment.
In order to grapple with the issue, the government should introduce an active labour market policy. That is to say, the government ought to instigate a set of programmes that intervene in the labour market to assist university graduates to find jobs. The government may introduce public employment services. For instance, if the government establishes job centres that disseminate information about vacancies and provide graduates with assistance pertaining to interview skills and writing a CV. The government also can introduce training schemes, for example apprenticeships and classes that would help the young adults improve their vocational competencies and hence enhance their employability. However, most importantly, the government should reform current education system in order to curb the graduate unemployment effectively over the long term. The government should devise the teaching method and content so that the students can engage to the real world and studying at the same time, to gain new knowledge and experience.
To reiterate, today’s young people embody tomorrow’s workforce. Unfortunately, they are driven to the edged of cliff as they are not armed with the weapon of skills required for the workplace. There is a severe risk of squandering the talents of these graduates if an effective, co-ordinated policy is not taken immediately. To that end, the government should instigate fundamental reforms of the education system and should introduce active labour market policy as well.

Some say parents whose children are breaking law should be punished in some way.

To what extent do u agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
Juvenile delinquency has risen considerably than ever before. In many circles, it is argued that parents ought to be punished in some way. In contrast, others concede that it does not necessarily parents’ fault, although it is the onus on them to rear their children so that they become responsible citizen towards society. In this instance, I am of my honest opinion that nobody should be punished for the crime he has not committed at all.
To commence with, nowhere can you find such a parent who does not want his offspring to be polite and responsible human being. Every parent always tries to do his best for bringing up a child so as to he can become a sensible man. Even though, parents never flinch from doing tedious jobs to meet their children need. Not only do they provide amenities, but also they teach their children about how to be a sensible human being. Nevertheless, some children may engage in anti-social activities. And parents of these children always discourage such activities. They try to convince the child. They scold the child sometimes. Notwithstanding the love and scolding used in parenting, the child may become recalcitrant. So, this will be really unfair to punish the parents for their child’s offence.
Besides, there are other factors what may indulge a child to engage in anti-social activities. It is seen that children very often are influenced by the violent movies or TV programmes and gangs around them. Characters of these movies are presented in pompous fashion and the exposure to violence that may easily entice the children involving in anti-social activities. That is to say that the heavy exposure to violence through movies, TV programmes, Internet sites, video games, and even cartoons has long been associated with a rise in the probability that a child will become susceptible to violence and behave in antisocial and aggressive ways. Another key fact is that antisocial behaviour may also developed by the child’s irritability and temperament. Several factors, thus, contribute to the development of children antisocial behaviour which have no relation to parents.
To recapitulate, parents always try to ensure their children not to involve in activities deemed as antisocial in nature. Besides, there are other factors lie in the social context the children live in contribute to the shaping antisocial behaviour. Above all, the state or society has no moral justification to punish anybody who does not commit crimes. That is why, I firmly believe that it will be injustice to the parents if they are punished for their children’s crime.

Overpopulation of urban areas has led to numerous problems.
Identify one or two serious ones and suggest ways that governments and individuals can tackle these problems.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
These days, urban population is increasing alarmingly. The large numbers of population have swollen the ranks of the unemployed. Moreover, the highly dense population causes environmental pollution. However, we can curb the problem by dealing with the root cause of the issue.
To begin with, several problems are stemmed from the growing number of population in the cities. First of all, it increases youth unemployment, which by consequence impacts on the cities severely. The crimes rate of urban areas has been increased ever than before. Many gangs operate their anti-social activities in tandem with idle young adults. For instance, many studies reveal that most crimes are committed jobless youth population. Apart from that, many people have their own private vehicles, which have brought forth traffic congestion on the road, thus exhaust emissions also contribute to the global warming. On the top of that, the scarcity of decent accommodation is also an increasing problem that the cities must grapple with.
However, we can quell the issues by dealing with the root cause. If we delve deeply into this phenomenon, we will see that the uneven urbanization is the root cause of overpopulation. The facilities for example, education, employment, health care, basic infrastructure etc. have only been concentrated to the urban areas. The basic amenities such as water supply, 24 hours electricity, and good roads still seem to be a part of dream in many rural areas across the globe. As a result of this, people are migrating to the big cities in the hope of a better life.
To recapitulate, people are moving to the cities, which in turn causes myriad of problems such as, youth unemployment, crimes, pollutions, indecent housing, and so forth. The root cause of these overcrowded cities is the urbanization. In the case, rural development would stem the flood of population in the cities.

Nowadays, local shops have been replaced by large supermarkets. Do you think its advantages outweigh the disadvantages?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
In this day and age, corner shops are being disappeared by the mushroom growth of supermarkets. These grand supermarkets provide consumers with a wide variety of commodities and services under a single roof. In contrast, it possesses a real threat to the small retail shops. In the instance, I am of the honest opinion that the advantage of these supermarkets does not outweigh the disadvantage, but rather its disadvantage outweighs its advantage.
To begin with, supermarket offers a large, diverse selection and competitive prices. The supermarkets, usually, provide everything from branded grocery items to fresh, locally grown vegetables and fruits. Consumers can choose from diverse products tailored for unique need. Not only do supermarkets offer a wide range of commodities, but also it serves quality products and services. For example, meat is sealed in packets, vegetables and fruits are prewashed, frozen or prepacked, biscuits are wrapped in cellophane. Another key point to remember is that there is fierce competition between supermarket chains which allow consumers to get the products at a cheaper price.
The other side of the coin, hypermarket adversely affects the communities. First of all, it leads to corner shops closing. Every day, the local greengrocers, bakeries, butchers, and fishmongers are being shut down. Which by consequence causes unemployment for people. Not only do these hypermarkets shrink the business possibility for local people, but also there is a lack of choice for locals buying groceries. Secondly, consumers are often duped into believing deceptive discount pricing techniques. To give an illustration of what I mean, let’s look at the case of supermarkets’ pricing policy. They push down prices for some commodities, while inflating the prices for other items. That is to say that these supermarkets give with one hand and take with the other. To cap it all, the hypermarket takes money out of the local communities. For instance, a recent study reveals that the half of the turnover of an independent local retailer goes back to the local community, while just 5% of the turnover of a hypermarket does.
To wrap up, supermarkets offer convenient shopping experience, while having negative aspects. The negative impacts ripple through the community. All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume that its advantages do not outweigh its disadvantages.

International marketing is sometimes seen as invasive and an intrusion into the country in question. Others argue that it is a necessary and economical form of education in addition to spreading ideas, language and culture.
Discuss both views and state which one do you agree with.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
Gone are the day when companies had to confine to its own territory. Now many companies look to penetrate new markets across the globe with the help of globalization and open market economy. The transnational companies develop global marketing campaign to tap new markets so as to sell their commodities. Which by consequence disseminates ideas, language and culture. In contrast, many people associate global marketing with cultural imperialism.
The multinational companies usually develop marketing strategy including new ideas, language and culture. Their visibility attracts both the consumers and the entrepreneurs. Consequently, the local entrepreneurs can be acquainted with exotic notions, cultures and languages and can learn lot more things about how to conduct a global marketing campaign so that they would be able to conduct similar campaign to establish their own brands. Apart from this, the transnational corporations often merge with local companies. This is because an emerging international brand, establishing partnership with other companies in the country is very crucial for success. And very these multinational corporations organize workshops in order to train the local executives and workers so that they can hone their skill and can elevate their competence to the international level. The transnational companies, thus, essentially provide local entrepreneurs and executive with an economical form of education consisting new ideas, cultures and languages.
On the flip side, the antagonists of global marketing deem it as invasive and intrusion into the country.  That is to say, international marketing is a kind of cultural imperialism. At its simplest form, the notion of cultural imperialism refers to the process of imperialism which poses an unequal power relationship that connotes the dominance of the west. In fact, cultural imperialism has two-fold goals; one is economical and the other is political. In the economic point of view, the transnational companies capture market in the country for it cultural commodities and establish hegemony by moulding popular consciousness. A good example here is the advertisement of Pepsi “Live for Now” campaign. The campaign features a pool of summer activities that depict participants having an exciting time. Pepsi also introduced new limited edition cans featuring the popular singer and American icon, Michael Jackson. Pepsi with the American phrase and icon, thus, exports the culture of America to other countries. Likewise, in the political arena, cultural imperialism plays a paramount role in separating people from their traditions of solidarity and cultural roots, replacing them with media generated need which changes with every other campaign. The political impact is so alarming that it alienates people from traditional class and community knot, atomizing the society and separating people from one another.
In fine, international marketing spreads new knowledge and consumer culture as well. This consumer culture goes beyond popular consumptions that brings about concern of the dominance of the western culture what impacts on the values of societies, and in turn, on the political realm. The transnational corporations transmit western lifestyle and ideology seemed as corrosive to the recipient countries’ culture. The intrusion of western consumer culture into the everyday lives of the recipient countries is actually a new form of colonialism.

Nowadays more and more people have to compete with young people for the same jobs. What problems does this cause? What are some possible solutions? 
Identify one or two serious ones and suggest ways that governments and individuals can tackle these problems.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
Today, the increasing number of experienced job seekers have to compete with young adults for the same job positions. This phenomenon causes youth unemployment, which in turn impacts society severely. However, in my opinion, the governments and educationists should work hand in hand so as to reform current educational system in order to grapple with the issue.
The growing competition between the older and young adults brings about several crises in society, youth unemployment in particular. The high youth unemployment may contribute to the risk of competencies and talent since a large amount of university graduates are found difficulty to get a job and to put their capabilities and knowledge they have gained into producing innovation and contributing to economic growth. In addition, youth unemployment could also harm the happiness and mental health. Being employed is crucial for young adults so as to feel accepted in the community, thus not having a job can hold them in cultural, economic, and social isolation. Employment anxieties and social exclusion may cause various health problems, like depression. Besides, several studies reveal that youth unemployment is associated with juvenile delinquency and drug abuse as well.
However, in order to curb this issue, governments and educationalists should work together so as to reform current education system. That is to say that the curriculum needs to offer courses that enable students to acquire business acumen and mandatory skills required to successfully manage a position.  Besides, employers also can play a paramount role in quelling the problem. They should connect with students earlier by providing apprenticeships and mentors so that these young people could be well-equipped for the job field.
In pithy, the competition seems likely to contribute to the youth unemployment that has a ripple effect through the society. However, governments and educationists should devise new education system squaring with real-world job requirements. Apart from that, employers also should provide adequate internships for students so that they grab the skills associated with professional ambience.

Write about the following topic:
Some people argue that economic growth should be promoted to end poverty and hunger. Others believe that it is damaging our environment so it should be stopped.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.

You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Essay 1:
Poverty and hunger is the most pressing issue in many developing countries. In many circles, it is argued that economic growth can quell the poverty and hunger. Conversely, others want to rein economic growth back as it brings forth environmental damage. Although it is a good point against the economic growth, I personally believe that economic growth plays a paramount role in alleviating poverty and hunger and economy can be thrived without compromising the environment.
Economic growth is the key instrument for eradicating poverty and ameliorating the quality of life in poorer countries. The growth can create a virtuous circle of opportunity and prosperity. A booming economy and job opportunities inspires parents to invest in their children education by sending them to school. This may cause the emergence of a sturdy and growing group of entrepreneurs. And it goes without saying that when people are able to generate their income, then the poverty and hunger will be eclipsed by the prosperity. In the instance, many studies reveal that the sustained and rapid growth is the single most crucial approach to curb poverty. A good example here is Vietnam. Between 1993 and 2002, poverty fell by 7.8% a year, halving the poverty rate from 58% to 29%. The evidence testifies that poverty and hunger can be conquered by a strong economic growth.
On the other hand, economic growth may impact on environment substantially. Example include the over exploitation of fish stocks, the destruction of forest through deforestation, loss of natural habitat and bio-diversity from the construction of new roads and highways, high-rise buildings, hotels, shopping malls, and industrial zones. However, growth means more production and more consumption, which in turn contribute to the huge expansion of waste and pollution. On the top of that, the huge production uses a substantial amounts of energy, burning more fossil fuels. As a result of burning fossil fuels, the climate is got warm eventually.
In my opinion, historically nothing has work better than economic growth in qualifying societies to ameliorate the living standards of their members, including those who at the very bottom. However, the growth also harms the environment severely. To that end, economic growth should be decoupled from the environmental damage by devising eco-friendly activities and innovating green technology.
Sample Essay 2:
Many parts across the world suffer pandemic poverty and hunger. The economists suggests that economic growth is the silver bullet to battle with poverty and hunger. On the other hand, the environmentalists shed light on the fatal damages of environment cause by economic growth. Both the sides have merits. However, I believe that we can boost economy while minimizing environmental damages.
To commence with, the governments in many developing countries put emphasize on some sectors, for example tourism, to eradicate poverty and hunger. Not only is tourism is seen as a key instrument for regional development, but also it embarks upon new economic activities. To do so, the government initiates developmental programme constructing several general infrastructures such as, roads and highways, airports, and so on. In addition, both the government and the private corporations make sure some essential tourism facilities like hotels, resorts, restaurants, shopping mall, golf course, marinas, and so forth. As a result, this development has tremendous positive economic impact on employment, on GDP, and on the balance of payments. Which by consequence ameliorates the living standards of marginal community by alleviating poverty and hunger. That is to say, local people can be employed in tourism enterprise, goods and services provided to the tourists. Another key point is that they may small and community-based enterprises. Eventually, they will no longer remain poor and hungry.
On the flip side, these developmental activities have adverse effects on environment. Tourism often poses potential threats to the natural resources of the area. It can put immense pressure on the area which in turn contributes to soil erosion, contaminating sea and river, natural habitat loss, and so on. For example, forests are likely suffered by the tourists in the form of deforestation. They collect wood for fuel. One trekking tourist in Nepal, a country is suffering the impacts of deforestation, usually uses 4 to 5 kilograms of wood a day revealed by a local survey report.
From what has been discussed above, economic growth can be deemed as double-edged sword as contributing to both the curbing poverty and hunger, and the damaging environment simultaneously. But we can reduce environmental damages caused by economic activities. What we need is to introduce well-planned eco-friendly tourism instead of uncontrolled conventional tourism. So, I believe we can fight against poverty and hunger by boosting economic growth without damaging environment.

Write about the following topic:
Some people say that to become a good teacher, you should acquire enough training, while others say that teaching capabilities can be developed with experience. 
Discuss both views and give your opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Teachers are supposed to be the architect of a nation. However, when it comes to the point that what makes a good teacher, people are split in their opinions. Some educators contend that sufficient training is essential to be a good teacher, while others refute and argue that experience is the key to become a good teacher. After discussing both the points, I will put forth my opinion.
To begin with, teachers have many challenges they face every day. An effective training prepares teachers how to deal with those challenges in a better fashion. In addition to this, it also teaches many approaches on how to connect with students. Similarly, teachers can learn the cutting-edge teaching methods from training session. Another key thing to remember, effective training program addresses the causes of teacher burnout and teaches how to handle it. In a nutshell, an effective training program prepares teachers with the right skills. It equips teachers with knowledge and skills are essential to become an ideal teacher.
However, experience also matters in being a good teacher. Experience can make teachers quick and sharp. Experienced teachers know how to respond to complex situation. Besides, they can group students according to their level of merit and can provide them with particular solution to the particular group. Furthermore, teachers can learn various effective approaches of teaching from the real life experience are crucial for the student’s achievement.
In my opinion, training program cannot prepare teachers for every issue they will face each day in the classroom. Besides, not all the knowledge they attain in training programs is appropriate for a specific group of students. A teacher with experience can understand which method would be helpful for his students. Even, he can tailor the methods to devise the most appropriate approach for his pupil. Therefore, both the experience and the training are important to be a good teacher.
In fine, I would like to say that sufficient training gives the teachers with tools and experience guides them how to use these tools. In fact, the combination of the two is the cornerstone of a good teacher.

Write about the following topic:
Some people think parents should control the behaviour of children from a very young age but others think we should give them more freedom.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Essay:
Children, at very early age, are susceptible to world around them. They cannot differentiate good and bad. Therefore, many a parents wants to pull the harness on their children from really a tender age. In contrast, others opine that children need liberty to be a complete man. However, I am of the honest opinion that the combination of control and independence is better approach than emphasizing any one of the two.
Admittedly, it is the onus of parents to guide and control their toddlers so that they can act in a proper manner. Parents should instill the ethics and values in their children. More importantly, the control is needed to teach them about submission. To give an illustration, in our lives, each and everybody has to submit himself to some kind of authority. People are controlled and obey discipline in order to avert chaos. Therefore, parents should set rules to control young children and provide them with limits that what they can and cannot do. This is because young children are like clay and you can shape the form you like to.
On the flip side, freedom makes young children self-reliant. It provides children with the opportunity of exploring mistakes by themselves and solves issues on their own way. When children can solve problems alone, they would be more confident that will fuel self-esteem. Another key thing to remember, creativity is very vital for all of us. And a child would be creative only when he is allowed to make his own choice and do things in their own approach. Therefore, parents should ensure positive environment so that their children can hone their creative skills.
Based on aforementioned arguments, I would like to say that independence and control are the linchpin in parenting. Toddlers are like clay that parents can form the shape as their wish. In contrast, excess control can make them rebellious. So, what I want to say is that young children need liberty and control in a proper proportion.

An increasing number of people decide to learn a foreign language. What is the most difficult part when learning a foreign language? How can the learner overcome these difficulties?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Nowadays, a growing number of people tend to learn foreign language in order to be completely functional in our global village. But learners face many difficulties such as, cultural differences, interference of the mother tongue. In the case, knowledge of the target language’s culture and avoidance of mother tongue interference could abate the obstacles of learning the target language.
To commence with, cultural barrier is the main obstacle in learning a foreign language. Learning a language means learning to comprehend and speak the target language. In the case, each language has a unique cultural context and learners can understand the language and communicate with the speaker of the target language only when he is comprehensive knowledge on the culture. On the top that, mother tongue interference can impede learning a second language as learners apply their first language to learn a second language. First language, in fact, obstructs the proper internalization of the target language’s rules, causing error of syntax, vocabulary and pronunciation.
To that end, learners should put emphasize on every day speed as language is mainly spoken. So, foreign language learners should study common, everyday speech in the target language. They also need to knowledge about culture comprising the history of people who speak the target language, the geography of the land where the language is used and the information of the daily lives of the target language’s speakers.
To reiterate, cultural difference and mother tongue hampers the learning process of a foreign language. In order to deal with these issues, learn should gather knowledge of the target language’s culture and try to use the language in their real life context.


Some people think spending a lot on birthdays and marriage celebrations is a waste of money but others think it is important to the young people and the society.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
People get paid far more than ever before with boost of economic development. Consequently, they tend to spend substantial sums of money on several occasions like, birthday and marriage anniversary. In many circle, it is argued that the money goes in vain. In contrast, others opine that the pompous celebration of these occasions is crucial for both the young people and the society. While both the sides have merits, I inclined to the later notion.
It goes without saying that gaudy celebrations of birthday and marriage anniversary come with high cost. Thousands of dollars are spent on only a single evening event. According to many people, it does not make any sense. The proponents argue that the money could be spent on charitable activities. The money would be great help for the poverty-ridden African children. This money, thus, could the souvenir of humanity.
However, the lavish marriage or birthday party can contribute to the society. First of all, it tightens the social bonds. These events offer the great opportunity to come close with relatives and friends. Secondly, having fun with friends and family, we can boost our energy and can return to work refreshed mind. These occasions, thus, are relief moment from our modern hectic lives. Last but not the least, these parties mend our personal relationships between parents and children, and husband and wife. Thus, these events have many utilities.
To wrap up, a substantial amount of money is used in many occasions like, birthday, marriage anniversary, and so forth. While some people deem that people are squandering their money on these expensive parties, others see it in a positive angle. All things considered, it seems to reasonable to assume that the expense is not waste at all as it effects positively on both the society and the individuals.

Many university graduates leave university facing uncertainty and unemployment. What are the causes and effects of this problem? Offer some solutions.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
In recent years, many university graduates succumb to uncertainty and remain jobless. It is a devastating phenomenon in the lives of graduates, family and society as a whole. Several causes lay in the fact, such as incompetence, excessive supply of graduates for certain arenas, education itself, and so on. However, several measures could tame the condition.
Several factors contribute to the issue. First of all, many a graduates has lack of skills. Consequently, they cannot attract employers in the interview board. Secondly, there is a huge supply of graduates in some particular fields. As a result, the graduates who complete their study in these fields are likely to be unemployed. Last but not the least, there are shortcomings in education system. The current education system does meet the ever changing workplace environment. To give an illustration of what I mean is that twenty first century economy demands some particular competences, such as creativity, communication, innovation, and collaboration, and unfortunately our system produces graduates who are not equipped with those skills.
However, the jobless graduates fall in despair. They become the burden of family. On the top of that, unemployment may provoke them to engage in anti-social activities. They may commit heinous crime or may start using psychoactive drugs. Thus, the unemployment put the unfortunate graduates into the turmoil, not to mention its impact on society.
Now let’s move on to the solutions to this grave issue. From the tender age, children should be raised in such an environment so that they can hone several social skills and can develop cognitive abilities. In addition, the problems that exist in the education system need to be addressed and handled, and all stakeholders have to take the responsibilities in solving those issues. Therefore, reformation in education system is the demand of present condition.
To wrap up, a substantial number of university graduates are left in uncertainty due to unemployment. Lack of skills and education system are the main contributor to this issue. It impacts on both the individuals and the society as a whole. In the case, shaping skills and reforming education system can uplift the condition, I think.

Write about the following topic:
Radio will no longer be able to hold its presence as television and Internet media will replace it very soon. 
Do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
The invention of new media has always posed a challenge to the older ones. The old medium is replaced by new one or losses its dominant position. However, many people forecast that radio will lose its prevalence due to the popularity of television and Internet. In my opinion, I wholeheartedly concur with the notion.
Admittedly, television will reign over radio. Unlike radio, television is an audio-visual medium, and the current generation tends to watch television more than listening radio. For instance, whenever any especial event comes, I turn off the radio and go to watching television. Similarly, in the case of any live program or sports events, people prefer television rather than radio. Most importantly, television provides the viewers with a sneak peak, live footage of what is coming about locally, nationally, and globally nowadays. Because of various kinds of communication things it offers, television has the prospect to win the radio’s position.
Likewise, Internet has declared a new horizon of communication. People are able to keep in touch with family, friends, relatives, and colleagues from anywhere in the globe. Not only can they talk face to face, but also they can follow one another through several social networks like Google Plus, Twitter, Facebook, and so on. Another key point to remember, Internet has brought a revolutionary change in conventional news broadcasting like radio. The e-papers offer news in the blink of eyes. Whenever anything happens anywhere across the globe, it gets published on the Internet in a matter of minutes. In addition, internet is the huge ocean of entertainment. Millions of songs, movies, dramas, novels, poetry are found on the Internet. The Internet, thus, puts it ahead of radio.
In conclusion, the evidence points almost exclusively to the argument that television and Internet will degrade radio current position.

Present a written argument or case to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic.
“Prevention is better than cure.”
Researching and treating diseases is too costly so it would be better to invest in preventive measures.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
You should write at least 250 words.
You should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.
Model Answer :
The old adage that prevention is better than cure. Today, more than ever before, researching and treating diseases has become prohibitively expensive. Which is why, the view is widely held that it would be better if we invest in precautionary measures. But, my own position is rather different. This is because, preventive measure, without exceptions, saves money. In my opinion, therefore, the state should invest in researching and treating diseases.
For a start, prevention measures are effective only in few cases. Childhood vaccines, and perhaps some adult vaccines (such as for the flu and pneumonia) are cost effective. The immunizations are cheap, and a large swathe of the population is affected to the diseases they prevent. The cost of catering the immunizations to everyone is less than that of treating the diseases they prevent. These, however, are exceptions.
On the other hand, there is many a deadly diseases that scientists and doctors are yet to fully comprehend. In the cases, we have to invest substantial amounts of money to find out the root causes curing the diseases. Besides, every day, new diseases break out in many part of the world. A very good example here is the Ebola outbreak in Africa. No one ever imagines it that it is spreading like wildfire.  As it is a new phenomenon, we have to research to find out the causes and treatment of the disease, even for preventive measures. If we invent the treatment of the disease, we then would save thousands of lives. We, therefore, should spend substantial sums of money on research and treatment of diseases.
In conclusion, I would not say that some preventive measures do not reap savings. Childhood vaccines and some adult vaccines are good example. But, the preventive measures that actually save money are the exceptions. In contrast, many diseases are yet to be comprehended. So, the government should keep the research and treatment running by investing money.

Write about the following topic:
People find it very difficult to speak in public or to give a presentation before an audience. Do you think public speaking skill is really important? Give reasons. Some people say public speaking should be taught at school. Do you agree or disagree?

You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Essay:
Public speaking, in common parlance, is an act of speaking or delivering a speech to group of people in a structured manner. It is an utterly essential skill, many a people is naïve at the competence, although. That is why many people argue that public speaking should be included in the schools’ curriculum. In this instance, I concur with the notion whole heatedly.
There is not a shred of doubt that public is extremely critical in many aspects of life. Public speaking is the skill that fuels self-confidence dramatically. In addition, it makes one more comfortable around people, even strangers. Not only does it make one confident and comfortable, but equally public speaking hones every verbal and non-verbal communication competences, which by consequence keep someone ahead of competitors in the workplace. That is to say, communication streamlines an organization that that is utterly important for its success and, so thus the employers are likely to select those who are good at communication skills. Furthermore, as it allows one to demonstrate knowledge and wisdom, he, then, usually gets promotions relatively earlier than his counterparts. Another key point to remember, it also eases conjugal and family life.
However, most people are inept at public speaking that they feel fear and anxiety. To that end, many educators suggest that schools’ curriculum should embrace public speaking. They argue that a class should be dedicated to allowing pupils to sharp their verbal communication skills and make them confident with a skill set that would prepare them for the future.
In fine, I would like to say that we should put more focus on public speaking in class just because no matter in what field it is needed, it is that skill we need at some point in our lives. Unfortunately, most of us feel tense when they are on the podium. Therefore, we require a robust curriculum to deal with anxiety and fear in order for surpassing the current condition.

Some people say that money can make life easier and more comfortable. But others say that having a lot of money can bring some problems. 
What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of having a lot of money?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
There is not a single shred of doubt that money plays the most vital role in the world we live in. Money makes the easier and far cosy. If one is lucky to have it, he is lucky. However, having a pile of money causes some advantage and disadvantage, as it is a double-edge sword. In the essay, I will discuss both the benefits and drawbacks of belonging plenty of money.
Several advantages stem from abundance of money. First of all, it makes someone’s life easier and comfortable as he can buy what make his life easy. He can lead a cosy life ensuring amenities. Secondly, the affluent man can contribute to the society. To give an illustration of what I mean, let us look at the issue of unemployment. He can create job opportunities by establishing industries. With mountains of money, a man, thus, could be savior of hundreds of unemployed youths. Another key thing to remember, in our capitalist society, the amount of money determines the social status of an individual. An individual with an abundance of money can enjoy a dignified social status.
However, like every other thing, money has dark side as well. More often, a great deal of money can change human behaviour. It can make people boastful. An amiable person may turn into an unpleasant individual. On the top of that, money often causes addiction to get more money. Thereby, a man can use unfair means to earn more money. The abundance of money, thus, could be catalyst in performing many evil acts.
All in all, everybody wants to money at any cost. In this modern world, money keeps us alive. Without it, we face multitudes of problems, while our life would be harmed with the pile of money. This is the dilemma of money, unfortunately.

Some people think that children should obey rules or do what their parents and teachers want them to do, but others think that children controlled too much cannot deal with problems well by themselves. 
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Children are considered the builders of a nation. So, our future depends on true parenting of the children. But when it comes to the issue people are split in their opinions. Some people contend that children should obey the voice of their parents and teachers. While others refute the notion that children are controlled strictly, and argue that children deserve freedom so that they can learn how to deal with problems. As both the arguments have their merits, I believe the combination of the two approaches can bring better result in raising children.
To start with, children should follow steps as suggested by parents and mentors. The proponents of the argument want the children to learn to respect authority. They argue that it is utterly important, because this is how children can understand their proper role in life. Everybody has some kinds of authorities, and teaching youngsters to submit to those authorities from the tender age will be conducive in the whole span of their lives.
On the flip side of coin, the champions of children freedom plead that children are not supposed to be robots blindly following either parents or teachers. Children should learn for themselves what is wrong and right, and need to demonstrate their personalities. They contend that if children do not know how to deal with problems for themselves, they, then, indeed will not able to solve a unique problem any may always depend on others. They cannot stand alone. So, they must be critical at what they are to be said. A healthy dollop of critical thought is utterly important in children’s moral parenting.
All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume that both the approaches are handy, but what we need to do is to mix the ways in a proper proportion. A perfect match of freedom and control is extremely critical in children upbringing, I believe.

Some people think the main benefit of international cooperation is in protection of the environment, while others think that the main benefit is in the worldwide business. 
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
We live in a global village where international cooperation is the key for achieving several global goals, particularly improving environment and boosting trade and commerce. However, some people believe that global concurrence contributes chiefly to protecting environment. In contrast, others oppose that and infer that the collaboration expands business globally. In my opinion, it benefits to extending business more than protecting environment.
It goes without saying that international cooperation plays a paramount role in environmental protection. In fact, environmental issues are transboundary in nature. So, domestic step alone is not sufficient to fully address environmental issues. Here, the nations are exchanging improved sets of climatological, meteorological, and environmental satellite data in order for quelling the environmental concerns. In addition, the developed countries share eco-friendly technologies with developing countries. These sophisticated technologies improve environment substantially.
Similarly, international collaboration has changed the business landscape radically. It fuels the potentials of trade and investment on a global scale. Global cooperation entices nations to sign trade pacts through economic diplomacy is the driving force for expanding trade and commerce worldwide. Besides, the affluent nations invest on infrastructural development in developing countries. This also greatly contributes to the expansion of international business. Apart from that, the wealthy nations supply technologies that also contribute to the expansion of business. Most importantly, international cooperation overcomes cultural differences, language barriers, tension between nations, and so forth, which by consequence boosts international trade and commerce.
In a nutshell, international cooperation plays a vital role in protecting environment and expanding international business. While it greatly contributes to protecting environment, the predominant benefit of it is worldwide business expansion.

Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from other sources (such as the Internet and television). 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
The technology has brought unprecedented opportunities for learners providing enormous sources, for instance the Internet and television. Notwithstanding the learning opportunities provided by the Internet and television, students still learn much more from the conventional lessons with teachers beyond any shred of doubt.
It goes without saying that the technology has declared a new dawn in education. To give an illustration of what I mean, let’s look at the case of internet. The cutting-edge technology can provide students with millions of information pertaining to their study topics in the blink of an eye. Students can straight go to YouTube and can find many learning materials, for example. Apart from that, there are multitudes of educational sites that can play paramount role in learning. Coupled with the Internet, television invokes the evidence that these sources can contribute to learning. Students can get many lessons from television’s educational programs.
In contrast, teachers contribute more to students’ academic and overall development than any other sources. First of all, teachers can tailor their lessons according to the students’ level of understanding which is impossible for the Internet and television. Let it be clarified. Students likely come from different backdrop and inherently different from one another, and eventually they do not belong to same intelligence. A teacher can group the students and then illustrate a concept in details without complexities what the different groups of students need to know. This is to say, teachers can match their lessons according to different types of students. Another key point to remember is that teachers can also deliver moral lessons that could change students’ lives radically.
Based on above discussion, it could easily be concluded that students can learn far more from lessons provided by teachers than any other sources, specially the Internet and television. No other sources’ lessons can outweigh the lessons of teachers, I think.

As housing is a basic need for people, governments should provide free housing for everyone who can’t afford it. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Government is an elected body that has the onus of taking care of its citizens who formed it. The sole objective of a government is to ensure the welfare of its citizens. Although the needs are diverse, the prime motto of the government is to satisfy the basic needs, such as food, house, education, and so on. In the case, I wholeheartedly agree with the idea that the government should have free housing program for them who cannot afford it.
For a start, government policy should be designed such a way so that they are able to make their citizen capable of living in their own home. The housing of people is on the onus of the government. It is their core responsibility that cannot be ignore in any way. For any welfare state, government is the subject to uplifting the living standard of people. And in the case, housing is one of the basic priorities as it is the fundamental rights of people, I believe. Besides, there has always been a sect of society where people are less fortune. Better way to deal with the issue is ensuring a chance for better standard. Here, the government should provide the less fortunes with free house.
To put it another way, for the sake of democracy, the government is for every community of society, not just those who have prospered in life. The true measure of a democratic state is how it treats its vulnerable community. As wealthy nation like ours, it is very shameful that we have people living on the streets or parks. These people are people too. They are also entitled to have house. The government, therefore, should help the homeless population providing free home.
To sum up, the government is for all. It needs more emphasis on the vulnerable part of the society so that the section could lead a better life. That is why, the government should provide the homeless population with free home, I think.

Old generations often hold some traditional ideas on the correct way of life, thinking and behavior. However, some people think that it is not helpful for the young generations to prepare for modern life in the future. 
What is your opinion?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Old generations often hold some traditional ideas on the correct way of life, thinking and behavior. However, some people think that it is not helpful for the young generations to prepare for modern life in the future.
What’s your opinion?
Old generations very often lean on some conventional values on the present trend of life. They belong to some distinct views dealing with life. Many a people is confused that whether these ideas or values are still handy to fit the young in the coming future. The way I think is that some of the ideas should be accepted, but the young generation ought to develop their own ideas to deal with the future.
For start, some of old generation ideas are still conducive to lead a happy life, while some become obsolete. So, today’s generation should embrace some old norm while need to discard some previous concepts. In fact, needs determine what to accept and what to give up. Observing the current notion about family, typical ideas, beyond any doubt, about family should be embraced for better life in the future. To give an illustration of what I mean, let’s shed light on the case of joint family. Old generations believe in joint family constitutes all the first blood living in the same house. In the joint family, there are many caregivers who can raise children far better than babysitter prevalent in nuclear family of the modern era. On the other hand, old generation’s views on women that they are not subject to engaging profession should not be accepted.
Having said that today’s generation should develop some important values that were helpful for the old generations. Every era has some distinct needs and people need to tailor their way of thinking about life and behaviour according to those needs. To put it another way, we cannot progress human civilization if we do not devise new way of life, the wheel of progress must be stopped. Therefore, we must develop new ideas to lead an ideal life in terms of present and future potential needs.
To reiterate, no man of any epoch has his complete views alone. A particular generation should follow some handy steps of old generation and at the same time should improvise new concept to match the present and future demand.

The level of noise around us is constantly increasing, and is affecting the quality of our lives. What cause the noise? What should be done about it?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
It goes without saying that the scale of noise around us is consistently amplifying. Thereby, it becomes a pressing issue in many cities. Several factors lie in the uptick of sound, such as transportation, industrialization, and so forth. In this instance, both the government and NGOs can take programs to quell the issue.
To commence with, modern lifestyle contribute to the sound pollution largely. With boost of economy, people tend to have private vehicles that cause a large sum of noise. Likewise, people frequently travel by airplane for personal, professional and tourism activities. These excessive tours contribute to the noise substantially. On the top of that, modern lifestyle always demands more amenities and huge machine is used in the industries in order to meet these growing demands. These robust machines produce tremendous amounts of harsh noise. Additionally, playing loud music is another key cause of sound pollution.
To tackle the issue, the government should make some steps, for example educating people, expending money on research for improving technology, etc. Primarily, the government can take program to educate people about sound pollution and its impacts on public health so that the individuals could be motivated not to be cause of sound pollution. Besides, the government can introduce a stringent guideline for sound pollution. Apart from that, non-government organizations may also introduce campaign to calm the noise pollution.
In fine, sound pollution can bring dire consequences. The government can impose strict laws to calm sound pollution. And NGOs also can aware mass people about fatal aftermath of noise so that individuals could be motivated to ameliorate the condition.

In many countries, more and more people are competing for a place to study in universities. Why does this happen? Do you think this is a positive or negative development?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Today’s tertiary education landscape is immensely different from the last couple of decades. Increasing numbers of students are wrestling to secure a place in the universities. This is because higher education has become the key to success in career. As far as I am concerned the trend should be welcomed positively.
Admittedly, we live in a world where everyone is subject to cut-throat competition in order to success in career. In the case, higher education keeps one ahead of other competitors. To put it another way, employers are likely to nominate the employees who have university degree. People with university degree are paid more handsome salary and are promoted regularly than those who do not belong to university degree. Thereby, more and more students take part in the competition to be admitted in a university. In addition to this, with the development of economy, more people are able to afford higher education. So, they are combating for enrolling in universities.
However, the rising competition is obviously a positive development. First and foremost, it develops human resource. Consequently, more people would contribute to the economy and so thus our economy would be fostered. Secondly, competition may develop overall quality of education. That is to say students compete only for the institutions which have good faculty and facilities, learning environments, and so forth, which by consequence causes competition among the universities to attract students with better offers. The increasing competition, thus, may develop individuals and institution as well.
Based on above discussion, it could be easily said that people who have university degree can climb the ladder of success in career. Consequently, more and more students try to enroll in universities. Both the students and the universities are being benefited from this recent trend.

Some schools segregate boys from girls in certain classes as they believe that by separating the sexes, they perform better. 
Discuss both sides of this view and state your opinion on this issue.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Separating boys from girls in certain classes has become a trend recently. The benefits of grouping pupils into a single-sex classroom have been debated for years. The proponent of segregation contends that separate gender classroom boosts students’ academic performance. However, the notion is a double-edge sword, having both positive and negative impacts on students. In my way of thinking, I believe that it could hamper students’ overall development.
The advocates of grouping students into sex argue that single-sex classroom fosters the student’s academic performance. They point to the lack of disruptions as a prime catalyst in inclining single-sex class. They deem that it is much easier for students to pay attention without pretty girl or handsome boy across the way. That is to say, students can find it much handy to concentrate and participate in class. For instance, a student would not be worried constantly that what the boy or girl think of him if he asks a stupid question to the teacher. He performs more actively and so thus can excel his academic performance.
On the flip side of the coin, segregate classroom promotes poor social competence. Students spend their formative years in the classroom honing skills that will help them throughout their life. If students are separated by sex, they are dropped the chances to work together and improve major social skills. Gender-segregated classroom produces youngsters who do not know how to communicate with opposite sex and might promote stereotype that one gender is superior to another. Most importantly, classroom is the preparation for future life and how girls and boys learn to interact will determine relationships forming in the workplace.
In fine, I would like to draw my conclusion that segregate classroom handicap overall development. In the real world, one does not compete only with his or her own sex but with everyone. Co-education thrives the students’ skills to tailor the level of other sex and prepares students to compete irrespective of gender, I believe.

Many old cities around the world are going through a major process of modernization. What are the advantages and disadvantages of modernization?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Modernization, in common parlance, refers to the replacement old into new one. With the dawn of industrial revolution, many ancient cities across the globe has been transforming into new cities. While the process has some benefits, such improved facilities, economic progress, and so on, there are negative impacts as well.
To start with, modernization of old city provides the city dwellers with several advantages. As the increasing numbers of people are moving to cities for employment opportunity with the uptick of economic growth, cities are becoming overpopulated. Consequently, it causes new demands, for example high rise building, wide roads and streets, more amenities for the growing population. Modernization meets these needs to the citizens. In addition to this, it also creates job opportunities. That is to say, modernization embarks on embark on infrastructural development resulting in the plenty of employment opportunities. So, the modernization process proliferates job opportunities, not to mention its effects on elevating living standard of city residents.
Having said that the modernization process too has several drawbacks. First and foremost, it harms the sense of pride. To give an illustration of what I mean, let us look at the case of old historic buildings. These buildings are the direct reflection of our history, heritage, and culture. Demolishing these buildings means our sense of pride. On the top of that, it also contributes to environment concerns. That is to say, new building materials are to be produced for new constructions. Which by consequence increases the consumption of fossil fuels. Thus, not only does modernization of an old city abuse our sense of pride, but also it damages our environment.
To wrap up, renovation of old cities is a double-edge sword. Although there are a pile of advantages, it also jeopardizes our culture and history, and our environment as well. Therefore, we should think twice before renovating an old city.

Some people prefer to provide help and support directly to those in the local community who need it. Others, however, prefer to give money to national and international charitable organisations. 
Discuss both views and give your opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Helping poor and needy is a duty in many religions. However, people are split when it comes the point that how they support them who are in need. In the developing countries, people likely support the poor people directly. On the other hand, people in the western world like give money to the national and international charity organizations. Both the approaches have their own merits.
To commence with, despite the economic boom, hundreds of thousands people are living in pandemic poverty. Many affluent individuals cannot bother the poverty next door. They do not depend on national or international charity organizations, rather they try to support the pauper community so that they can lead a better life. In addition, direct donation to those in need, provides a sense of warm. Besides, they also do not rely on charity organizations due to corruptions. Some corrupt officials try to pocket the donator’s kindness. Consequently, contributors’ charity cannot reach the misfortunes. It is another prime cause of why people donate directly.
However, donators in the wealthy nations very often contribute to the national and international aid organizations. These organizations usually invite electronic and print media’s journalists to highlight their campaign, and eventually the donators are known widely. Therefore, some people like to donate needy through aid organizations. Another key point to remember is that many people want to deal with global issues. That is to say that many African countries are suffering for stark poverty. People of these countries have no shelter, cloths, food, and even pure drinking water. Therefore, citizens from the rich countries donate to the organization in order to calm the unbearable poverty of African nations.
In fine, help in any approach is good whether it is directly or indirectly. It depends on individuals and on the condition of the country.

Everyone should stay in school until the age of eighteen. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Education in every society in every era has a profound importance. In the modern epoch, school plays a vital role in disseminating education. School attendance is compulsory of all children up to a certain age in many societies. In the case, many a people argues that school leaving age should be fixed at 18. In my opinion, I agree with them beyond a shadow of doubt. In the following essay, the reasons could explain why.
First and foremost, school leaving age at 18 ensure more education. And more education provides children with the opportunity to attain more skills and thus more options. It has been frequently shown that those children with more education find it easier to search jobs and that they are more likely to find right jobs with handsome salary.
Secondly, confirming everyone gets education for the same period of time at school can foster equality. At present, early school leaving is connected with other indicators of socio-economic drawback like, low-income jobs or pandemic poverty. In addition to this, parents who left school at early stage and as a result have odd jobs are more likely to have children who also leave school young. Ensuring everyone stay school till eighteen years could break this evil cycle.
Last but not the least, school leaving age at 18 is utterly important investment in nation’s future. It boosts the economic potential of future workforce, and so will fetch more tax revenues eventually compared to the cost of extra school years.
To wrap up, many a children drops from school to pursue jobs that leads to many unwanted consequences. The government, therefore, should mandatory school leaving age at eighteen.

Today’s food travels thousands of miles before it reaches customers. Is this a positive or negative trend?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Nowadays food travels hundreds of thousand miles before it reaches consumers. Consumers are no longer dependent on food that has been grown locally. Day by day, the locavore community tends to be accustomed to buying food produced from all over the globe. However, views differ notably when it comes to the issue whether it is a positive trend or not. While this trend has some benefits to the consumers, I consider it as a negative trend for several reasons.
For a start, it is true that the trend has many advantages to the consumers. First of all, this trend offers a variety of food choices consists of food grown all over the world. For instance, Japanese sushi has become a ubiquitous commodity in U.S that is once exotic among American circles. On the same token, culinary exchanges can lead to calming the tension among the nations.
On the flip side, the trend has enormous negative impact on environment. This is because food travelling certainly needs huge fossil fuels that would contribute to global warming to the great extent. In addition to this, long-distance food will eventually damage our rural economies as small food business and peasants become the most marginal link in the supply chain. Besides, locally grown foods are much fresher than long-distance food. Because, it is harvested at the peak hour of ripeness. Local food does not have to be refrigerated, fumigated, or packaged for long shelf-life and thousand miles hauling. Consequently, it can retain its nutritious value better than long-distance food.
In fine, the trend is a double-edged sword. It has many advantages and possesses great harms at the same time. As far as I am concerned that the negative impact of this trend outweighs its positive sides.

Recent research shows that the consumption of junk food is a major factor in poor diet and this is detrimental to health. Some people believe that better health education is the answer to this problem but others disagree. What is your opinion?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
It goes without saying that eating fast food on a regular basis has dire consequences in diet that leads to obesity and other diseases. People are divided in their opinions when it comes to the issue that how to curb this problem. In many circles, it is contended that education on healthy diet can deal with the issue, while others refute the notion. In the case, I am of my honest opinion that education about hygienic eating habit can quell the matter.
First of all, well-designed nutrition education has a profound impact on obesity. Many studies show that food habit adapted at the early age is hard to change or influence. Without proper nutritional education, children are susceptible to poor eating habits that may lead to childhood obesity. On the top of that, obesity is not only detrimental for physical health, but also it affects mental health. In the instance, education on healthy food and nutrition can encourage children to make healthy eating choices can aid to alleviate the widespread presence of obesity and its consequences. Like children, adults should have proper knowledge about food and its nutrition value as we continue to make food choices throughout the course of our lifetime.
Secondly, junk food can lead to fatal illness. When people have proper education about food and nutrition, they would certainly avoid those foods are hazardous for health. For example, my younger brother had craving for fast food and was suffered from diseases round the year. When his school introduced a well-designed nutrition program, he gradually changed his eating habits and now he is healthier than even me.
From what has been discussed above, we can conclude that nutrition education is the silver bullet to poor diet and its consequences. Therefore, school should have nutrition education program.

Some people think if students are afraid of the teacher it is better. Others say that having a friendly relation is better. What do you think?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Teachers are the persons who inspire students to strive for greatness. They can ignite pupils’ fullest potential. However, when it comes to the point of teacher behavior to students, educators are split in their opinion. Some educators contend that teachers should be hard, while others refute the notion and, argue that teachers should be amiable. In the stance, I am of the honest opinion that extremes of both treatments are not conducive for nurturing the talent of students. A perfect combination of the two would be far better than choosing one of them, I think.
For a start, strict behavior has several advantages. Teachers with their strict behavior can maintain discipline in a better manner. That is to say, when pupils are afraid of the teacher, they will less likely attend class regularly, and submit their homework or assignment on time. Most importantly, the teacher can control class effectively so that students cannot create mess in the classroom. In contrast, if students fear a teacher very much, they usually do not share the problems they face. The strict treatment, thus, may hamper the students’ development.
On the contrary, an amiable teacher can develop an effective collaborative relation between him and students. The students feel free asking any question they need to know. Consequently, the teachers can provide them solutions. In addition, students discuss with the friendly to clarify their concept about a topic, which by consequence fosters the creativity of the students. For example, in my school days, I always shared and discuss my problems with those teachers who were friendly and attained good grades in those teachers’ courses. However, those teachers often could not control classes efficiently as students, many a times, created mess in the class.
From the aforementioned argument, I would like to say that teacher should have a perfect proportion of friendliness and strictness, because, extreme of any may bring dire consequence to the students’ life. All that I want say that teachers should act according to the particular situation that when to be rude and when to be friend.

House is the basic need of man. Government should donate houses to needy people.
To what extent you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Hundreds of people are roaming around the city holding “I want to work for food” placard. Homeless shelters are at full capacity. Many people argue that the government should provide the country’s indigent with house. To my way of thinking, donating house alone does not curb this socio-economic problem effectively. The government has to address the root cause of the issue, and then should devise a workable solution.
To begin with, government should embark on a programme of housing. The programme will allow low-income households to build modest market-rate housing of their preference and grant a flexible subsidy that will be adjusted with the families’ income over the time. Another programme should be launched that will be approached to street homelessness. The programme will deal with the street homeless people; the majority of whom are living with substance abuse disorders, mental illness, and other severe health issues. Another key thing to bear in mind, these street homeless individuals should be moved directly into the subsidized housing, and then link them to support services.
Having said that, we have to address the root cause of this socio-economic problem in order to effectively curb the issue. If we delve into the issue, we find the causes are poverty and education. That is to say that poverty and education have a reciprocal relationship with homelessness. In fact, poverty and education cause the income disparity, which in turn contributes to the homelessness. So, the government should instigate a policy aimed to reduce poverty and mandatory secondary level education for all.
To wrap up, providing housing alone cannot deal with the homelessness effectively. The government has to adopt a policy so that the income disparity can be reduced and all citizens can get secondary level education.

Sport today is turning into a business, with many companies involved and ever growing prize money for the sportsmen. Do you think it’s a positive or negative development?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
As a capitalist society, commercialization has become prevalent in everywhere, whether it is in sports, politics, academics, or social activities. The incessant acceptance and prevalence of advertising activities in sports helps to normalize commercial intrusion in every domain of sports. The giant transnational companies are increasingly engage in the sports events and are even spending thousands of dollars on prize money. However, when it comes to the issue of whether it is positive trend or negative trend, people are split in their opinion. As far as I am concerned that it is a positive development.
First and foremost, commercialization of sports boosts revenue. Not only does it benefit to generating more capital for sports, but equally proliferates revenue for different industries. To give an illustration of what I mean, let us look at the case of National football League. The NFL and it thirty two teams raked $1.07 billion in sponsorship revenue in 2003 according to IEG. Likewise, electronic media and print media earned revenue from ads broadcasting events and presenting news.
Similarly, Commercialization of sports also improves amateur level sports into professional level. That is to say that when an amateur level sports are focused commercially, media exaggerates the events and eventually the event can transcend into professional level. In addition, the sponsorship and prize money uplift the living standard of players. Another key point to remember is commercialization fosters the number and quality of sports telecasted on TV. Without sponsorship, spectacles would not able to enjoy their favourite sports sitting home.
To sum up, commercialization is an inevitable phenomenon in sports today. It benefits enormously to sports and boosts economy as well. Therefore, I deem that commercialization of sports indeed a positive development.

Sample Answer:
Adolescence is the prime stage of human development. At this period, teenagers prepare themselves for the future. In this instance, voluntary work offers them a great opportunity to hone their several skills and they also contribute to the community at the same time. I am absolutely convinced that youngsters should involve in voluntary service since it will improve their personal traits and society as well.
Teenage volunteering is an excellent way to boost confident, self-esteem, and to build handy skills. Youngsters can learn how to deal with challenges, communicate various types of people, and develop their life skills in a supportive environment. My experience here is a good example. I was introvert and bereft of interpersonal skills. My parents asked me to involve in community activities and obeying their suggestion I involved in a community activity. It has changed my life magically. Now both individually and in a group, I can confidently communicate and interact with other people. Most importantly, being involved in some kind of unpaid work can also abate the prospect of substance abuse, mental illness, and juvenile crimes.
On the same token, teenagers, getting involved in community activities, contribute to the society substantially. They can engage in many activities like keeping environment clean, caring elderly, volunteering in a children hospital, and so on. Once I involved in a children hospital. I realize that a single day of volunteer work in hospital could have great effect on many lives. Even if you give a minute attention to an ill child could make a significant difference in the child’s life. It can firm the child’s trust and belief in other people and inspire him to do so. Society, thus, could be uplifted through unpaid work by teenagers.
All in all, unpaid works underpin every society. Youngsters, engaging unpaid works, can develop themselves and society can be benefited simultaneously.

Some practical skills such as money management should be taught in high school. 
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
A quality educational institution does not only indulge their students in curricular activities; rather they also focus to provide such facilities for student to groom their personality through extracurricular activities, learning life and self-help skill, like money management, conversation, thinking pattern, logical thinking, and basic expressions. All these skills help them in their career life, to make them successful person. I personally agree with the idea that money management is a skill or quality that high school students should be taught to become ideal citizens in the future.
First of all, the necessities of such life learning and self-help skills are important components of successful career life. Sometimes student study finance subjects but they do not understand how to fill out taxes forms, purchase automobiles or cell phones, and pay and read utility bills. There is a need to introduce them with complicated financial concept through practical man made situations e.g. demonstrations at schools. When a child learn the basic of money management, he can understand the sacrifices his parents are doing and can also become a prudent person in his life.  Conversation is another important skill for high school student to learn, because besides our daily routine life it also help them to build a good relationship between buyer and seller, if they are either playing a role of buyer or seller, good conversation skill helps them to gain the other person trust an loyalty which is adventitious for both. However, many basic and good qualities could be learned in high school and money management is one of the most important of such qualities.
Then, the thinking pattern of students plays a vital role in money management e.g. those students who just observe things on the surface level cannot overcome the ego-centrism and socio-centrism, as a result fail in their decision making and problem solving skills. Students should be taught to think critically to justify and reflect on their values and decisions, which will enhance their self-evaluation skills and help them to express their ideas systematically. To learn these critical skills the high schools students should be given the opportunity to learn money management.
Put everything in to consideration, money management is an important skill to run a successful professional and personal life, which makes them somehow independent in managing their economic affairs. More social, personal, and self-help skills should be taught at high schools to make them independent and good citizens.

In many countries there has been an increase in social problems involving teenagers in recent years. Many people believe that this is due to modern lifestyles because parents spend more and more time at work and have less time to supervise their children.
To what extent do you believe this is true?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
Modern lifestyle has changed many facets of life, particularly parenting. Parents are busy with their career and are no longer able to spend quality time in bringing up their offspring. Which by consequence, it has been seen that social issues pertaining to youngsters are being escalated lately in many countries.
To start with, increasing juvenile crime is a harsh reality in many societies. Teenagers are susceptible to the external influence, but the onus is on their parents to guide them in order to keep them on the right track. Without any shred of doubt, parents are the role model and emissary of light for the children. But regrettably, modern lifestyle refrains parents to accomplish their core duty of parenting. Due to the cut-throat competition and financial solvency for leading cozy life, both the parents engage in job, even in multifaceted career and work long hours. Consequently, parents considerably fail to provide the youngsters with moral education. As a result, teenagers often cannot discern the proper path of life.
On the same token, adolescents, absence of parents, can enjoy freedom of what they want to. And with the multitude opportunity of spending time, teenagers very often are exposed with many anti-social activities by bad companions. They even could involve in local gangs and can commit ruthless crimes. Moreover, parents’ absence can lead them into gloomy state. Thereby, teenagers may become addicted to psychoactive substances. They start using these drugs to alter their mood. This could result in many psychological disorders. In addition, youngsters may surf porn sites in absence of their parents that can cause moral degradation. This by consequence can lead them to committing sexual harassment.
All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume that all these behaviour of the adolescent stems from family context. In the consumer culture of modern epoch, parents are only pay attention to providing material necessities of their children. To do so, they involve in job, even in multifaceted career in order to keep their children happy materially and do not spend quality time on rearing them as a good citizen. Therefore, youngsters involve in many antisocial activities day by day.
Sample Answer 2:
Adolescence is a time period when physical, emotional, and behavioral changes occur. The adolescents due to these pubertal changes, suffers from emotional behavioral problems like identity crises, low self-esteem, anxiety, somatic complaints and phobias. At this stage the children suffers from identity crisis because of the double standards made by parents and society. I believe that parents’ lack of attention to their children due to the time they spend at work is an influential reason for teenage social problems.
The adolescent is a stage, which is very crucial to develop personality and identity of the child. As a child reaches to this stage of life, he comes across with the sudden and rapid changes in body and mind, which cause emotional disturbance. The child put his efforts to come out from theses emotional disturbances but the parents have a great role to play. If an adolescent behaves like a child he is criticized by his parents as, do not behave like a child, you are not a kid anymore. On the other hand if he behaves like an adult he is again criticized by them as, not take interest in adult’s stuff or do not interfere in decision making matters, go and play outside. These double standards confuse them to develop a proper identity. Parents these days are quite busy outside and keep their children to either grandparents or to a baby-sitter. This has a very negative consequence to a child’s psychology and the bond between the parents and children thus becomes weak.
These social problem faced by the child are made by modern life style as media played a vital role to make a so called life standards and the youth is mad to follow them. The parent-child relationship now a day is totally a learned behavior- parents have adopted modernization to deal their children by giving them space and money but do not spend quality time together, and the children also want freedom from their parents, their role models, and inspiration, are determined by the media.
However in the long run of modern life style, it is a healthy competition among societies, but it can cause alarming destruction in future for teenager as they are totally being ignored by their parents. There is need to psycho-educate parents that how does quality of time can control many issue in parent child relationships.

Governments give a lot of support to artists, even though some people think it is a waste of money that could have been used elsewhere.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Art is a phenomenon that ennobles the human race. Many people contend that governments should support the artists in their efforts to raise standards. But, others seem the funding the artists is worth nothing raising the question about whether the artists should receive fund when the myriad other needs are pressing. In the instance, I am of the honest opinion that governments ought to invest money in other essential sectors, such as education or health care, instead.
For a start, the artists play a vital role in keeping the society vibrant. They are the person who help the individuals maintain a sound physical, mental, and emotional health, contributing the well-being and aiding recovery process, which in turn makes a vibrant community. In addition, the artists, through their arts, innovate and create unique products and services. Which by consequence helps gain the competitive edge in the global market. The artists, therefore, can bring forth the tremendous economic fortune. For the reason, the proponents of the artists argue that the government should lend its support to them.
On the other hand, most countries struggle with a tight budget and suffer severe budget cuts. These nations should spend every public penny carefully. They should prioritize the sectors like, education and health care. This is because, education and health care are the two of the basic rights of every citizen regardless of economic condition. Besides, these two sectors ensure that there are healthy and skill workforce making contribution to the nation. The governments, therefore, should spend a substantial sums of money on health care and education rather than spending on the artists.
To wrap up, governments today are wrestling with severe economic crisis. So, the government ought to allocate budget to the most crucial sectors in a time of great austerity. That is why, I think that the governments should not spend a significant portion of its budget on the artists.

Some say that due to heavy traffic governments need to build more roads in metropolitan cities, while others argue this isn’t the right solution. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Traffic congestion is the most common scenario in metropolitan cities across the world. In many circles, it is argued that government should build more roads and highways in order to curb the pressing issue, while others refute the concept. However, as far as I think building new roads is not a pragmatic solution to the problem and the governments ought to some other measures to combat against the traffic gridlock.
For a start, building new roads is not at all a sensible idea as the most cities have great scarcity of space to construct more roads. Every day hundreds of people come to the cities for several reasons. Thereby, the density of population is increasing day by day. This overpopulation significantly contributes to the shortage of lands for building new roads. Building new roads, thus, is an absurd idea at this current situation.
In contrast, there are other handy steps like encouraging public transport, enforcing traffic laws strictly, and so on. Due to economic solvency, city dwellers tend to have private vehicles for commuting. Consequently, the increasing number of private cars puts pressure on roads that results in traffic jam in the urban areas. In the case, encouraging public transport would be the silver bullet to fight against the traffic congestion. This is because the more and more people will ride public transport, the less and less pressure will be put on the roads. However, another prime cause of traffic jam is neglecting traffic rules. If the traffic rules are imposed strictly, then traffic congestion could be quelled dramatically.
To reiterate, addressing the root causes of a problem can resolve the problem to a great extent. Here, excessive private cars and disobeying the traffic laws are the main cause of traffic jam. Therefore, the government should motivate citizens to use public transport and obey the traffic rules in order to calm the traffic congestion in metropolitan cities.

With the increasing number of people in cities, most do not know their neighbours and the sense of community is lost. What is causing this? How can we turn it around?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

Model Essay:
Global capitalism fueled by industry has caused radical social change. Conventional assumptions about the nature of society are no longer valid. People are moving from countryside, where they worked as peasant, into the cities as they sight new economic opportunities generated by the boom in industry and its subsequent need for labour. Consequently, cities are becoming densely populated. Although this change has uplifted the quality of life for most city dwellers, unfortunately they are losing their sense of community.
As people move to cities, the sense of communities is lost little by little. People tend to become more and more individualized and dependent only upon themselves in order for their livelihood rather than seeking to foster the entire community. Individuals in cities want to entertain their own interests and needs. In cities, individuals associate with each other not because they feel the deep sense of community but rather because the other person poses something that the individual considers as satisfying a particular immediate need. City, thus, forms a mechanical society weakening close, long-lasting primary knits in favour of superficial secondary relationships.
However, as far as I believe that religion would be a handy tool to hone the sense of community. Most religions on the earth have some kind of forms of practicing community. For example, “umma” or community is the cornerstone of Islam, the communion of saints in Christianity is a form of community, and community is a distinguished notion in Judaism. Religion teaches us being human is not only about being an individual, but also it is about belonging to the community. Thereby, religiously active women and men are very often more sensitive to others, more likely to be helpful without desiring material gain, and more likely to serve those in need.
All in all, increasingly number of people are leaving countryside to city and the city is become heavily populated. But ironically, the people become fully assimilated into the melting pot of the urban mechanical society and they lose their ties with each other. But there is still hope and the deep sense of community can be retained if we practice the religious principles of community.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Stress is an unavoidable part of modern epoch where lives could be at stake any time. Stress is very subjective problem. Some people reads novels, some exercise, others work in their gardens in order to curb stress. However, I feel that music and meditation can put stress at bay.
For a start, listening to music is an excellent way in order for calming stress. In most cases, people have favourite list of music they like to enjoy at certain times, particularly when they are in good mood or in gloomy condition. Musical has a magical power to induce mood. So, it is better to make a list of music that helps relax the stress and anxiety. For example, whenever I feel stress, I take some of my favourite music to a quiet place where I sit for half an hour and concentrate on the music. Astonishingly, the music melts away all my stresses and anxieties. Besides, there are different types of music on the market that claim to be effective in stress. Therefore, people have several types of music to fight against stress.
In addition, meditation is another handy technique to quell stress. A few minutes is spent on meditation each day can help ease stress. Many studies reveal that daily meditation can alter the brain’s neural pathways, making people more pliable to stress. Similarly, deep breath is also a way of escaping the anxiety and stress of modern life. Deep breathing counters the impacts of stress by lowering the blood pressure and slowing the hearth rate.
To wrap up, people approach several ways to combat against stress of modern life. Although stress is subjective in nature, music and meditation are the best ways of relieving stress.

Today world has some urgent problems and solving them is possible only by nations’ cooperation.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Our planet has transformed into a global village. There are several pressing issues like climate change, terrorism that cross the national boundary to international arena and one nation alone cannot combat against these grave problems. Thereby, nations should work jointly in order to curb these problems.
To start with, climate change can lead the earth to the brink of disaster. Rapid industrialization, carbon emission, deforestation cause the climate change, and it is such an issue that could be mitigated only by collective approach. All nations have to develop a single framework so that we can improve the environmental issues substantially. As one nation may cause great harm to environment, all nations should reach to a consensus about some points. Nations have to set a collective strategy to limit carbon emissions, conserve forest and wildlife, and so on.
Similarly, terrorism is another lethal problem can be quelled only by the collective measure of all nations. While terrorism is mostly intercontinental, the root causes of terrorism lie in national factors such as social, religious, political, and ideological and so all nations should work under a single counter terrorism program. Why collective measure is needed is because individual nation can worsen the situation rather than calm. For instance, U.S government begins war on terror and staged a military invasion of Iraq led to enormous bloodshed that not only escalate terrorism in the country, but also affects the entire region.
All in all, the next couple of decades is very crucial for our planet. How global urgent issues will be solved over these years will determine the fate of the earth for our subsequent generations. Therefore, all nations should devise a single strategy in order to fight against these fatal problems effectively.

Levels of youth crime are increasing rapidly in most cities around the world. What are the reasons for this, and suggest some solutions.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Nowadays, the rates of Juvenile crime are escalating dramatically in most cities across the globe. The phenomenon is very alarming as it impacts on most aspects of city life. The reason behind the increase in juvenile delinquency along with remedial actions to quell the situation will be discussed in the following.
There are several reasons lie in the scenario. First of all, youngsters in cities are likely more independent and revolutionary against traditional beliefs and values than their counterpart of countryside. They, very often, are reluctant to obey the advices of elder generation. Both the traditional principles and elders’ advices are very good at self-cultivating. There is, therefore, the youngsters who discard the traditional values tend commit delinquency. Secondly, the busy modern life is another culprit contributing juvenile delinquency. In the cities, most parents are busy with their career and they cannot spend quality time on parenting. Consequently, children of these busy feel themselves as neglected and contact with bad peers who have already involved in law-breaking, violence, gangs, drugs, and so on. Last but not the least; usually youngsters have low self-control that they cannot control their impulsion. Thereby, they have poor ability to think before acting.
However, in several ways, youngsters can be refrained from committing crimes. Firstly, we should incorporate traditional principles and moral lessons in syllabus so that can attain noble traits. Secondly, parents can paramount role to curb the alarming situation as their guidance is key factor in self-cultivation. Therefore, parents should spend sufficient time in order to teach ethics and to smooth relation between parents and children so that children can feel free to share their complexities.
To wrap up, youngsters who live in the cities tend to commit crimes. Formal education and parents can contribute to improve the situation substantially, I believe.

Only formal examinations, written or practical, can give a clear picture of students’ true knowledge and ability at university level. Continuous assessment like course work and projects are poor measures of students’ ability.
How far do agree with this latter statement?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Essay:
Assessment and its associated feedback have enormous importance in student learning. Formal examination and continuous assessment are the two most prevalent approach of assessment around the world. However, in many circles, it is contend that formal examinations, whether it is written or practical, offer the true representation of students’ actual ability and knowledge at tertiary level. They believe that continuous assessment, for example course work and assignments, is poor yardstick to measure a student’s ability and competence. But, I do not deem one-size-fits all approach. Continuous assessment has multitude benefits which are critical to learning objective.
One of the expected benefits of continuous assessment is its guidance oriented nature. That is to say that it involves gathering data over a period of time that allows the approach to provide teachers with more accurate data early enough to modify instruction. This sheds light on students’ weakness comprehensively that allows teachers to remediate students’ weak points. Similarly, since assessments are embedded in the flow of learning process, students can get a stream of opportunities to correct themselves and show their mastery.
Another benefit of continuous assessment is the decisive lecturers’ role. When lecturer holds scheduled classes for a prescribed period of time, the instruction runs at lecturer’s pace. Lecturers can make their pace according to students’ ability. Continuous assessment changes the lecturers’ role from “sage on the stage” to “guide on side”. Lecturers work with pupils as guiding learning, solving problems, and aiding synthesize and exert knowledge.
To sum up, students are needed to prove their mastery in many areas at university level. Therefore, all I want to say that continuous assessment is as critical as formal examination.

Model Essay:
We live in a society where people tend to display fake show off. Many product providers wrap their products with attractive packet. They contend that the goods and its performance is less significant than the package look like. Actually, they discern that the product packaging plays a paramount role in the failure or success of the sales of products. But the amount of packaging has devastating consequence on environment. So, we should reduce the amount of packaging. To do so, I think both the product providers and the consumers’ joint efforts are needed.
Packaging is prevalent everywhere and everything is wrapped we buy. Every year packaging waste increases along with the increase in consumption. The excessive packaging has disastrous impact on environment including the loss of precious resources like energy and water. In the case, the product providers can play a vital role. They can make sure which products need packaging and what size is appropriate as very often providers tend to wrap everything and sometimes even big package in order to attract intended customers. They can make package with only relevant information without pompous presentation.
Likewise, consumers also have the responsibility in reducing packaging to contribute to better environment. Where possible, they can buy the least packaged product. That is to say that they can avoid buying products those come wrapped in large package without necessity. In addition to this, consumers can buy products in bulk so that the products can be packed in a single package.
To recapitulate, the amount of packaging of goods causes harms to environment and it is also wasting of resources. So, we ought to reduce the amount of packaging of products as possible as we could. In the instance, both the consumers and the providers have to take part in reducing the amount of packaging.

Model Essay:
Nowadays, many a people rely on computers and gadgets for reading information. Thereby, many circles suggest that there is no need to print books, newspapers and magazines on paper. In the case, I completely disagree with the statement and believe that printed books, magazines and newspapers would not be obsolete. The following reasons could explain why?
To begin with, the printed book has some significant benefits over digital version. First of all, it is easier to skim, to relate a point, and we comfortably go back and forth in. Most importantly, it is quite easier to underline important sentences or paragraphs and to take notes in the margins. In addition to this, reading digital version of books very often seems stressful and has some side effects on health. Which by consequence, people who are comfortable with electronic devices to read book prefer printed books for serious study. Take my experience as an example. When I engage in prolong reading on my laptop, I always feel headaches. This obviously demonstrates that printed books would be read by many people in coming future.
Similarly, despite the rise of reading on electronic devices, still majority portion of readers has a predilection for printed magazines and newspapers. A survey conducted by Deloitte reveals that 80% of magazine readers still prefer to read articles via print. However, one might be able to look at a digital magazine on smart phone, but he cannot cut things out, colour in, and stick it to the wall. Even the tech-savvy generation loves to do these things. Actually, physical forms of written words always give a lucid and different exciting experience. So, the printed magazine or newspaper will not be expired due its own unique appeals.
From what has been discussed above, it could be clearly say that the “death of print” is greatly exaggerated. I contend that printed books, newspapers and magazine will survive for its own right.

In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive.
To what extent do you agree with this view?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
It goes without saying that the information technology reaches in the verge of excellence over the last couple of decades. The World Wide Web and email are the two stunning and intangible epitomes of the development and these innovations have uplifted our everyday life to a great extent. Nonetheless, some people feel anxious with its consistent development. As far as I am concerned the negative impacts cannot outweigh its benefits.
For a start, a considerable concern about both public and private sphere has been loomed large with incessant development in information technology. This will substantially decrease the cost of information processing and data storage in the near future. This by consequence, the detailed dossier on citizen will likely be gathered by both the government agencies and private data-mining companies in stealth. No one knows who would collect data about individuals, how these information will be used, shared or misused. It might lead to disastrous consequence.
In contrast, future developments in information technology will have many potential advantages to society. It would offer us new handy tools, new opportunities. Take crime and terrorists detection for example. In future, law enforcement agencies could more efficiently detect crime even before it takes place with the foster of information technology. In addition, the development of IT may also find the solution of the increasingly energy demand. That is to say, information technology may contribute to space research significantly and we may find alternative energy resources on the other parts of the universe. It may also contribute to the improvement in agriculture and climate change drastically.
In fine, information technology is a double-edge sword. But I believe that its potential advantages will eclipse the drawbacks.


Some people think that government should invest money to study life on other planets, while others say that it is waste spending money on such things when earth itself has lot of problems.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Sample Essay:
Every year many opulent nations across the globe spend billions of dollars on searching extra-terrestrial life. Many people chime with the idea that the governments should invest extravagantly to learn life on the planet. This provokes ire of conservatives who deem that it is completely wastage of money and this budget can be allocated to solve the dire problems on earth. In this stance, I do not believe that there is one-size fits all answers.
It goes without saying that there are enormous pressing issues like food crisis, climate change, poverty etc. around the world which need substantial attention. Each day hundreds of children die from hunger and malnutrition. A recent study shows that an African child dies of hunger in every thirty seconds. Similarly, climate change leads us to a fatal condition day by day. Climate change results in global warming, drought, sea level increase, and so on. In addition to this, we have to combat against AIDS which is largely considered as a disease of poverty. Therefore, affluent countries ought to make budget to eradicate these grave issues.
Having said that, however, many a people oppose the former argument. They claim that searching extra-terrestrial life could bring boon to mankind. Searching for life on the other planets could be the way of answering mysterious issues about ourselves. Where did human being come from? Why is human being here? Moreover, if we find any life in the other parts of the universe, we then may learn from them many things and may be find the way out of our current pressing problems like, climate change, overpopulation, and so forth. There are also advantages that may be cannot predict ahead of time.
All in all, although we have to have priority in our grim problems on earth, research on searching for extra-terrestrial life should be carried out and got sufficient budget. This could bring us enormous benefits in future which may be beyond our imagination now.

Model Essay:
It goes without saying that professional sports are increasingly being popular due to its commercialization. Athletes and the sports they represent enjoy a great financial support and enormous media publicity. This trend impacts severely on the sponsorship to serious cultural events like music, art, and theatre. The declination of sponsorship to cultural activities shallows our society to a great extent.
There is no denying fact that sponsorship and commercialism have made sports a lucrative industry. The transnational companies are splurging sky-high amount in order to advertise or to sponsor athletes as their ambassador. Thereby, youngsters and their parents tend to inclined to professional sports. Parents devote their time and money in order to raise their children as an athlete. Most times, parents and children are indifferent to cultural activities. For example, in many a society it is very difficult to get viewers for theatre, where rugby stadiums are crowded with cheering spectators. Cultural activities, thus, are neglected by a considerable portion of society.
In addition, cultural events or activities firm the bond of society. Actually, cultural activities enlighten the dwellers of a society and thus enrich the society. A society consists several groups of people and each group may possess different perspective. Through cultural events or activities, these different groups get a platform to interact among themselves and to share their views with each other. This deepens the relationship between people in a given society.
In a nutshell, when one thing is overemphasize, then indeed the other one is neglected that causes imbalance in the society. We need everything in a well-balanced proportion in order to well-being of the society.

Most education systems rely on examinations to encourage children to study, but as a result, children suffer from too much stress and they never learn to be creative. Therefore, exams should be abolished.
To what extend do you agree or disagree?
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Examination, whether it is formal or continual assessment, is the integral part of our education system. However, we live in a world of cut-throat competition where exams are highly valued as it is seemed to determine the path of success in life and failure is not an option. Consequently, it is quite natural for children who prepare themselves for exams to be under pressure. Actually exam-oriented education system does not at all encourage pupils rather they suffer from too much anxiety and they cannot hone their creative skills. Therefore, exams should be discarded from the education system.
First of all, children, in most cases, are bogged down due to the pressure of expectations from their parents. Many a parents want to fulfill their dreams through their children and in the process they unfortunately fail to realize that they are exerting an undue pressure on their children’s minds at a very tender age. Children are asked to attain good grades at any cost. As a result, they are stressed with exams. On the top of that, there is another type of pressure where parents consistently compare their children’s grades with those of their peers. Although a healthy competition always encourages pupils to excel, but the practice of comparing grades very often builds up tremendous pressure that leads to stress in children.
Again, in a solely exam-oriented education system, children tend to invest a great deal of time in studies in order to get a good grade in exams. In the process, they sacrifice their golden childhood mixing around with their peers. This refrains themselves from honing several social skills. In addition to this, when the goal is to attain higher grades in exams, other activities will likely to be sacrificed. Parents and teachers shrink extra-curricular activities like sports and discourage creative activities so that they can spend more time on studies. This is how they not only polish their creative competence, but also are deprived from such activities seemed as the outlet to release stress.
In conclusion, in the light of what is discussed above we can easily conclude that in reality exam-oriented education system does not inspire children to study. Moreover, it causes a lot of stress in children’s mind at very early stage and is the major obstacle of obtaining creative skills. Therefore, I would like to say that we should abolish exams at least in primary levels.


It is better to grow up with siblings than without. Do you agree or disagree?
Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.
Model Answer:
There is not a denying fact that sibling bond is precious for all. However, some people think that it is better to grow up with siblings than without, while others oppose the notion. In this instance, I am of the honest opinion that it is far better to grow up with brothers and sisters than to be an only child. The following reasons could explain why.
First and foremost, children who grow up with siblings are physically and mentally healthy. For instance, there is a plenty of literature revealing that siblings help increase energy expenditure as they play and run around a lot. According to BBC News, siblings are actually helping each other reduce obesity and foster their mental health. As regards the mental health, children who connect their sister and brother and go through life together are adroit to tackle some difficult situations with ease than those without siblings, BBC reported.
Likewise, siblings can learn from each other, and even the play time. A very good example here is my experience. I bring up with siblings and my brothers taught me how to count, write with chalk and to interact in the very much same way that the teachers taught me in classrooms. Not only that when we played together, my elder brother and sister taught me how to solve problems and several conquer issues which are invaluable lesson for me.
Last but not the least, people who are brought up with siblings are less likely to get divorced. That is because they handle their brothers and sisters are more likely to understand how to best handle a marriage and are able to avoid divorce. Children who have siblings have a better knowledge of how to deal with others and social situations that help them when it comes to sustaining relationships as they get older as claimed by a study cited by The Columbus Dispatch. So, this reveals that they are more apt to handle their conjugal life and eventually can avoid divorce.
All in all, sibling relationship has great impact in our young and adult lives as the relationship shape our characters to a far greater extent. Siblings are not merely second edition in relation to the parents, but have a severe importance in their own right.

A long distance flight consumes as much fuel as a car consumes in several years time, and causes the same amount of pollution as cars. So some people think we should abandon non essential flights (such as for tourism), and it is more efficient than restricting the car. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Environmental pollution is the most pressing problem of the planet right now. In many circles, it is argued that the long distance flight exhausts the same amount of fuel as compared to a car in several years time. That is why, they blame flights and suggest that it is a good way to control pollution is to discard non-essential flights, for example tour flights rather than limiting cars. While their comparison is quite right, but I do not think the solution is pragmatic. If it is about controlling pollution, then we have better solutions rather than restricting non-essential flights.
Both transport types, airplane and car, consume fossil fuels. When fossil fuels are burnt, they emit nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. This airborne nitrogen causes harms to environment. However, there are several ways to curb the environmental pollution. I think sustainable alternative jet fuels could help quell the pollution. Their use could lessen the emission of nitrogen into the atmosphere that contributes to global warming. We have to develop alternative fuels in order to address the environmental issues. Take ALFA-BIRD for an example. It is investigating new approaches and new alternative fuels for aircraft.
However, the suggestion of discarding flights, such as for tourism, does not sound pragmatic at all regarding economy and development. This is because the trade and commerce has expanded throughout the world and it is interlinked beyond the geographical boundary due to globalization. As a result, the frequency of flights is increasing considerably that boosts the economy. So, abandoning or restricting flights mean shrinking economy. Again, tourism is not a luxury now. In the contemporary society, people are working astonishingly more hours than ever before. So, they are exhausted terribly and they need tour to recharge themselves. In addition to this, tourism provides a big boost to the GDP (Gross Domestic Production) and also creates employment opportunity to a great extent. Thus, tourism is a handy tool to calm the curse of poverty.
To reiterate, we cannot cut off our head due to headache. Likewise, we cannot reduce the amount of flights or cars in order to tackle environmental pollution. History evidences that it is human being who always devise new approaches to meet challenges. I believe that we indeed will be able to develop alternative jet fuels. Therefore, there is no need to make an impractical step like abandoning non-essential flights.

The percentage of overweight children in western society has increased by almost 20% in the last ten years.
Discuss the causes and effects of this disturbing trend.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
In the past ten years, we have seen an escalating trend in the rate of childhood obesity in the western society. The terrifying fact is that it has increased by almost 20% in the last decade. In many circles, it is considered as an epidemic. Several reasons, such as fast food instead of healthy meals and modern lifestyle could be attributes as the causes for this problem. However, childhood obesity may have several complications for child’s physical, emotional, and social well-being.
In general, the overall lifestyle causes the childhood obesity. Today in the western world, children lead a different lifestyle than ever before. They uses car and bus ride instead of walking to and from school. In the most cases, after school sports and gym have been discarded and children spend their afternoons by watching TV, playing video games or surfing Internet. On the top of that, parents are now terribly busier than ever before and they have almost no time for preparing meals. Consequently, children eat fewer home-cooked meals. So, they are deprived of well-balanced diet and very often there is no vegetable on the plate. Actually, in western society children rely on junk foods which cause obesity to a great extent. Modern lifestyle, thus, hindrances the burning of calories on the one hand and deposits more calories from junk or rich foods on the other hand.
However, childhood obesity is causing a broad of health issues. These include type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, high cholesterol and high blood pressure, asthma, early puberty or menstruation, sleep disorders and so forth. There are also social and emotional complications. Obese children are more susceptible to low self-esteem and bullying, behavior and learning problems, depression, etc.
To wrap up, in western world, children are likely to be obese because of their lifestyle. Obesity causes several severe diseases. We have to curb the obesity problem in order to get a healthier nation. That is why we need small but permanent changes in our eating habits and physical activities.

As people live longer and longer, the idea of cloning human beings in order to provide spare parts is becoming a reality. The idea horrifies most people, yet it is no longer mere science fiction.
To what extent do you agree with such a procedure?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Human cloning is the most sensitive and controversial issue in modern science. However, in many circles, it is argued that cloning would be a boon to human civilization in order for transplanting organs as people’s lifespan expanded. Advocates of human cloning even contend that it is more a science fiction. Yet, the empirical evidences demonstrate that it is more fiction than reality. I oppose wholeheartedly the procedure for several reasons. The reasons are discussed in the following.
To start with, the process of cloning, technically and scientifically, translates into genetical copy an organism and creates a “carbon copy” that has same DNA. Over the past few decades, many experiments have failed. Actually, there are very sparse examples in the success rate. Since the birth of the cloned sheep Dolly, several reproductive scientists, like Severino Antinori, Panayiotis Michael Zavos, and Brigitte Boisselier, have declared that they were ready to clone human beings. Scientists cloned various mammals have revealed many technical problems. Most clones die soon after birth or during gestation. In addition to this, the surviving clones are plagued with severe genetic and physiological problems. Therefore, in human cloning, the subtle failure in genomic reprogramming may lead to devastating consequences.
Again, if human cloning is succeeded, then the ethical question will be raised. This is because the cloned human has as same mental and emotional sensation as human beings. So, have all the rights a man should have. He should enjoy equal rights as a human that no one can snatch away his rights and hence, organ transplanting is beyond the imagination. If human does this, it indeed would be stark inhuman. So, human cloning should be prohibited at once.
In fine, animating life is the most mystic power of God. I believe that it is beyond human capacity or wisdom. So, the minute mistake can cause curse to mankind. That is why, human cloning must be discarded.

Currently there is a trend towards the use of alternative forms of medicine. However, at best these methods are ineffective, and at worst they may be dangerous.
To what extent do you agree with this statement?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Essay :
The term “alternative medicine”, in common parlance this refers to any health treatment not standard in modern medical practices. Beyond that, the alternative forms of medicine are very difficult to define as it is diverse largely. It includes the practices spanning exercise and diet, chiropractic adjustment, hypnosis, poking needles into one’s skin, and so on. Nowadays more and more people tend to lean on alternative medicine instead of conventional treatments. Some people, however, doubt its efficacy and contend that it is ineffective or dangerous at its worst part. In this instance, I firmly believe that it is not yet the time to doubt about the efficacy of alternative therapies, since many empirical evidences testify its success.
To begin with, the alternative forms of medicine have a rationale. While conventional medicine uses chemical compounds, the alternative medicines use herb, extracts, and even metal. Their success depends on how safely and appropriately these compounds are handled. For instance, at times asthmatic children are cured by steroid inhalers. Now many a children turn into natural treatments. Analyzing these medications, it is seen that they also contain steroids have sources from plant kingdom.
Similarly, acupressure also has rationale. The theory behind acupressure is that meridians are channels that circulate life energy throughout the body. The rationale holds that illness may occur when one of these meridians are clogged up; acupressure can streamline the blockage so that the energy can flow in normal pace restoring wellness.
Likewise, aromatherapies are becoming popular day by day. It uses essential oils extracted from leaves, seeds, roots, or blossoms of plants to promote healing. Many studies reveal that aromatherapy might calm anxiety, depression, and reduce pain.
Based on above discussion, it is not yet come to the point that the alternative medicine has little or no efficacy or in some cases, it is dangerous. I think alternative medicine might turn helplessness into hope. What I like to say is that many researches should be conducted to determine its uses and benefits.

Governments often spend large sums of money on spectacular displays to celebrate national events of significance. This money could be better spent on improving social conditions in the country.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Essay:
Every country around the globe has its national events, for example Independence Day, an Armed Forces Day and so on. The governments tend to splurge sky-high money in these events in order to show their national pride and heritage. They organize a raft of events to make the day an especially festive one. They organize military parade, dancing, firework display, and decorate all the streets and hang spectacular billboards to celebrate and demonstrate the significance of the day. However, some people outcry that it is completely wasteful. In my opinion, spending on these days costs more than the benefits they create.
To start with, most countries celebrate their independence day as national day. It is usually commemorated in a celebratory fashion. The governments solemnize the day with pomp and parade, with dazzling fireworks are accompanied by sound and light show. The governments spend millions of dollar to celebrate the values that the countries were founded upon. The governments organize these expensive programs in order to show their support for the heritage, history and citizen of the nations. However, these spendthrift programs do not retain values or patriotism to a significant extent. So, spending millions of dollar is completely wasteful, I think.
Rather, the government ought to spend the money on the welfare of the nation. Instead of wasting money on these fake shows off programs, the governments should spend money to boost socio-economic condition of the nations, because, a nation can enjoy an admirable position in the world through its socio-economic status. Even, I think that the affluent nations ought to cut off billions of dollars in order to help poverty-stricken nations so that they can uplift their socio-economic condition.
All in all, I do not ignore the significance of national day. All I want to say is that we must celebrate these days but in a simple manner so that we can use the money in welfare of our nation.

Nowadays more and more fathers look after their children at home, while mothers are doing full time work. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative development?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
In this age of apparent equality, women are encouraged to utilize the full opportunities, particularly balancing career in order to be deemed as successful. This results in increase of working mother. Consequently, it becomes very common scenario that increasingly numbers of fathers rear their children staying at home, whereas mothers involve in full time job. Despite some benefits, I believe that this would lead to dire consequences.
For a start, gender equality and social outlook foster this trend. Gender equality offers woman umpteen opportunities so that they can flourish themselves into every aspect of their life. Utilizing these opportunities, women are able to extend their academic and social prospect. Thereby, women step into the realm of job which once was beyond their imagination. They demonstrate their caliber, and even many a time they outrival their male counterpart are paid higher salaries, eventually. Besides, social perspective has change significantly in the modern contemporary society. In the past, earning for family was the prerogative right for male member only, but now couples decide who to work and who to stay at home.
However, to my way of thinking, fathers stay at home and cradle their children is a better option while mothers are biologically more capable in bringing up children. There are many distinct traits grounded in some biological instinct. Women’s biological pattern helps them respond more strongly to a child’s different expressions than their male counterpart. For example, my wife is always better than me at perceiving my daughter’s cry that now she cries for milk or for something else.
Besides, mother-child bond is utterly important and primary force in child development and is become strong by incessant interaction. Mother-child dyad, like the biology-environment interplay, is a reciprocal system in which mother tunes her child’s responds and internal state, which causes a response in the mother that further fuels the procedure. This means each has an intense influence on the next response and this dyad is the key to the healthy development for a child.
In fine, there is no denying fact that child rearing is the core responsibility for a mother. Therefore, a mother should not compromise this duty.

Formal examinations are the only effective way to assess a student’s performance. Continual assessment such as coursework and projects is not a satisfactory way to do this.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

Sample Essay: 
In modern education system, students are assessed in various ways including formal examinations and continual assessment like coursework and projects or assignments. Some people contend that formal examinations are the only effective approach to evaluate the strength of students. They argue that continual assessments are not satisfactory so as to formal examinations. In this stance, I do not believe that there is one approach cover all sides. The combination of both the formal examinations and continual assessment are essential to assess a student’s performance.
To start with, formal exams are introduced in order for teachers to see whether pupils really learn something from the lessons and the course as a whole. In doing so, students can be able to find their strength and weakness. In addition to this, formal exams are also beneficial for teachers as they can clearly see which student excels and those who need intense caring. However, it examines only the memorizing ability of a student, not his creativity. On the top of that, students often get nervous when they take part in an important exam. For example, one of my brilliant friends always performs badly in formal exams due to his nervousness.
On the flip side, continual assessment is a method in which students are assessed continuously over a period of time. Continuous assessment includes several types such as daily class work, course pertaining to projects and papers, and practical tasks. It has tremendous impact on pupils. Students get a constant stream of opportunity to excel themselves when assessment is continued. That is to say that assessment becomes embedded into the stream of learning. This results in that students is able to demonstrate their mastery as promptly as they choose to. Pupils’ lives become increasingly oriented towards real learning. On the other hand, there may have some malpractices in continuous assessment. Students may copy their projects or assignment from the Internet or other sources. For example, my elder brother very often copied his assignments from the Internet.
In fine, formal exams examine only the rote memory of a student whereas continuous assessment tests the students’ ability and overall competence in more natural way. In the case, I would like to say that the methods are not complement to each other since both the approaches have some drawbacks. Actually, the combination of formal exam and continuous assessment can meet the objective of assessment of a student.

In some countries old age is highly valued, while in others youth is emphasized.
Which viewpoint do you agree with?
You should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support arguments with example and relevant evidence.
You should write at least 250 words.

Model Answer:
Aging is not merely a biological process, but at the same time it is a cultural issue of many nations. Different nations have different cultures and their attitudes and practices around aging and death are different. The culture of many countries celebrates the aging process and reveres the elders, while youth is fetishized and old people are usually discarded from the society and relegated to old homes or retirement homes in many western countries. However, I am of the honest opinion that we should venerate our elders. The following reasons could explain why.
Elders should be revered because of their highly specialized competence and wisdom. Hawaiian grandmothers are very good example here. They are venerated for their unique knowledge and skills at creating ornate leis and feather accessories. The older people can pass down their knowledge and wisdom to young generation which is invaluable for us. So, we have to respect our elders for their wisdom and life experiences.
Similarly, older people deserve respect and value as they are increasingly handy as grandparents for high-quality childcare to their grandchildren. In the contemporary society, most young mothers enter workforce and they have no choice but relying on babysitters or day care centres. In the case, grandparents offers superior, motivated and experienced child care since they have already gained valuable experience from raising their own children. Actually, grandparents usually love their grandchildren very much and are eager to spend their time with them. So, if there is one reason is enough for the reverence of the older people, then it is the child care that the grandparents offer to their grandchildren.
To recapitulate, older people should not be neglected, because they are our parents, grandparents. Once they have raised us with great care and now it is our duty to revere them, to make room in the community for them. This does not mean that I do not want to underestimate youth. What I want to say is that we need to emphasize youth but not at the cost of veneration of the older people.

In countries such as Japan, the population is getting older. Are the effects of an ageing population positive or negative?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
A quiet but impertinent ticking is being heard from the demographic time bomb that sits beneath the many industrial countries, like Japan. That is to say that the population is getting older day by day. In many circles, it is believed that these aged people have many negative implications. However, I contend that there is a flip side of this situation that outweighs the drawbacks.
First of all, no one wants to say good bye to the earth and he wants to live as long as he could. The Pew Research Center’s Religion & Public Life Project asked more than 2,000 U.S adults about their desire to live longer as well as their crave for enhance life expectancy and medical services. 56% respondents said that they are not willing to undergo medical treatment to slow the aging process and live to 120 or beyond. Although two-thirds (68%) believed that most other people would. This means that most people expect to live longer. So, the massive benefit is that people are living longer, and relishing fuller, healthier lives.
Secondly, we can make room for the older people to work longer. They can then utilize their experience and wisdom in contributing the society. They can do voluntary in schools and for charities that is import for community. Most importantly, grandparents can play a vital role in raising their grandchildren. This is not only benefits the family regarding economics as the cost of child care soars, but also this can unifies the family.
To wrap up, of course, like every other thing ageing population have negative consequences. Since it should not be expected that we would die at young age, we should devise policies that how to shrink drawbacks of ageing population.

In many countries crime is increasing. What are the main reasons for this? What can be done to improve the situation?
Support your position with relevant examples and include your own experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
The increase in crime rate is a pressing problem and fear across the world. Many nations are struggling with the increased criminal activities. The situation is very alarming as it affects every sphere of everyday life. The reasons of increase in crime rate are linked to poverty and vulnerable judicial system.
Crime is getting worse around the globe, especially in poverty stricken nations. In the poorer nations, unemployment is a great curse that the significant numbers of people are jobless. In the situation, when they are paid for criminal activities, they tend to do them without any hesitation. This is because they need money severely for their survival. For example, the pandemic poverty plagues Somalia that many people try to escape from the poverty by becoming pirates and attacking people to get money. On the top of that most of the people in crime ridden nations have lost their faith in their judicial system. The criminals who have committed heinous crimes are set free due to loopholes in the system. As a result, the culprits have no fear for law and they take part in criminal activities again and again.
In my opinion, the government of the nations should devise proper programs to alleviate poverty and also should pass strict law in order to reduce crime rate. To improve socio-economic condition in the poverty-ridden nation, crime rates could be decreased significantly. That is to say that introducing programs in favour of development so that the private sectors can create considerable job opportunities by building factories and industries is the silver bullet for stooping the crime rate. In addition to this, the governments also have to reform the judicial system in order to eliminate pitfalls in the system. When the notorious criminals are punished fearfully, it is considered a mirror at which other criminals can look and they do not dare to commit crimes.
In fine, crimes are soaring in many countries. To effectively reduce the crime rate, the government of the nations should develop the socio-economic condition and also should reform their judicial system. By following this course of action, the crime rate would be dropped arguably, I believe.

Logging of the rain forests is a serious problem and it may lead to the extinction of animal life and human life. 
Discuss.
You should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support arguments with example and relevant evidence.
You should write at least 250 words.

Model Answer: 
Every year, large areas of rain forest are logged in order to exploit timber commercially or some other purposes. In the last fifty years, much of the rain forest in Asia and Africa has been destroyed. Unfortunately, the destruction of these rain forests has myriad of negative impacts on animals and human being as well.
Logging of rain forest contributes to the habitat fragmentation, loss or in other word habitat destruction is one of the major causes of animal extinction. Actually habitat changes loose biotic integrity, for example ecosystem, health, etc. Habitat fragmentation may cause dearth of food for animals. On the top of that, cutting down rain forest also contribute to global warming. This causes an irreversible loss in the diversity of life in the affected rain forests. As a result, animals go to extinction day by day.
Similarly, human civilization is also in danger due to chopping down the rain forests. Plants play a paramount role in keeping the earth habitable. Let me clarify a bit more. During the photosynthesis process, plants filter the carbon dioxide (CO2) of the atmosphere and releases oxygen (O2) into the air. According to Greenpeace, 300 billions of carbon, 40 times annual greenhouse gases emissions from fossil fuels is conserved in trees. So, the logging of trees and plants not only decrease the amount of carbon dioxide stored but also releases it into the atmosphere. This is because when a tree is cut down, it releases the stored carbon. Consequently, deforestation of rain forests contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Global warming is one of the most pressing problems of human civilization in the contemporary world. Global warming causes several natural calamities like, Tsunami, earthquake, drought and so on. As a result, the planet is becoming unsuitable for human life day by day.
From the above discussion, it could be easily concluded that the destroying rain forest is not only harmful for animals but also for human beings. So, we have to stop cutting down rain forest in order to pass a better earth to our next generation.

Education is not a luxury, but a basic human right and as such should be free for everyone irrespective of personal wealth.
Do you agree or disagree?
Sample Answer:
Human being is born with some fundamental rights and these rights should be entertained equally. Actually equality refers to the disadvantaged can enjoy the same life chances as everyone else. And education is one of the cornerstones of these rights. So, the rights to education should be the same life chance for all whether one is wealthy or not, I strongly believe.
Education develops individual’s personality, unlocks full potential, and prepares individuals to participate in the society. That is to say that education ultimately thrives the mankind. And it is our duty as human being to foster mankind. That is why, many international organizations have already acknowledged education as the fundamental human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of United Nations is a very good example here. According to the article 26 of the declaration, education is treated as fundamental rights that it should be free for all, at least in the elementary level.
Similarly, education should be free for all regardless of individual’s financial affluence. This is because, education, being the most crucial human rights, is extremely necessary for the exercise of all other human rights. It enlightens people that promote individual freedom and empowerment. Most importantly, education is a magical tool by which socially and economically marginalized individuals can lift themselves out of poverty and can act as dignified citizen. So, education is silver bullet for combating against poverty and access to education is not prerogative of privileged circles of society.
In fine, many people contend that right to education or free education for all is not a realist idea. I strongly oppose their argument. A government, of course, cannot introduce an educational system over night, it takes money, and it takes time. But right to education enforce a government to build an inclusive quality education system over a period of time.

Developed countries have created many environmental problems in the World, particularly in their contribution to global warming.
What can be done to reduce the dangers of global warming?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
There is no denying that our environment is going from bad to worse incessantly. Developed nations are responsible in causing these environmental damages. The tangible consequence of these damages is global warming. Many climate scientists warn that if we are not aware immediately or do not make any effective steps to curb the change, we have to compensate to a great extent. However, they also prescribe some solutions to the graving problem.
Many researches reveal that the climate change may contribute to the increase of world temperature by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit in less than a century. The climatologists warn that this global warming is going to affect to rising sea level, agricultural losses, ecosystem, and social turbulence. They conjure up various terrible scenario of what may be happened from the global warming to elucidate the gravity of this pressing condition. For instance, America’s Great Plains will no more be the world’s major crop producer and Canada will also embrace the same fate.
However, in spite of these pessimistic forecasts, climate scientists present guidelines to tame global warming in order for sustainable development. The enormity of global warming is caused primarily by too much heat-trapping carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane in the atmosphere. But the remedy is at our hand that we can dramatically decrease the emission of these toxic gases. We can make a great step by eliminating the burning of coal, oil, and eventually natural gas as these are the main sources of carbon emission. As a sensible man, we can contribute to the reduction of our personal carbon emissions. In the developed world, people literally eat, wear, play, and even sleep on the products made from fossilized sunshine. So, we can forgo fossil fuels by slight compromise to our cozy life in order for grater welfare for mankind. In addition to this, stopping deforestation is another vital action what is most important in reducing carbon emissions.
In fine, reducing carbon emissions is critical to any serious effort to combat climate change. The above discussions clearly shows that we can quell carbon emissions easily just by making some practical effort like forgo fossil fuels or stopping deforestation. We should decrease the pace of global warming and, ought to pass on a safer, healthier earth to our future generation.

Blood sports have become a hot topic for debate in recent years. As society develops it is increasingly seen as an uncivilized activity and cruel to the helpless animals that are killed. All blood sports should be banned.
Discuss the main arguments for this statement and give your own opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer :
Blood sports, in common parlance, involve a combat or fight in which two animals are involved and the fight ends with the dying of one of them. Actually, the entertainment activity has been celebrated since hundreds of years and was known as hunting at that time. During primitive age, hunting is sheer necessity, but now it has become a popular mode of entertainment. More than 13,000 animals are killed owing to blood sports according to a recent online survey in U.S. The information unveils the cruelty of us. It should be banned immediately. The following reasons could explain why.
Blood sports manifest the felony of human being. It is certainly not humane to make animals violence each other as they inferior to human being. We as human beings have no right to inflict pain upon each other and our attitude should be no different. Suffering is suffering and killing an animal merely for entertainment is deliberate brutality at its worst. In addition to this, a large scale illegal gambling is involved in blood sports. Moreover, many animal fighter administers stimulate drugs to animals so that animals can last long in the fight in order to make the fight bloodier.
Again, not only do blood sports result in animal deaths, but also it has a negative impact on human psyche. Many behavioral experts contend that people who watch blood sports on a regular basis tend to behave violently. On the top of that, it has a great negative effect on kids. It is noticed that kids who are exposed to violence at an early age grow up to be insensitive towards both humans and animals. They tend to believe that these events are the harsh reality of life and this impacts on their brain development terribly. Such kids, very often, indulge violence in behavior.
In pithy, blood sports are the cruel manifestation of human beings. We should pass stringent laws in order to ban these brutal entertainments. In my belief, humanity’s true moral test comprises of its treatment towards those who are at its grace.

Some people believe the aim of university education is to help graduates get better jobs. Others believe there are much wider benefits of university education for both individuals and society.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Education, particularly university education, helps climb the ladder of success in this cut-throat competitive world. However, when it comes to the point that what the objective of university education is, there is sharp differences on this matter. In many circles, it is contended that the purpose of university education is to helps graduates get better jobs, while others feels that the true objective is to quest for knowledge, wisdom so the individuals can enlighten themselves as well as the society. While both the sides have merits, I incline to the second notion.
To start with, it goes without saying that higher education is deemed as extremely important in the modern contemporary society, and for most people a university degree has become the essential ticket to get a well-paid job. Even Barack Obama stresses saying this that “in a global market where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer a pathway to opportunity—it is a prerequisite”. Actually, employers tend to recruit university graduates because they have already prove their talent, determination, attitude to accomplishing goal as these are the crucial aspects of an ideal employee.
On the contrary, many a people argue that the core objective of tertiary education should point at how to extract knowledge and how to create new knowledge. That is to say that university education should stress on quality teaching and research programs so that the students are able to create, translate and disseminate knowledge and wisdom to advance the nation, the mankind and, to sharp their mind both spiritually and intellectually as well. They outcry for not to diminish the broader role into mere corporate interest.
In my opinion, I agree that university should not be the factory for producing workers. I believe that if it is it would the mockery of higher education that only focuses on employable graduates. No doubt, it is a good idea to produce more workers regarding short term benefit. But the notion is very devastating in terms of long-term benefits. When you come up with an approach educating students to compatible to workplace, this will result in producing some kind of robots. Let me clarify a bit more. A student with only job skills means he can do only those tasks he is coded like robots. In contrast, if a student has a broad understanding of concepts through seeing it in the context of wide spectrum and has keen knowledge on logic behind the concepts, he then not only produce new knowledge but also can work in innovative fashion.
In a nutshell, what I would like to say that higher education’s objectives should be pursuit in terms of broader perspectives and the job competence would be its logical consequence.

Many people believe that teachers should also teach students how to judge right from wrong and how to behave, while others think they should just teach academic subjects.
What is your opinion?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Teaching is very demanding and complex task, which build or ruin the student’s career life. Here are some myths regarding teaching as the key role of teaching is considered to deliver information to student, and to evaluate the student achievement in return. Some people believe that the teaching is thankless profession, teachers are biased towards grading rather than using standardized testing, keep favoritism, they can only teach because they can’t do anything else etc. Therefore according to some believers teachers should be limited to teaching rather than other student behavioral involvements.
In my opinion the teacher is not only a transmitter of information, rather responsible for all kind of student’s behaviors. A teacher should be both teacher centered and student centered, for example they should deliver information on the child level, and should understand the child point of view according to their mental level. A teacher can polish their student by modifying their undesirable behaviors, as a student spend more quality time with teachers, so they can learn more desirable behaviors from them. A teacher observe verbal nonverbal cues, eye contact, posture gesture of students and can understand when and why an undesirable behavior occur and how it can be prevent. Students respect or dread more from their teacher rather than parents, through reinforcement, punishment and reciprocal inhibition, teacher can easily trained a lot to students. Some students show low performance in test, teacher should observe all the possible reasons and take steps to make capable them to face the hurdles.
Parent teacher counseling also should be conducted to assess the problematic behavior of the child to enhance his performance, for example sometime parents pressurize their kids in the selection of unwanted subjects as a result student lose their interest in studies, sometimes parent child relationship or parents mutual relationship, sibling comparison or other environmental factor like bullying, isolation from peers distress the child to keep concentration in studies and as a result the child began to indulge in behavioral or academic problems. A good teacher teach their students to face such circumstances patiently.
While teachers don’t find it easy to manage all academic and behavioral problem in the same time without parental involvement, but the parental unrealistic and over expectation form teachers causing difficulties for their own kids. Through awareness workshops, brochures, pamphlets parents should be psycho-educated that without their support all the goals regarding child academic and behavioral well-being is hard to achieve.

Many people believe that cooking is an essential life skill and should be taught to boys and girls in schools. Others disagree and believe it is a waste of school time.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
It goes without saying that Cooking is a crucial life skill. But people are split in their opinion when it comes to the issue of adding the cooking in academic curriculum. Some people argue that the skill should be taught to pupils in schools. Yet other people put forward the view that it would be a waste of school time. To my way of thinking, It should not be compulsory in schools.
To commence with, human beings, throughout the history, have been learned many essential life skills, such as hunting, fishing, cooking to name but a few, in order to survive in adverse situation. With the advance of technology, however, people tend to ignore many practical skills, and cooking is one of them. Therefore, some people think that boys and girls should be taught how to cook healthier meals. Not only does it help them to acquire an essential skill, but they also adapt to healthy food habits, which by consequence will reduce the chance of being obese.
However, the students should not waste their school hours spending time on cooking. There are several important courses, such as science, math, history, language, and so on, to be taught with great care. If cooking is made compulsory in curriculum, then one or two major courses would be compromised eventually. The major courses are far more valuable when it comes to point of seeking job compared with cooking. In my opinion, one does not necessarily attain the skill. Once, cooking was a cumbersome job, but, nowadays, the technological advance has made preparing food so convenient even for the clumsiest individual. So it would be insensible to make cook compulsory in academic curriculum.
All things considered, it seems reasonable to assert that adding cooking in curriculum would be nothing but waste of time. But the onus is on parents to teach their offspring cooking as it is an important practical skill they need.

Nowadays plastic money replacements such as credit and debit cards are extremely popular, even more than banknotes and coins.
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this. Include your personal opinion and examples based on your own experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Plastic money, in common parlance, refers to the hard plastic cards, which are used prevalently in everyday instead of bank notes or coins. With the advance of technology, most banks offers their customers debit card, credit card that can be used for withdrawing money and making purchase as well; online as well as offline. Plastic money, however, has some inconveniences that one must be cautious about.
Plastic money has several benefits to be mentioned. First and foremost, it eliminates the need for carrying cash, which in turn reduces the risk and inconvenience. This means that one needs not to carry out heavy wallet, hence, there is no chance of theft.
Likewise, plastic money has the distinctive advantage and convenience of using it anytime, anywhere across the country, even abroad. That is to say that one can withdraw or debit the demanded cash in case of instantaneous want for money.
Apart from that, people are now able to buy on credit or pay later with the help of credit card. In addition to this, consumers are offered miles on every purchase using credit card. Let me elaborate a bit more. On every purchase by credit card, a consumer gets points which get aggregated in his account. When the consumer has a good amount of points, he can use these points for purchasing any commodity or product for free.
Last but not the least, consumers can use cards for fund transfer and various other transactions. They, now, do not have to wait for bank to open, but can make any transaction online with help of cards.
Having said that, plastic money has some drawbacks. Consumers cannot purchase from small retail outlets by cards due they do not accept these cards. Besides, plastic money cannot be used for all daily needs, for instance milkman or servant payment. So, consumers can use it only in supermarkets and hypermarkets. Moreover, many outlets charge additional service charge for the cards. To cap it all, cards are just a plastic which can be stolen or lost. This may lead to serious incident. Take my father for example. He lost his credit card during a trip, but he was not aware of it. One fine day, my father found that $5000 worth of purchase has been made on his credit card when he checked his bank account.
Summing all of the above, it seems reasonable to assume that plastic money is a double-edge sword. Consumers should take the all advantages of plastic money, while they also ought to be careful about its limitations.

Some people feel that the care of old people is the responsibility of government while other say children of those parents must take care of them.
Discuss both viewpoints and give your opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Irrefutably, nowadays, the issue of looking after of old people has sparked a heated debate. Considering this, many analysts hold an opinion that the government authorities must take the responsibility of the senior citizens; however, others opine that children should nurse their own parents. This essay will ascertain both sides of the contention before deducing a reasonable conclusion.
Certainly, there are some factors wherein arguments in favour of nurturing of elderly by the regulatory bodies could be supported. First and foremost, contribution to the welfare of the community could be considered a substantial factor. The elderly people had worked for their entire lives, and had paid taxes; therefore, at this age, they must receive pensions, free medical facilities in return. Establishment of old age homes and Geriatric hospitals by many developed countries for the welfare of this group could be taken as a live example. In addition, senior citizens act as a liaison to bind younger generations to their cultural roots, hence, the nation must treasure them.
Despite the views discussed above concerning role of government in fostering of this vulnerable group, some people argue that parents must be looked after by their offspring. Moral and social duty of the children towards their parents could be the prime reason behind opponent’s viewpoint .It may be defined as parents do all in their power in bringing up of their children, they sacrifice their own desires to fulfil the dreams of their children. Hence, it becomes the primary duty of children to ensure physical, emotional and financial wellbeing to their parents. Moreover, everyone needs family support to have contented life, likewise, old people need family to ensure wisdom.
To conclude, although, government must be devoted to render the welfare services for senior citizens, yet, as far as I am concerned, I staunchly believe that children must be obliged to pay their gratitude towards the devotion and dedication of their parents by taking care of them at this crucial phase of life.

Space exploration is much too expensive and the money should be spent on more important things.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Space exploration has become a hot-button issue as it is hugely expensive. In many circles, it is argued that the government ought to put taxpayer money toward solving other pressing issues. In the instance, I am of the honest opinion that space exploration is not worth the money, and therefore, the budget should be allotted to other severe problems.
Many nations around the word suffer from pandemic poverty. These countries do not have sufficient resources to meet the needs of the population. In consequence, the government cannot even provide the population with basic needs like education. And illiteracy perpetuates poverty. For example, many studies show that millions of adults struggle to earn a living for themselves and their families due to they are unable to read or write. If the affluent nations lend a hand with facilitating education in the poor regions, then the hundreds of thousands of people could get rid of this poverty curse.
Besides, I think space exploration is a gimmick. The Americans do it in order to gain competitive edge over their counterparts. However, there are far more crucial endeavours to fund, for example, the discovery of our own planet. The volcanic regions are not yet explored fully, as is Antarctica. I believe that the knowledge available in our own planet, especially organisms that inhabit the regions with extreme conditions, are far more worth spending than that of space.
From what has been discussed above, it could be easy said that space exploration is nothing but wasting money. I think that the huge sums of money we spend on space exploration are gone in smoke. Rather, we spend these amounts to eradicate poverty. In short, I would like to say that we should explore our own planet and fix its issues before thinking in space exploration.

As the number of private cars has increased, so too has the level of pollution in many cities. What can be done to tackle this increasing common problem?
You should write at least 250 words.

Sample Answer:
Environmental pollution is the most pressing issue of our country. With the growing numbers of private vehicles, the tier of pollution is being swollen. In the case, government and individuals should go hand in hand in order to ameliorate the situation.
To commence with, the more private cars on the road means the more CO2 emissions. So, the government should devise new policy in order to curb vehicular emissions. A case in point is an “odd/even” number formula for private cars of Delhi government, which allows cars with odd number plate and even number plate to ply on alternate days. Moreover, the government should launch campaign so as to encourage people to use public transport. This is because more people can trip in a single bus or train, which by consequence would reduce private cars on the roads. Furthermore, the government can increase the price of fuels to dissuade using private vehicles, which in turn may reduce the cars on the roads. As a result, the increase in fuel price could solve the growing problem of pollution.
Likewise, individuals ought to make effort to reduce the pollution. People can make it by changing their driving habit. That is to say, if people drive less, then the vehicle exhaust would be reduced sharply. To that end, people may make a single trip to stock up on all the groceries they need instead of driving to the shops several times. Apart from that, families should not buy more cars than they need. Since, the more fuel it consumes, the more pollution it causes.
In fine, environmental pollution caused by private cars is now a cause for concern in the country. The individuals should take steps on a personal level so as to combat against the growing pollution issue in tandem with the government.

In some countries an increasing number of people are suffering from health problems as a result of eating too much fast food. It is therefore necessary for governments to impose a higher tax on this kind of food.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Today, many health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, and so on, are stemmed from eating too much junk food. Many economists argue that government should intervene taxing on fast food when the market fails to provide the optimum amount of healthy food for society’s well-being. In the case, I share the view that the government ought to impose tax a high tax on fast food can play an important role in curbing health issues caused by fast food.
For a start, unhealthy eating habit is a consequence of economic hardship. The healthy food items are simply more expensive than unhealthy items. Over the last two decades, fruits and vegetable, in many parts of industrial world, have almost doubled in price. On the other hand, paradoxically, many processed foods’ cost has fallen sharply over the same period. This is because the magical development in manufacturing, packaging, and flavouring are lowering the price of processed foods. Consequently, people, particularly poor, tend to rely on unhealthy foods. That is why, the government have to levy a fat tax on fast food so that people are encouraged to choose healthier foods.
Apart from that, fat tax on fast food should be accompanied by subsidies on healthy food. A recent study, published in the British Medical Journal, revealed that fat tax ought to be accompanied by subsidies for healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables help encourage a noteworthy change in dietary habits. This means that the most effective solution to health problems caused by unhealthy foods is to levy on unhealthy foods accompanied by subsidies on healthy foods.
To recapitulate, the cost of healthy food has increased more than that of unhealthy items, thereby enticing diet that leads to excess weight. Levy on junk food couples with subsidies for healthy food would be the silver bullet for the problems stemmed from poor dietary habits.

One day the world’s oil and gas reserves will run out. The search for alternative energy sources like wind power, solar power, burning waste, and water power are causing as much environmental damage as the oil and unclear power sources they are intended to replace.
How far do you agree with this latter statement?
What possible benefits do the alternative energy sources bring? Or what damages do they cause?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1: 
Fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, are being used at breakneck pace that the future for fuels looks quite bleak. Many scientists present us with an apocalyptic vision of the future that the fossil fuels will be exhausted very soon. That is why, people are looking for alternative energy sources, for example wind power, solar power, burning waste and water power. But some people contend that alternative energy sources are also harmful as they cause damage environment as much as fossil fuels. In my opinion, the search for alternative energy sources is not causing as much as environmental pollution as the fossil fuels.
To begin with, alternative energy sources are more eco-friendly than fossil fuels. Compare with coal, which emits between 1.4 and 3.6 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour (CO2E/kWh), natural gas emits between 0.6 and 2 pounds of CO2E/kWh, wind releases only 0.02 to 0.04 pounds of CO2E/kWh , solar releases between 0.02 and 0.7 pounds of CO2E/kWh, and hydroelectric 0.1 to 0.5 pounds of CO2E/kWh. The snippets of information clearly show that these renewable energy sources do not emit detrimental gases that cause global warming or air pollution.
Apart from that, renewable energy industry can generate myriad job opportunities. This is because the industry is more labour-intensive than fossil fuel technologies, which are usually capital-intensive and mechanized. This means that more jobs are created for each unit of electricity produced from the alternative energy sources than that of fossil fuels.
All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume that alternative energy sources are conducive to green environment and poverty alleviation program. It, therefore, is the high time to discard fossil fuel projects and switch to alternative energy sources.

Should parents be obliged to immunise their children against common childhood diseases? Or do individuals have the right to choose not to immunise their children? 
What is your view of this practice?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
Undoubtedly, childhood diseases can have a serious effect on children, thus, many people state that children should be vaccinated in order to protect them against many fatal diseases. However, there are also arguments against this viewpoint which present that parents should make decision whether their children should be immunised or not. Therefore, the following composition is to examine the both viewpoints mentioned.
To begin with, it is completely true to admit that immunising children brings various benefits to them as follows. First, vaccination helps to safeguard against many common childhood diseases. Indeed, children’s week immune system makes them very sensitive to infection.  Therefore, they would benefit the most from vaccination. Apart from that, the cost for vaccinating infants is cheap or even free in some countries. This thing will save a lot of money for parents. More importantly, compared to costly treatment for an unvaccinated child vaccination is cheaper and more efficient as it prevents many diseases in the long term.
On the other hand, there are people who believe that parents should have the right to decide to vaccinate their children. However, this idea is unreasonable in that no parents would choose not to let their children benefit from vaccination. Therefore, parents should be educated about this information rather than to obligate them to immunise their offspring. Eventually, children without vaccination may suffer from many unnecessary diseases and become a burden to both their parents and the whole society.
In brief, as discussed above, there are many positive effects that offer vaccinated children in the long term. In my opinion, I strongly concur with the policy that children should be vaccinated since they were born so as to prevent many deadly diseases.
[ Written by – Duongthien Ly ]
Sample Answer 2:
One of the most controversial issues today is whether immunization of children against childhood diseases be made mandatory or it should be by choice. In this essay, I am going to discuss both views and then give my own opinion on the matter.
On the one hand, some people in the society hold the view that government should make immunization compulsory for a child born to a family across the nation according to the National Programme on immunization. The main reason for this is that recently there has been an increase in the infant mortality and morbidity rates which was published in the monthly Journal of Pediatric diseases. It is now obvious that more children under 5 years now die from preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella and tuberculosis. For example, a recent statistics of National Hospital reveals that one out of hundred births dies before his or her first birthday due to some preventable diseases. The statistics strengthens the argument that parents should be obliged to vaccinate their children against some fatal diseases cause infant mortality.
On the other hand, there are some superstitious people who rebuke the idea of immunization. In the most cases, the reasons they present do not make sense. For instance, many of them concede that vaccination is a way to render their male children sterile, thus reducing their population. And regrettably, they drive away the health personnel who carry vaccines. Therefore, the government should make vaccination mandatory for all.
To wrap up, every year hundreds of infants die owing to the diseases which could be prevented by vaccination. The loss of an infant remains a grieved reality for many families and takes its toll on the health and welfare, as well as the nation. That is why, I want government make it sure that children are immunized against common childhood diseases. There is no compromise when it comes to infant mortality, I believe.

Some people think that the government should fund music, dance and arts lessons for children. Others think that they should be funded by private businesses or by children’s families.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Arts and culture streamlines our society by relieving stress of modern hectic life. However, some people claim in their argument that the government should bankroll music, dance and arts lessons for children, while many others argue that the onus is on the private sectors or their parents to support these programmes. To my way of thinking, the above mentioned programmes should be financed by the government, and private organizations and interested children’s parents.
To start with, arts and culture are essential to the proper functioning of a nation as it fuels a sense of oneness and unity. In the case, each government’s priority is to cherish the unity of nation. To that end, access to music and arts should be an important part of a government plan for education to ensure all children get a balanced and broad education. The government should fund local music, dance and cultural education programmes so that children have the opportunity to experience a wide range of art and cultural activities on their doorstep. Not only will this enrich their experience they need at a young age, but will foster the creative thinking which in turn will robust the nation’s creative industry.
Likewise, private sector should support art and culture that is essential in building communities in which the private sector can thrive. It ought to provide the children with the opportunity to hone their skills and competences, and to develop their confidence and unique talents in arts disciplines, such as music, dance and art. Similarly, it is the onus on parents to ensure a well-rounded education that rich their offspring’s experience.
Summing all of the above, arts and cultural education is essential for the overall well-being of children. Since children are future of a nation, the public authorities and other concerning bodies should aid art and culture, for instance music, dance and art.

In the past, when students did a university degree, they tended to study in their own country. Nowadays, they have more opportunity to study abroad. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this development?
You should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support arguments with example and relevant evidence.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Today, more and more students tend to go overseas for study compared to the past. Students enroll at foreign universities in order to have the edge over their competitors. However, the trend has both benefits and drawbacks.
To commence with, studying abroad has immense advantages. First of all, it will unveil a new horizon offering a new culture to the students who enroll at overseas universities. By studying abroad, the students get the opportunity to be acquainted with a foreign nation and culture, which by consequence broadens their perspectives. As a result, it will help them overcome racial or any other prejudice. Secondly, studying abroad can advance academic and career trajectory. That is to say, students get the chance to experience different styles of learning and researching methods that provide the students with the knowledge and skills required to excel in the ever-expanding global workplace. Last but not the least, studying abroad helps hone the students’ language skills quickly.
On the flip side, studying abroad has also some disadvantages. Sometimes, students find it difficult to cope with the new culture and surrounding. On the top of that, they feel sad and homesick which might hamper their academic performance. In addition to this, studying abroad is usually expensive. It ranges moderately expensive to very expensive. Furthermore, when international students are not allowed to engage in part-time job, it might become nightmare for them.
To conclude, every coin has two sides: opportunities and limitations. Studying abroad has both the advantages and disadvantages. So, students should mull over the benefits and drawbacks before leaving the homeland to study abroad.

Cinema attendance in some countries is on the decline. What do you think are the causes of this development and what measures could be taken to solve it?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
In the past, going to the cinema was one of the commonest ways to spend one’s free time. However, nowadays, in some nations, this is not the case anymore. This essay will suggest that the root causes for this phenomenon is poor local film industry and the high cost of cinema tickets. Thus, the solutions will be to improve the movies’ quality and making the fee payable by all the population.
The principle reason for the decline in cinema attendance in some countries is the poor local movie quality. Today, the main target for any film industry in these countries is only to gain some money, instead of entertaining the audience. Thus, they tend to hire inexperienced actors and use cheap resources, so that they pay less and hence, gain more. Another reason to mention is that, the tickets are being even more expensive than before, which restricts the attendance to rich people, while even medium-classed population cannot afford its costs.
The most practical solution to tackle this issue is to enhance the quality of film industry. Film makers can hire well-experienced actors and actresses, and pay more in production and advertising. This will increase the attendance and in turn will increase the profits. Government can also help by buying international movies like Hollywood movies. One other important measure to increase numbers of audience is to lower the costs of attendance, so as to make it accessible to all population regardless of their ability to pay.
To summarize, the decline in cinema attendance has become a widespread problem in some countries. Bad quality of local film industry is one of the most important causes, but fortunately, there are many ways to improve this situation. So, this problem is expected to be solved in the coming years.

Some people feel that there is too much emphasis on getting an education, and that government should spend money on leisure time activities for young people too.
To what extent do you agree or disagree.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
It is often argued that government have always channelled its resources solely to education and thus neglected the provision of recreational venues for the younger generation. In my opinion, I firmly agree with the statement that government lay more emphasis on acquisition of degrees than leisure activities and should allocate a big portion of the education budget for the leisure and creative activities for youngsters. This essay will discuss, firstly, the importance of acquiring knowledge and secondly, the benefits that comes with having a good grade or a university degree.
Firstly, since time immemorial, education has proven to be of essence to mankind. Human beings long for information and knowledge. This is because with knowledge and education, one can be relevant and can aspire to become somebody in life. As a result, government has taken it as a responsibility to always invest in the educational sector in order to produce future leaders of tomorrow. For example, government would rather produce more doctors, engineers than produce athletes.
Secondly, being educated comes with its own benefits. One of such benefits is securing a good employment when one graduates from a university. Additionally, having a high number of academicians adds to the growth of the economy. Lastly, education helps to eradicate illiteracy and makes an individual to think of new horizons. It is clearly evident that government is always right to invest more in education than in recreation or sports.
In conclusion, both education and recreation have their merits. On the balance, however, I think that investing in education is more profiting than wasting money on leisure activities.

Sample Answer 2:
Since the revolution of industry, countries suddenly faced with this fact that they suffered from lack of well-educated worker, so since that time, they have been devoted their entire resources to elimination illiteracy. However, this trend causes less attention to some parts of human life such as leisure time activities. It is agreed that it would bring some benefits for both younger generation and societies to invest money on the leisure activities.
To begin with, today lifestyle of students is based on immense effort on their curriculum to meet their target as soon as possible. According to a famous psychologist Dr. Smith, to boost brain’s performance it is highly recommended to allocate specific time each day, to do just some pleasure activities such playing football, hanging out with your friends and so on. These kinds of activities help teenagers to reduce overall stress and being ready for learning new subjects. In addition, these activities would help them to overcome some unpleasant personal traits such as lack of self-confident and so on. Thus, allocating budget on leisure activities is vitally important for youth.
In addition, without having adequate refreshment facilities, in some circumstance societies have to tolerate with its side effects. Youngsters need to fill their free time with some activities so may be being involved in some criminal activities such as graffiti, vandalism just for fun. It is obvious these minor crimes lead to their neighborhood in jeopardy. For example, in my home town, rate of pity crimes is rapidly increasing in down town area as this area does not have sufficient parks, cinema, and gym and so on. This example makes it clear that for having a healthy society we should pay attention to free time activities.
To sum up, after analyzing these points of views, my opinion emphasizes that leisure time activity is as important as educational curriculum. Therefore, both youth and society will benefit from its advantages. It is highly recommended, government invest some money on these kinds of activities.

In your opinion should government intervene in the rights of the individual with regard to family planning?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer: 
The explosion of population is very stark problem around the world. However, when the issue is about family planning, it is generally related to all decisions of every couple concerning how many children to have in the family. Such things like birth planning, abortion are very personal aspect and that is why the government intervene in these areas is considered to be intrusive. However, I think the government should interfere with the rights of the individual in case of overpopulation.
Overpopulation lags behind in the progress of a nation. So in the instance, the government should have the right to control and plan families of the nation. In order to ensure the nation’s development and progress, the government needs to determine the number of children should have a couple so as to provide a population enough to serve the needs of the nation, and yet not large control that impedes the progress of the economy. Actually, overpopulation is one of the major culprits that cause poverty. And a nation can prosper to control its population. China is a very good example here. The government of the country introduced their birth control policy with one-child in a family policy introduction that took place in 1979. And no doubt, now China has evolved as the biggest economic power of the world.
However, come to think of it, government should not intervene in the family matters like abortion and birth right. Family affairs are absolutely private and couples themselves should have the rights to decide what family is suitable for them, poor and illiterate couple cannot decide it sensibly, although. The government, hence, can create awareness about negative impact of overpopulation.
To recapitulate, overpopulation puts curse on many countries. It is one of the reasons that cause pandemic poverty. In the cases, the government should have right to intervene in the family affairs, and where there is need to control population, it would be obvious violation of human rights.

Some schools agree that fast food restaurants and supermarkets can promote their products in school and that schools benefit from it. Is it a positive or a negative development?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Fast Food Company and supermarkets have become the powerful force and major source of nutrition in our economy. The fast foods are getting overwhelming popularity in school, universities, colleges and offices in fact all over the world.
The fast food marketing has targeted to children because school children assessed to be more vulnerable towards fast-foods because kids lack the judgment of adults and are potential new life-long customers, fast food marketers have targeted children.
Toys and other tactics of marketing like television, internet, are by far the most popular form of marketing to exploit the children’s vulnerability by fast food corporations. Children were also targeted in their own communities through the use of billboards and through local environments such as stores, restaurants, and schools, which was giving the harmful effect of this marketing environment on children’s health.
As the popularity of fast food is increasing, the child started suffering from poor-diet conditions and calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods, which is causing health related problems like Obesity, Asthma, Liver disease, and Stroke, Cancer, and Cardiovascular disease. The school authority also confesses that their products are promoting by such junk foods, and teachers who were considered to be the part of child well-wisher also assessed to be involved in supporting such products.
Schools should be a place where children are free from corporate marketing. But many parents, teachers and even school administrators are taking a stand by setting strong policies to keep fast food corporations out of the learning environment. The government should take steps to ban the excessive use of fast foods in schools to save the children’s health because the children are the most crucial part of a nation, the progress of any nation depends on new generation.

Many people believe that computers can take over the classrooms.
Do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Computer is the machine that has swept everything else away in its course. There is an onslaught of computer on the modern classroom. Educators, parents, and students alike are being argued that computer is the whetstone with which our education system will be sharpen. Many people contend that it will replace teachers. In the instance, I opine that compute will not. Rather, it will cause a greater demand for teachers.
To begin with, as much innovation as the computer brings to the classrooms, it cannot take over the classrooms. In fact, the prevalence of computer in the classrooms means the teachers are needed to a great extent. To put it another way, teachers are required to help how computer works for each learner, and where its application is appropriate. For example, computer functions with a pre-set program and it is unable to explain a topic according to students’ level of understanding. Computer, therefore, may play a significant role only with the help of teachers.
Besides, a teacher is not merely an automaton that hands out information to the students. He is a guide, leader, facilitator, and mentor above all. He encourages students when they grapple with problems, and inspires them to set and attain their goals. He plays the pivotal role in the students’ life as a role model, leads by examples, and gives directions when necessary. A computer can convey information, but a teacher can lend compassionate support to the students and find what is crucial for a student to succeed.
To wrap up, computer is going to play an important role in the future of education. But it cannot play as vital a role as that of a teacher. So, the teachers are not going to be replaced by the computers.

Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer: 
University plays a vital role in modern education system. People, however, are split in their opinion when it comes to the issue of successful career. Some people contend that earning a university or college degree is the best way to a brilliant career, while others refute the argument and opine that youngsters should enter into job field straight after school. To my way of thinking, if success connotes high-flying career, then yes, university degree is the only key to obtain it.
For a start, many experts argue that university education merely trains pupils in academic subjects, and that is often irrelevant to the skills they need in workplace. That is to say, university programme does not equip the students with the conceptual and managerial skills and competencies that are vital for professional career. There is, in fact, a huge gap exists between the theory and the practical need. In contrast, when the students start working immediately after leaving school, they can acquire business acumen and mandatory skills needed in job fields. Actually, the working experience gives them an extra edge over their counterparts who have the university qualification.
On the other hand, tertiary education aims at how to extract knowledge and how to produce new knowledge. Thereby, they are able to ride on the flow of change. On the other hand, the employees who do not have university degree know manually how to carry out a task in a particular situation. They, very often, cannot cope with changing working environment. In my opinion, however, having a university degree implies a commitment to learning and a standard of intelligence that one needs in the job. That is to say that the employees with a bachelor degree have more critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills than their counterparts. They can deal properly with any issue. Consequently, employees with a bachelor degree would be preferred when it comes to get the distinguished career.
In fine, anybody can be successful in his professional life without university degree. But when it comes to a glittering career, employees with bachelor degree have an edge over their competitors. So, having a university or college degree is the first step on the corporate ladder of success.

Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
Nowadays, more and more people prefer digital books instead of traditional text books. However, the trend is a double-edge sword as it has both advantages and disadvantages. Both the merits and demerits include the following paragraphs.
To begin with, the recent trend towards digital books has enormous advantages. The readers of digital books are gaining momentum and are poised to achieve a breakthrough that will significantly transform the book industry. That is to say that the manufacturers will build new devices, developers will introduce new formats, and the companies will create new business model that all are compatible to the cutting-edge technologies.
Apart from that, the trend will encourage the publishers to provide the readers with a significant part of backlisted titles and new releases in digital form. This means that readers will be able to access instantly to a vast range of books. In addition to this, the trend will unfold new sources of revenue could be generated through the means of personalized offers and impulse buying. Furthermore, the trend can contribute in reducing environmental damages as traditional book industry harvests hundreds of thousands of trees every day that emit massive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the flip side, the growing trend towards eBooks has some dark sides also. Many researchers find that screen reading causes more stress and exhaustion, and needs more efforts than paper reading. So, the trend will swell the number of patients stemmed from stress. Furthermore, eBooks can cause eyestrain. Computer, tablet, or any other gadgets used to read texts strain eyes more than reading printing text, since we blink less while using computer or other devices to read eBooks.
To wrap up, the increasing trend of reading eBooks has benefits and drawbacks. The limitations, however, are outweighed by the opportunities.

Sample Answer 1:
Loneliness has been a topic of much debate among modern psychologists. Some are of the opinion that loneliness is detrimental to one’s life while others feel that loneliness has a lot of merits. This essay is going to highlight some advantages as well as demerits of loneliness and then give my opinion.
The merits of loneliness has discussed by some people in the society includes first the opportunity to save money. This means that since an individual is not responsible for anything, then the opportunity to spend less and save more arises. For example, an individual who is not married, dissociated from families and friends has little or no responsibility. Thus, such person is a mincer and accrues money in banks. Additionally, some psychologists believe that loneliness enables people to think, meditate, and concentrate on the present and future. Similarly, it affords a person to reiterate and plan on how to forge ahead and so on. To this group, loneliness is of the essence because of the clearly evident merits it has on introvert people.
However, some other people detest loneliness. The reason for this is because loneliness is seen as a very dangerous. One of the disadvantages of loneliness is depression. This is so conspicuous that virtually all suicidal deaths today have been to depression caused by loneliness. There are few reasons for loneliness examples include divorce, death of a loved one. When this happens, the normal reactionary measure is for the individual affected to withdraw from the society. This stage of withdrawal can lead to depression and eventually suicidal death.
In conclusion, I think loneliness has both merits and demerits. On the balance however, I am of the opinion that the demerits are more dangerous than the merits.

The continued rise in the world’s population is the greatest problem faced by humanity at the present time.
What are the causes of this continued rise?
Do you agree that it is the greatest problem faced by humanity?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
There is not a shred of doubt that the incessant increase in global population is the greatest challenge humanity faces today. Several causes such as medical advancement, poverty, lack of education and family planning, and so on, lie in the phenomenon. This essay agrees that the growing number of world’s population is the most pressing issue that the planet will suffer the full consequences of it.
There are various factors contribute to the booming population. Advancement in medical science has declined the mortality rate and has risen the birth rate. That is to say, it provides the effective ways to grapple with the epidemics, deadly diseases, infant mortality, and so forth. In addition, modern medicine also has led to a rise in the global average life expectancy. Apart from that, having many children is deemed as boon in many an illiterate society. Moreover, the family planning and modern method of birth control usually do not reach the poor populations of the community. As a result, they tend to have many children.
It goes without saying that our planet is now in crisis as its population is swelling constantly. It heralds the apocalyptic fate of our planet as it could spell social and environmental catastrophe. The increase in population has a ripple effect through the whole society. Since, the overpopulation may harm the balance between human needs and resources obtainable to entertain those needs. For example, when a country is overwhelmed by population, it intensifies the unemployment crisis as there fewer job opportunities to shore up the large number of population. To cap it all, the increasing population will harm the environment severely. It will give rise to vehicles and industries, which in turn will affect the quality of air badly as CO2 emissions will be risen.
In fine, the growing number of population is currently threatening humanity. Most of the severe problems we face today are underlain with the increasing number of population. Therefore, we have to curb the rising trend of population in order to save our planet.

Today women work full time as well as men. Therefore, men should help them in doing household tasks.
Do you agree or disagree?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
With the emancipation of women, they want to stand on their own feet so as to be self-sustaining individual. They tend to shoulder the responsibility of a breadwinner as women are working full time in tandem with their counterpart. At the same time, regrettably, they also shoulder the burden of household chores. In the case, I completely agree that men should lend women a hand with household duties.
Men should help women in household tasks in order to nurture a harmonious relationship. When a husband helps with the chores, the wife then feels a sense of contentment and camaraderie, which in turn helps them stay together. For instance, many recent studies reveal that divorce rates are likely lower, couples are happier, the relationship has less conflict if husbands do their share of the domestic chores. So, men ought to pull weight more.
Likewise, involving in household responsibilities also benefits to both the father and the children. When fathers involve in childcare that helps them be more patient and empathic, and it also declined the rates of substance abuse in the boys. In addition to this, it also sweep away the gender stereotypes associate with the household chores. That is to say, fathers who lend mothers a hand with the domestic chores demonstrate to daughters that they should not confine themselves to stereotypically female tasks.
In pithy, notwithstanding the dramatic changes in gender norms in the modern world, there is one area where men still reluctant to make any significant change: household tasks. All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume that men should help women with the chores.

These websites may even provide charts which compare features for similar products to enable the online shopper to make an accurate comparison of two or more items before making a purchase. For women it is convenient because they do not have to drag their kids during shopping. The shoppers do not need to carry the items home as the merchants take the hassle of shipment.
While online shopping is giving a lot of comfort and made the life easier but some precaution must be taken by the consumers to make it beneficial, as the customers could not touch the goods and make decision of purchasing by viewing pictures of the product only there is a chance that the product would turn out to be lower in quality, replacing or getting servicing is tough, and error could be in billing process.
The consumers should try to visit only popular websites rather than following any advertising website so consumers should keep all that point in mind during online shopping.
Online shopping is ease to access for only educated person, illiterate person cannot get benefit from it. Well with all its pros and cons, online shopping is still a good option and should be enhance in the future.

Some people think that a car is the best way to travel in cities while others believe a bicycle is a better way. 
Discuss both views and give your opinion.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer : 
People tend to use both cars and bicycle in today’s modern cities. However, when it comes the question of whether car is better or bicycle, they are divided in their opinion. In the instance, both modes of commuting have their merits and demerits, I prefer bicycle.
To start with, people prefer car over bicycle for multifarious reasons. First of all, people choose car because it is more convenient to drive where they want to go, no matter if it is short or long distance, or sunny or rainy day. Secondly, cars have comfortable, spacious capacity and all the modern facilities. That is to say that they can travel with family by car and can enjoy music, videos, etc. in an air-conditioned environment whereas only two people can travel if they ride bicycle. Thirdly, in this consumerist world, with cars, people wear their status on the road. Everyone distinguishes them from others. For example, a friend of mine recently learned a thing about rolling status symbols when he purchased Mercedes E-Class Sedan. He drove the new car and immediately got many comments from colleagues and others like, “nice car, you must be doing good”.
However, an increasing number of people tend to ride bicycle in the recent years. First and foremost, more and more people are becoming aware of global warming. Bicycle does not emit toxic fumes into the atmosphere. In addition to this, it eliminates the oil, fuels, and hydraulic fluids dripped by cars onto the road surface. This means that bicycle produces no meaningful pollution when in operation. Secondly, there is also an awareness of health that regular commuting by bicycle may help lose weight and improve overall health. That is to say that people could easily burn 600 calories an hour through brisk cycling though it depends on individual riding style and city road condition. Another advantage of bicycle is that it needs less space to park than car. People can easily store a dozen bicycles in a single car-sized parking place. Considering these issues, I contend that bicycle is the smart choice right now.
In a word, there is not a single shade of doubt that both modes have pros and cons. After discussing in details, I have come to the point that we should remove cars from the driveways and start covering pavement on two wheels.

Many children today find it difficult to concentrate or pay attention at school. What could you think are the main causes? What are the possible solutions?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
It seemed that many children have difficulties with focusing and paying attention at school. This is because our modern lifestyle and the role it plays in the lifestyle of today’s kid. That is to say that the children live in a world that moves faster than ever before. They are exposed to cutting-edge technologies, more media images, faster sound bites, and are able to use multiple media outlets simultaneously. Thereby, they can no longer pay attention to a particular task for long time.
There is not a single shade of doubt that the world of today’s kids is fast-paced and ever-changing. It jumps around from sound to sound, image to image, thought to thought, never lingering long in one idea or thought. There is no break in the stream of ideas, images, sounds, or conversations. There is no breathing moment. In the classroom where the kids are expected to sit still and concentrate on a single thought, matter, person, or image for a long stretch of time is a major downshift for the children. For instance, many recent studies revealed that 70 percent kids, who are exposed to more technology, have difficulties with concentrating or paying attention. This is really an awfully high number.
Attention has a highly malleable quality and most directly induced by the atmosphere in which it is used. That is why, it is parents’ responsibility to ensure a conducive environment so that the children can practice how to pay attention. To do so, parents should establish a routine. When kids know that they are expected spend at least 30 minutes after getting home from school on studying, school projects or homework, they are less likely to be distracted by all the things they feel more interest. Besides, parents should make sure that their kids know when they are expected to be still and quiet. Apart from that, clearing television, laptop, smart phone and other distractions out of the room is an effective way to reinforce kids’ attention.
To sum up, the fast-paced lifestyle is a double-edged sword as it has both pros and cons. The bottom line of my argument is that parents should properly handle their children that when to stop them and when to set them free.

The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer: 
Traffic congestion is a pressing problem in the most cities around the world. There is a correlation between traffic congestion and the volume of commuters who travel to work, school, and shopping as an indispensable part of daily life. If we can reduce the need to travel to work, school and shopping, it would be the silver bullet the plague. Following discussions could explain how.
First of all, we can arguably shrink the need for travelling to work. Does it sound ridiculous? Let me clarify a bit more. Telecommuting can cut down the necessity of travelling to work. Telecommuting refers to that an employee can perform his duties at a convenient location away from the conventional office with the help of Internet and other electronic gadgets. This means that now people can easily work for home. So, there is no longer need to rush to office and eventually, can causes less traffic on the road.
Likewise, online education system could be another remedy to the traffic gridlock. Enrolling in an online degree, students can receive same high quality education as students who attend classes in a conventional fashion. Students can get lectures and can complete projects or assignments online from home although they would be need to drive to campus occasionally. Which by consequence, they can contribute to curb the traffic jams. That is to say that there is less vehicles results in less traffic congestion.
Similarly, online business could a nice tool battle against traffic problems. Let me give an example, eCommerce has already made selling and buying online possible from almost anywhere around the globe and has decreased the need for physical shops. So, people now can purchase products online from home. That is how they can avoid traveling to shops.
To wrap up, city-embodies hope for the future and provide significant opportunities for economic growth. And it goes without saying that city urban mobility is key component of economic growth. The above mentioned solutions could lessen the need for traveling from home for work, education, and shopping which is greatly responsible for traffic congestion. Now needless to say, it is the only key to calm traffic jams.

In many cities there is a lack of space to live and as a result, in order to modernise old buildings are demolished and replaced with new buildings.
What are disadvantages of knocking down old buildings? Do the advantages over-weigh its disadvantages?
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
With explosion of population, there is dire crisis for space to live in many cities. Thereby, the older buildings are being torn down to construct new ones. Though some old buildings are significant for its aesthetic or archeological values, I think it is quite rational to make more space to live.
To start with, old buildings represent a particular era and some of them have great aesthetic, archeological or architectural worth. They provide an insight into the history of the city that how the ancestors live centuries ago. And most importantly, they are symbolized either as an integral part of culture or unique in the realm of architecture. Demolishing of these buildings means harming the cultural heritage. Besides, these structures might be the source of tourism.
However, the old buildings that some people want to conserve are not worth saving. In fact, the cities would benefit much more if the old structures are demolished and have high rise modern buildings, shopping malls, etc. in the places of old buildings. By replacing old structures with skyscrapers, we can provide home for more people occupying the same area of land. This reduces pressure on cultivated land. This means that it not only solves the housing problem, but also leaves more lands for harvesting crops. Aside from that, new shopping malls would boost the economy of the town and could create new job opportunities as well. That is to say that pulling down old building may enhance overall lifestyle of the city.
In pithy, the decision as to whether or not the old structures should be knocked down can be a tough one, and in most cases, many different aspects will need to be considered prior to any structure taking place. However, based on above discussion it can be concluded that the advantages of demolishing old building for new modern structures are far more advantageous than keeping the old ones.

Some people say that mobile phones should be banned in public places such as libraries, shops and public transport. 
Do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Mobile phones have brought revolution in the world of personal communication, but also have become a pain in the neck as many people argue that these handy gadgets are turning out to be more nuisance than being convenient, and hence, people should be restrained from using them in public places like libraries, shops, and public transport, although there are some who feel otherwise. While I value their concern, but I think banning mobile phones in the public places would not be sensible decision.
To start with, people very often lose their sense while talking on this small device. That is to say that they become oblivious of their surroundings and are lost in their own kingdom. Actually, a psychological transformation takes place when people are talking on the mobile phones as they fail to control their impulse, and react instantly to the conversation running on the phone, and often the reactions may loud. This causes severe inconvenience for the people around. So, talking on cellular phones may easily annoy other students in the library or other commuters on the bus or train. On the top of that, the signal of these phones can cause problems in some places, especially in hospitals by barging into the delicate equipment.
On the other hand, there is not a single shade of doubt that these cell phones are utterly important in the case of emergency in public place. Let me share my experience. Last month, our staff bus was crashed by other bus. I called 911, informed office, massaged to my family. We could save many lives due to being able to call the ambulance immediately. This could be possible only for this tiny gadget. Moreover, it is an amazing tool to be connected with family, friends, and employers when out in public. Furthermore, it could be a great source of entertainment in a tedious travelling, especially in the traffic gridlock situation as it has umpteen apps and games. To avoid negative impact on public places, we can easily turn it to silent or vibration mode so that it cannot bother the people around.
To wrap up, mobile has become an indispensable part of modern life. It is a great boon to us. If we can use these phones sensibly, we are able to minimize its negative impacts. So, I feel there is no need to ban mobile phones in the public places.

Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
As a teacher at a school in one of the poorest province in India, I have seen poor money management skills and misplaced priorities of low income people. A vast number of my students are from poor backgrounds. Many of them have smart phones and tablets. Many regularly eat at fast food restaurants and bring fast foods. I have noticed them spending money on luxuries while they are not able to meet their basic necessity. As financial education was the tipping point for me to get my finances on track, I firmly believe that it should be a compulsory of the school programs.
The economic condition the students live in, the need for financial education among them is as crucial as the traditional subjects. In school, they learn the traditional subjects of English, Mathematics, Physics, History, and Geography, all important subjects. But I am sure you all agree with me that the knowledge of personal finance is lot more important than learning about Newton’s third law. At this moment, what is crucial for them is skill of financial management. Besides, no matter what sector or field they will work in, they will have to deal with their own personal finances.
Again, students should be the most important target audience for financial education. Students are important because if they have financial education at an early age when they are not yet managing their own money (in most cases), they can become financially literate adults. Actually, salad days are the prime time to hone the financial management skills essential for the future instead of having to redress poor financial decisions.
In fine, financial education is utterly important for students in this consumerist world. The education may fetch considerable improvements in their financial situation as it does for me.

Should criminals be punished with lengthy jail terms or re-educated and rehabilitated using community service programs for instance, before being reintroduced to society?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer: 
Nobody is born as a criminal. Circumstances and situations often make a person to be a criminal. However, when it comes to issue that how we should treat these criminals, people are divide in their opinions.Some people opine that the criminals deserve to be punished with a longer jail sentence, but others, on the other hand, seem soft on criminals that they want to train the criminals so as to hone their skills and competencies, and to engage the criminals in community service programmes so that they can contribute to the society. From my way of thinking, I believe that they should get chance so they can be a responsible member of the society contributing positively
Re-educating and rehabilitating of criminals using community service programs is an excellent policy instead of confining them to jail for long term. This means working to make a perpetrator functioning member of society. Not only can the policy transform a perpetrator into responsible member of the society, but also it can contribute to the society tangibly. Let me clarify a bit more. Community service programs are court-ordered volunteer works. It offers offenders, through unpaid work on community, an opportunity to repair some of the harms caused by their criminal activities and which benefits neighbourhoods, communities, voluntary, local schools, community and charitable organizations.
Again, human behavior is subject to the same law as many other natural phenomena. That is to say that our customs, values, and behavior are the byproducts of our atmosphere. No one is born with hatred, prejudice, bigotry, greed, honesty and patriotism. These are all acquired from the surroundings. If we can alter the environment, these perpetrators may lead their life to the opposite direction. And in the case, community service programs could be the key to unlock the door of change.
To sum up, lengthy jail terms or re-educated and rehabilitated are basically the two streams of thoughts on what the goal of criminal sentencing ought to be: justice for the victim, which is generally used to mean the punishment for the offenders, and rehabilitation for the criminal which means transforming him as a good citizen. I think second one is the right choice we should make.


Present a written argument to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic:
Should developing countries concentrate on improving industrial skills or should they promote education first?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Sample Answer:
Developing nations are struggling for their progress and development across the globe. With limited resources, they have to allocate wisely so that they can make best use of their limited resources. In doing so, they face a very tough question whether they should focus on industrial skills or should flourish education first. In this instance, I am of the honest opinion that they should give priority to education over industrial skills. The following reasons could explain why.
To commence with, it goes without saying that the pandemic poverty is the main hindrance for development in most developing country. And quality human resource is a handy tool for combating against poverty, no doubt. But quality human resource could only come from quality education. Take compulsory financial education for primary and secondary level for all students as an example. As a resident of a poor community, I have observed poor financial management skills and misplaced priorities of the impoverished community. For that, most people cannot improve their life standard despite they are good at their occupations. However, needless to say that every nation has to go through several vicissitudes, and with only quality education, a nation can overcome all the obstacles.
On the flip side, many countries incline much on industrialization and trained their people to hone industrial skills concentrating less focus on education fail to develop themselves. They lag behind in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). They think that rapid industrialization is the silver bullet to their poverty. But in reality, they only manage to supply labour to their industries, but cannot improve their stark poverty. Hundreds of thousand people live below the poverty line. Education, therefore, is the key to the developing countries.
In fine, quality education is the precondition of all skills. So, first thing should come first that the developing countries should put emphasize on education first, then industrial skills.

More and more qualified people are moving from poor to rich countries to fill vacancies in specialist areas like engineering, computing, and medicine. Some people believe that by encouraging the movement of such people rich countries are stealing from poor countries. Others feel that this is only part of the natural movement of workers around the world. 
What is your opinion?
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
It goes without saying that brain drain is a pressing problem for many developing countries. Every year, umpteen numbers of talents (such as engineer, computer programmer, and doctors) are migrating from poor nations to rich nations. As there is a worry about skills scarcities, rich world entice talents to study there and remain there after earning degree. So, there is no room for disagreeing that wealthy nations are stealing talents from poor countries.
In the developed world, there is a great concern about the skills shortages, particularly at the upper levels of their economies. Several factors lie in the matter. Demographic cliff in some European countries and Japan, notably decreasing the number of university-age people, especially fewer students are enrolling in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields to name just a few. This scenario menaces the rich world that they are going to face acute skills crisis.
However, they have found a solution to the problem. They intentionally boost the stay rate of international students. In other words, they lure international students, particularly from middle-income and developing countries, to stay after they accomplish their degrees. For example, most of the Indians and Chinese who have earned advanced degrees in U.S over almost a half-century have not come back to their homeland. Rich nations, actually, have made strategies to entice the best and brightest of professionals from poor nations, whom they educate, to remain and join the local work force. They liberalise visa regulations, open job opportunities, easy degree recognition, permit postgraduate work, and many other policies are being implemented.
In pithy, many argue that it is quite natural that people move to where they find better opportunity. It is okay but the facts testimony that the wealthy nations are making gimmick to solve their possible crisis.

University students nowadays have too much freedom and do not study enough. To what extent do you agree and disagree?
Explain your opinion, using specific reasons and examples.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
University students can enjoy a considerable freedom these days. In the high school they have a schedule. They need to show up in the classes regularly, whereas, in the university if you do not show up, university administration cares not that much. Nobody is checking up on them. And some people contend that with this freedom university students do not study enough. In the case, there is now way to differ. Following reasons could explain why?
In the past, university students were needed to study diligently and they attended promptly and participated properly at lectures, classes, seminars, courses, and so forth. And if they did not conform, they were agreeing to be expelled or otherwise punished. But now the thing has change considerably due to the attitude. Today’s view is that it should not be an extension of school, with tight schedule, and set of customs and tradition to follow. And it is believed that university should be a place that releases intellect and spirit, not confine them to a gloomy code of conduct and hard work. This results in more opportunity for them to spend time on their own. Thereby, but a significant number of students does not study like before. For example, recently, the University of California published a report in which it reveals that the average student at four-year-college in 1961 studied about 24 hours a week, while today’s average student opens the books for just 14 hours.
On the other hand, students’ horizon of spending time has stretched dramatically. The allure of electronic gadget (gaming device, smart phone, laptop, tablet) and internet (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) keep them away from studying. On the top of them, students are forced to involve in part time jobs due to the recession. University students, thus, spend less time on academic activities.
Based on above reasons, it is easily said that university students today are spending less time studying than they did in the past as they more freedom. Therefore, we should solve the problem as soon as possible.

People in the past used to be more dependent on one another, whereas nowadays they lead a more independent life. 
Do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Nowadays, no one would deny that society has changed radically than the past. In the past, people were interlinked with each other than the today’s “I” society. Individualism is the linchpin of the present society. The strand places emphasis on individual interest was the emergence of capitalism as an economic order that stressed the individual both as the responsible of self-interest and as the foundation of all legal rights. Consequently, people tend to be aliened from others and seek liberty for their own interest.
To start with, individualism can be treated the doctrine that the interest of individual ought to take priority of the interest of social group or state. The champions of individualism argue free and independent action of individual as oppose to state or any other interference. That is to say that on external authority or force is supposed to determine to individual’s actions within society unless he is impeding the freedom of others. This in turn results in the autonomous individual is the yardstick of all things.
Similarly, people tend to lead more independent life due their neoliberal ideology. It is an ideology that construes profit making as the kernel of democracy and consuming as the only functional form of citizenship. It also provides the logic for a pile of private interests to curb as much as possible of economic, political, and social life so that they can maximize their personal profit. To do so, people are desperate to lead an independent life ignoring responsibilities towards others or society. Thus, the very fabric of society has changed fundamentally and people are becoming egoistic and are alienating from other bindings.
In fine, the discussion has already revealed that the norms and values belonged to our ancestors has eroded significantly caused by structural shift into our society. In the contemporary society, people are deliberately confining themselves to a stark private life away from family, friends and society in order to achieve personal goals.

The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to make all young drivers complete a safe driving education course before being licensed to drive.
How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Every year, millions of people are wounded in road accidents involving cars and other vehicles. And many studies reveal that young drivers are far more likely to be involved in accidents than their adult counterpart. Consequently, in many classes, it is argued that the best approach to curb the number of crashes is to make all young drivers complete a safe driving education course before getting license to drive. In my opinion, I agree with the notion. Following reasons could explain why?
Young drivers have extremely high crash rate. This is because of their inexperience, youthful bravado, and sheer recklessness. On the top of that, many youngsters are simply bereft of traffic rules. One friend of mine is a prime example here. He has involved in several crashes. As I observed him closely, I know he has no knowledge of driving and traffic rules. Therefore, driving education course should be mandatory for youngsters before being licensed to drive.
Actually, driving education course provides the young drivers with knowledge of road rules and conditions. They can learn how to control speed, learn traffic signs and lights as these are main reasons for common traffic accidents. Most importantly, they can hone advance driving competence like, driving at night, hazardous situations, towing and other unwanted situations. In addition to this, behavioral issue of teenagers is another main factor for traffic accidents. That is why, behavior change is what we really need it. Driving education course can counsel them how to control their untamed impulsion.
To conclude, based on above reasons, it can be easily said that driving education is the key to quell the road crashes involved by youngsters. Therefore, I would like to say that driving education course should be compulsory for teenagers before getting license to drive.

Many people believe that women make better parents than men and that this is why they have a greater role in raising children in most societies. Others claim that men are just as good as women at parenting.
Write an essay expressing your point of view.
Sample Answer: 
Parenting is the noblest task on earth. But when it comes to the point whether men or women are better parents, people are split in their opinion. Some people think women play a paramount role in most society as they raise children far better way than their counterparts. On other hand, others believe that father can rear their offspring as good as mothers. To my point of view, mothers are better than fathers at parenting.
First of all, mothers have a magical allure of temperament that is impossible to find in fathers’ traits. In fact, the allure cannot be expressed in words. It is feeling that makes children so comfortable. There is always something in mothers’ touch. For example, in my childhood, when I was injured, there is something about my mother’s touch that seemed to make the injury just felt better.
Secondly, mothers are usually less aggressive than fathers. Apart from that, they can generally understand and communicate with children in a better way. Women, actually, have an intuitive skill that they feel the needs of their children, even if they do not express it. Mothers usually hear their children patiently, which in turn makes more intimate bond than fathers. This bond helps mother guide their children effectively and they can instill values into their children.
Finally, girls have been trained since their childhood. Let me elaborate a bit more. They learn about nurturing through the playing with dolls and later through taking care of younger sisters or brothers. Thus, they have been playing the role of caregiver from the early stage. This advantage offers women the edge over men.
In short, there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that mothers are the best parents. Certain inherent traits help women appear to be ahead of men when it comes to the issue of parenting.

Nowadays many people work part or full time from home. Some people say that working from home has many benefits while others disagree.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer: 
Engaging on home based part-time or full time jobs as well as online jobs have long been the norm in the society. While others see this as a more favorable career, I firmly believe that it is a better option to have regular employment jobs.
There are several benefits for employees working away from home. Firstly, good communication and social skills will be developed through interaction with other co-workers and clients. As a result, confidence of workers will be boosted which may also benefit the employer. Secondly, people will also gain new friends which might help them discover different things. For instance, monthly meetings and daily work routines will be a good way to develop teamwork. These employees will benefit with each other as compared to those workers at home. Lastly, good budgeting will be given much attention due to the expenses for fare, food, clothes for work and for leisure activities with co-workers.
On the contrary, home based jobs also have advantages for some individuals. Parents will have more time with their children and can also do multi-tasking at home. An example of this is while a worker is talking to his client, he can monitor his young ones. As it is known by many, this is also a hassle free occupation because one will not experience heavy traffic, bad weather or even wait for a vehicle to go to work. Another good side is that there are higher chances of saving funds for basic necessities. An instance of this is they will not spend too much money as opposed to those with regular jobs. Although this is advantageous, I solely disagree with this kind of job.
Hence, despite the good conditions of home-based jobs, it is still beneficial to work as a regular employee.

In a country where unemployment is very high, there should be only primary education.  There is no need for secondary education as there is no hope for them in future.
Give your opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Many countries around the world are grappling with the problem of unemployment. Some people argue for redefining education in the developing world. To the despair of unemployment, they suggest that primary education is sufficient for them and secondary education is not worth investment. In the instance, I completely disagree with the idea of pessimists who try to downplay the significance of secondary education.
For a start, Empirical evidence shed light on the importance of secondary education. The countries suffer from unemployment because of lack of higher education. Most cases, children attend primary school and drop out before secondary level. Elementary education cannot equip children with the skills and competences they need in the job field. Consequently, they cannot enter into the labour market due to the lack of adequate skills. So, in order to change the status quo, the governments have to emphasize secondary education.
However, to get a desirable result, the governments should introduce a new educational model of secondary level. The unemployment-ridden nations have to develop the robust model couples traditional content with entrepreneurship and health modules. Let me elaborate a bit more. What I want to suggest is that entrepreneurship and health modules have to be mandatory curriculum of secondary level. Besides, student-centred learning should be employed in the classroom where students would work in groups to solve critical problems and manage projects on their own. In addition, the conceptual knowledge should be put into practice through activities at secondary level so that the students can apply what they have learned.
Summing all of the above, the unemployment crisis reinforces the importance of secondary education. To that end, the government should restructure of secondary education combining conventional courses with health and entrepreneurship modules.

It has been said, “Not everything that is learned is contained in books.” Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
It goes without saying that we are learning and developing ourselves throughout our life. We gain knowledge not only from books but also from our daily experience. While knowledge from books is important, I believe knowledge that we gain from our empirical experience is more important. Following reasons could explain why.
To start with, experience is a stunning tool with which we can judge the knowledge gained from books is authentic or not. However, books are wonderful source of knowledge. It provides us with essential knowledge that is crucial for living a better life. The most significant feature of books is that they accumulate all the knowledge gained from generation to generation. We can gain myriad knowledge from books including science, math, history, physics, literature, philosophy, and so on. We can understand and justify what the books really mean through our own experience and practice. For example, once people learnt from books that our planet is flat, but the scientists found it wrong later through measurement and observation.
In contrast, I believe that “the truth comes from practice and experience”. We can accomplish knowledge from our experience as much as those from books. For example, a few hundred years ago, people thought that the sun travels around the earth, but later Nicolaus Copernicus proved that was wrong through his experience and observation. He concluded that the earth goes around the sun. Knowledge is being producing incessantly through our daily experience and practice, and some of the knowledge could never be found in books. Books have limitations that they only confine to past issues, but our experience and practice produces cutting-edge knowledge that leads to further development of mankind.
However, we can gain knowledge mainly from two channels, books and experience. Each plays different roles for us. In my opinion, I believe that knowledge from experience is more important than from books. This is because it not only tailors current demands, but also corrects previous mistakes.
In pithy, experience helps us discovering new things and assessing the trustworthiness of a phenomenon. I, therefore, believe that knowledge from experience is more significant that those from books.

Sample Answer:
When it comes to road safety, some people argue that the most effective way to improve road safety is to increase the minimum legal age for driving cars or riding motorbikes. In my opinion, I think the age limit for the drivers and motorbike uses should be increased in order to elevate road safety.
To start with, increasing the minimum age requirement for driving is a good idea. First and foremost, the motorcycles are killer machines and that its riders, usually teenagers, are more vulnerable than accidents of cars because of their two-wheel design. And it is also seen that youngsters often drive rashly that leads to accidents. This is because they are not mature enough and the lack of experience is also serious fact for accidents. Secondly, age between 15 to 17 years, teenager’s body and mind are changing rapidly and they have many distractions that they cannot concentrate in one task. This may result in deadly accident. Therefore, there would be fewer accidents if the legal age limit for driving is raised to 18 years. Again, teenagers are reckless drivers and driving at a high speed and doing competition each other on the high way are quite common among them.
However, I would like to argue that there are other better approaches to reduce road accidents. We can substantially reduce traffic accidents by the means of stiff punishment for traffic offenders. This would be effective in two ways. First of all, once a strict law is imposed and, it prevents people’s attempt to make an offense second time. Secondly, when a person is punished severely is considered as a mirror at which other people may look and they try to avoid the same incidents.
Based on above discussion, it is easily said that there are some effective measures along with age bar. The other ways should be considered in order to ensure road safety.

Reducing global environmental damage should be handled by governments rather than individuals.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Global environmental damage is the most pressing problem in the world nowadays. However, when it comes to tackle the problem, people are divided in their opinions. In many circles, it is argued that governments’ role is crucial in reducing the environmental damage, while others put emphasis on individuals’ attempt. While I accept the notion that individuals can reduce environmental damage, I believe the governments can play a paramount role in improving environmental damage.
Environmental damage can be slowed and stopped with practical actions that yield a healthier, cleaner atmosphere. Actually, it is up to each of us, as individual, to take steps to slow down and eventually stop the damages through everyday awareness of our energy use, and pay attention to the ways we can save electricity and minimize fossil fuel usage. For example, using electricity to lighting our home, driving a car, heating our room and throwing away trash all lead to greenhouse gas emission that causes environmental damage severely. We can reduce emissions through simple actions like switching to energy-efficient lighting, improving the efficiency of home appliances, reducing energy required for heating, improving vehicle fuel-efficiency, and so on.
But, the governments could certainly make more effort to reduce environmental damage. They could pass laws to limit the emission from factories and industries and gradually they can force to the companies to use renewable energy from solar, water, or wind power. In addition to this, the government can set forth a national blueprint for a clean energy economy. Actually, they can outline a national climate action plan that puts emphasize on several key ways to reduce environmental damages. Apart from that, since environmental damage is a global issue, they can work for an effective international climate treaty negotiation so that international efforts can be ensured in reducing environmental damages worldwide.
To reiterate, as individuals we can contribute by taking steps to reduce our personal carbon emissions. But fully address the threat of global environmental damage, we must need actions from the government to support and implement a comprehensive set of climate solutions.

More people are following latest fashion these days. What are the factors influencing them? Is it good or bad?
Write examples from your knowledge or experience to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Fashion, in common parlance, refers to the term for a popular vogue or practice, particularly in clothing, footwear or accessories. Nowadays, more and more people tend to follow latest fashion trends. This is because they want to create a elegant impression to other people. I think the attitude is very useful for this modern world.
To start with, when it comes to fashion everyone wants to look like a celebrity and hence tends to follow the fashion choices of his favourite celebrities; especially the female celebrities have great influence on teenage girls. For example, my sister always tries to follow the fashion of Paris Hilton. She mimics the way Hilton dresses up, and even the way she walks and talks. Another important thing that influences the fashion trend for people is their comfort zone. Whether it is a formal wear or casual one they want to put on a dress that makes them look stunning, but at the same time it should be comfortable to wear. In this instance, the latest fashion trends always focus on comfort area so that people could be influenced easily.
However, I believe that fashion distinguishes a man from others. And a good fashion choice can set a man apart from the others. In addition to distinguishing oneself, a person is also able to derive confidence by maintain current fashion trends. Confidence refers to how a person perceives himself more than what others perceive such a man. In my case, when I wear the most stylist cloths as they are part of the latest collection, I feel more confident. This enables me to speak with some air of authority when holding conversation with friends or even during public speaking.
In fine, people follow current fashion trends because it makes them look glamorous to others and it makes them to be on trend with the latest vogue. People do not want to look ugly and want to represent them in a stylish manner. So, to vogue the current fashion is what we should do and there is nothing wrong with it.

It is compulsory for children to attend school between the ages of 5 and 16. Many people are in favor of raising the age at which children must start their schooling to 6 or 7, and age at which they are allowed to stop to 17 or 18. people of this view believe it is important for young children to spend more time with their parents, while they believe teenagers would gain more from staying in school longer.
To what extent do you agree with this view?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Undeniably, it is the basic question in the mind of parents and society that what is the appropriate age of schooling? While our country generally follows the conventional trend of 5 to 16, many countries are adopting new concept of 6 or 7 to 17 or 18. According to my view, later is more beneficial for children both academically and socially.
It is a well proven fact that early formative years are extremely important for the emotional and social development of a child. More years at home certainly deepens the emotional bonding of a child with parents, siblings and other family members. Moreover, they get better awareness about their culture and give family more time to teach moral and socially acceptable values. In addition, these days even parents are capable of teaching basic education. Finally, I strongly believe that it is highly unethical to burden young ones with educational responsibility at an early age.
Likewise, spending transformative and turbulent teen age in school shall be advantageous, as they are immature to take decisions, if exposed to universities at the age of 16. Can they handle ragging at such an age? Would they be able to challenge the peer pressure? And will they be able to prevent themselves from socially unacceptable behaviour like alcoholism, drug addiction and many more? These are the fundamental questions we need to ask ourselves, as many lives have been ruined like this.
To conclude, both early childhood and late adolescent are vital period for a student, hence we should adopt this transformation bravely for the betterment of the children and nation.

The government spends enormous amount of money on renovation of old buildings in large cities. Some believe that this money is better spent on building new houses and road development.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this argument?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Infrastructure development and maintenance of old building are two aspects which always perplex government across the globe. It seems that maintenance of old construction has a traditional and culture value which is indispensable for society, but, it is also significant to the development of new buildings and roads as well.
I see many reasons in support of new construction. Firstly, world population growth is increasing at a maximum rate which requires the construction of more buildings and roads. There is a race among countries for the fast and contemporary development of infrastructure. For example, China has highest infrastructure development compared to other nations in last decade. Secondly, modern infrastructure lasts much longer than older ones. This is because of new technology used for the development and also the use of sturdy material which has been tried and tested. Modern technology not only enhances the longevity of building, but also offers modern means of living.
Thirdly, newer buildings are created by keeping the needs of people and also a future trend in mind. Hence, it gives far better facilities compared to what older buildings can. Finally, better infrastructure always help to grow economy. Thus, it is the need of the hour for all governments.
On the other hand, there are certain building hold religious, culture and tradition value of the countries, which should be carried out to our next generation and so it is extremely important to spend a large chunk of money for their restoration and maintenance.
In closing, I admit that certain construction need to be maintained. However, apart from them, it is not sensible for the government to spend their revenue on old construction. I assert that new development should be given first priority.

Do you think there should be international news as a subject in primary education?
Some think it is a waste of time. Give your opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Today, more than ever before, students must be somewhat aware of what is happening outside of their national boundary. Some educationists suggest that it is better to start learning about global news from primary level, while others believe that it would be a vain attempt. To my way of thinking, international news should become a course of secondary level rather than of primary level.
At primary level, children need to learn basic subjects such as mother tongue, mathematics, science, and ethics which are crucial for them to survive in the future, particularly at the outset of their academic career. Apart from that, children are not mature enough to comprehend global news, as they have no idea of geo-politics, economics, trade and commerce. Besides, they are already shouldered many elementary, essential subjects. Learning about international news would make them feel overloaded and distract them from study causing negative feelings towards learning.
On the other hand, studying international news can enhance the students’ ability to analyse the global situation because when they follow an event, for example, about a political rift between two nations, they could understand how the tension develops or escalates, how the international organizations act, and what are the consequences brought by the conflict. In this interconnected world, it is utterly essential for students as they are the future leader of the world. But the question is at which lever they should involve in international matter. In the case, I believe that secondary level is the best as it is not early or too late. Furthermore, at the level, the students possess some geographical, economical, and political knowledge; thereby they could understand global issues. But at primary level, it would a waste of time, I think.
Summing all of the above, I incline to the opinion that global news as a subject in elementary level would be a waste of time, as the children hardly know about the geo-politics. That is why, it seems to me that secondary level would be good for them.

To balance work and personal life is often difficult to implement. What are the causes of the problems? How can it be overcome?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Modern life is heavily laden with works that people very often find it difficult to balance professional and personal life. Several factors, such as work pressure, aspiration, and necessity, lie in the matter. However, people should maintain a balanced life by changing their attitude about life.
Today, life has become a race and everybody competes with others. Employees often take work pressure willingly in order to impress employers or have the edge over their competitors. In fact, they overestimate their ability. The excessive tasks or projects turn to stress and they tend to compromise with their personal life. Naturally, when one does not have a healthy life balanced with professional and personal life, he then sooner or later will get burnt out. On the top of that, sometimes, some employees aggressively want to reach the top of corporate ladder, thereby the aspiration translates into greed. Consequently, they work very hard as much as possible, and eventually they struggle to cope with the heavy workload.
However, executives should bear in mind that the stress of workload could interfere with their productivity, and their physical and emotional health. So, they should lead a healthy life balancing professional life with personal. First of all, executives ought to create balanced schedule. They need to find a balance between professional and family life, social activities, leisure time. In addition to this, they should take regular breaks throughout the day. In fact, these short breaks will relax them, which by consequence will increase their productivity. Secondly, people should prioritize tasks. What they need to do is to make a list of task they have to do, and then tackle them according to importance.
In pithy, nowadays, people are grappling with imbalance between work and personal life. Aspiration sometimes provides the spur to take work pressure excessively, and they could burn out eventually. In order to get rid of this situation, they should manage time and task skillfully.

Many old buildings are protected by the government. Some people think that the old buildings should be knocked down to create new office and houses. Is history becoming an obstacle in the path of progress? 
Discuss the importance of old buildings?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Nowadays, the government is taking initiatives to preserves historical buildings and monuments. In many circles, it is argued that the old structures should be demolished for building imposing edifices. They contend that these buildings are impeding our progress. To my way of thinking, historical buildings and monuments are of vital importance.
First of all, historical property plays a cultural role. By preserving old architecture, we are able to manifest the aesthetic and historical culture of our nation. In other words, historical structures cultivate a sense of pride and heritage which has made us unique in the world. Apart from that, some architecture have specific historical backdrop and have to be conserved exactly. This is because present and future generation can learn so many things from these historical sites. Most importantly, the old buildings and monuments can fuel the sense of identity.
Secondly, historical buildings preservation can be a powerful key to sustaining local economy, generating myriad job opportunities and even capital. That is to say, many empirical evidences show that historical properties can boost hotel and tourism industry as they are great attractor of tourists. The industry involves in many different sectors, so it also can create so many job prospects in different sectors. Besides, it may also attract huge investment from overseas.
Finally, conservation and restoration is also good for environment. To give an illustration of what I mean, let’s consider process of building new structures that requires huge energy on the one hand, and many things simply go to waste on the other. By preserving old buildings, we can reduce construction waste and the energy consumption that is usually used to manufacture and transport building materials.
To recapitulate, historical properties conserved by the government possess a great significance. It is worthwhile to culture and heritage, economy, and environment. Besides, the conservation of old buildings and monuments are a one-way street. There is no way to renovate or to save a historic property once it has torn down. To cap it all, we can never be sure what will be valued in the future.

Cultural traditions are being used for money making purposes especially for tourists. Is this destroying the traditions or is it the only way to keep them alive?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
It is common today that cultural heritages and traditions have corresponding fees. Some people believe that it is detrimental to the host country but others think it is a positive light. While many see this as a threat, this process should be done continuously.
There are various benefits on why traditional cultures should be used for business purposes. Firstly, these fees may be used for maintaining the quality of the different traditions. For instance, tourists who might get interested may help the visited country through investments. Secondly, this will also raise social awareness of the common practices and beliefs of the state. In addition, detailed and concrete information will be introduced to foreign visitors which will help them understand the country’s common practices.
Subsequently, collected fees for each different historical and cultural traditions will prevent overcrowding due to the limited access of tourists. It is known that some of them lack respect to these heritages through littering and not following rules and regulations. An instance of these are visitors who do extraordinary things for the purpose of photography and also, others vandalize museums, paintings, or even walls and trees of the visited location.Another benefit is that limited tourists mean less needed resources like the transportation and facilities, this will help prevent pollution such as noise and air pollution which will help secure the significance of one’s culture.
Hence, while others think that the essence of the traditional cultures may be destroyed due to business purposes, I solely believe that the pursuance of this endeavor is a good option.

Some people think that studying history is a waste of time while others think it is essential to learn. 
Discuss both sides and give your opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
History, at its simplest, is the study of past events. It could be an account of a nation’s heroic event or of great man. It might be the study of a particular epoch or of a general situation at a given time in the past. However, some people consider that the study of history is not worth anything, while others believe it is worthwhile to study history. To my way of thinking, history performs an essential role in our present to mould a better future.
To begin with, the antagonists of history argue that history is worth nothing. They consider history to be irrelevant in our present life or in future. According to them, studying history means memorizing dates, names, and facts and this information is not congruent with the need of our present situation. Apart from that, people do not learn from history as they often do the same mistakes again and again, which shows the irrelevance of studying history for the future.
The proponents of history, on the other hand, argue that history has profound effect on our daily life. Studying history helps us to comprehend the present situation. History demonstrates us how we have changed over period, how human society has emerged and progressed. It shows us how the fashion and way of life of a society or of a nation have changed, although the fundamental principles, culture, and tradition have remained the same. Most importantly, history teaches us what to retain and what to discard. In my opinion, history inspires for moral contemplation. Studying the autobiography of great individuals or the stories of events in the past allows the students of history to examine their moral sense, to sharpen it so as to combat against the complexities individuals face in their difficult time.
In pithy, according to an ancient adage, “history is philosophy teaching by example”. People can learn many precious lessons from studying history. All things considered, it would reasonable enough to conclude that studying history is essential for our daily life and for our future.

Experts tend to believe that walking is the best exercise for health, however people walk less nowadays. Why you think is this happened?  How can people be encouraged for walking more?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer: 
When it comes to the best form of exercise, experts tend to argue that walking is the best. But people are less willing to walk these days due to the development of communication and transportation. They use some kinds of vehicles to move one place to another and in even shorter distance they are unwilling to walk. This has great affects on health. Therefore, we need to encourage people for walking more. We should enlighten them about the benefits of walking so that they start walking habit on a regular basis.
It seems that modern life is not made for walking. With the development of communication and economic progress, more and more people depend on vehicles like cars. The sophisticated vehicles have changed the way people live. Here U.S is a very good example. In the country, people drive to work, drive to grocery shop, and drive kids to their schools instead of walking by foot. In addition to this, people attitude has also changed considerably that they view walking as a slow, tiresome and outmoded fashion to get around.
However, people could be motivated to walk in several ways. First of all, we need to provide safe and accessible pedestrian so that people can feel that walking is a safe and pleasant way to get from home to work, from work to grocery shop or from home to park. Apart from this, we need to convince people that walking is one of the easiest forms of exercise that provides us with many health benefits. For example, it lends a glow to the face as it improves the blood circulation.
To recapitulate, although many health professionals argue that the best way for living healthy life is walking more, less and less people tend to choose walking as they have convenient transportation facilities. We, therefore, need to educate people about the benefits of walking so that they can lead a health life.

Some people say that online learning is the most effective and convenient way to learn. Others say that online learning will never be as effective as learning at a real school.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
At the present time, people often argue over which learning options will be the most successful way to learn. Some people tend to learn via the internet at home, while others are of the opposite opinion. This causes heated debate. I would argue that it is better for students studying in the traditional way.
On the one hand, there are several reasons why people believe by internet connection devices may gain many advantages. The first one is that online instruction offers the students in remote areas easy access to education. For example, Vietnamese students are able to study at a variety of American universities, including Harvard, Princeton which scholarship recipients only could go to. This type of learning is not time-consuming, and learners are able to save a significant amount of money because people do not need the private cost of schooling, including fees and contributions, school uniforms, textbooks… Furthermore, online instruction at home provides the learners a comfortable learning environment. This learning option allows students a flexible learning timetable. They are able to study at the appropriate time, and the lessons can be downloaded for later studying.
On the other hand, some others are holding view against and claim that traditional learning style is still the best choice for studying. There is no doubt that interactive environment plays an important role in motivating students to learn. Students in classrooms are able to work in groups, receive direct comments or detailed explanation from teachers which are impossible for online learning. However, knowledge is never enough for young learners. People may gain enormous benefits from Physical Education which is important for physical growth.
In conclusion, while there are some benefits of online instruction, I strongly believe that interactive learning is always the best way of education.

Sample Answer 2:
In the modern world, learning via Internet or at a real classroom has become a hotly debated issue. While many people believe that an online computer for learning is the best way to learn, others argue that going to classroom is more beneficial for them to acquire knowledge.
There are several reasons why a great majority of people believe learning at home through the Internet is the most successful method to learn. Firstly, it helps the learners have a flexible learning schedule. They are able to study everywhere and every time as well as arranging the most convenient time for their own targets. Besides, with a computer linked to the Internet, the learners may save a great deal of money from commuting back and forth to and from school. One more benefit of this learning type is that it provides a variety of learning options. People staying at home are able to easily access to new and modern teaching method from instructors across the country and around the world. This makes their learning process become more effective.
On the other hand, despite some merits of online learning mentioned above, some other people are holding views against and claim that those who applying face to face learning may gain much more benefits. Indeed, schooling can create an interactive environment. For instance, the students in classroom are able to receive direct comments or satisfactory explanation from the teachers, which may be impossible for online learners. Furthermore having friends around a student makes learning environment more competitive. If the students are put under pressure of competing against their peers, they will be able to learn faster and more effectively. In addition, schools provide modern equipment and facilities such as labs and libraries that give the learners a considerable assistance to research or conduct some experiments.
In conclusion, although there is a wide range of benefits which learning via Internet can bring to people, I strongly argue that school is still the best place to acquire knowledge.

As they grow older, adults often like to think back on their childhood days.  Are childhood and primary school days the best times in a person’s life?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
It seems that in today’s world, people are doing everything at a faster pace.  Family time, work and even recreation time happen all too quickly.  In response, people like to remember the times when things moved a little slower.  I often look back on my childhood and primary school days – when life was more ‘simple’ – and wish I could return to them.
There are some down-sides to being a child.  A child is inexperienced, and lacks understanding about life; he or she must go through a period of learning basic ‘life skills’ such as manners and appropriate language.  A child also lacks wisdom and will therefore make mistakes that an older, more mature person would not normally make.
However, there are many more positive aspects of being a child.  One of the biggest benefits is in the area of sleep.  Generally, parents encourage children to ‘go to bed early’ for one reason or another.  Sleep seems to be something that most adults wish they had more of!  Another benefit of being a child is in the area of responsibility.  The only person a child is responsible for is himself!  Life is therefore less complicated and slower-paced.  In addition, children are normally not engaged in full-time work.  This means the stress of finding and keeping a job is not a part of their life.
Childhood for most people is certainly a stress-free time!  For me, childhood was a wonderful experience that I very happily look back upon.  I believe that childhood and primary school days are among the best times in a person’s life.
[ Written by – Raghunath.S ]
Sample Answer 2:
It is obvious that by time, people start to miss the old days when they were young, believing that these were the best days of their lives. In my point of view, this is totally wrong for many reasons like long-lasting relationships, financial independence and having contented family life.
Firstly, adulthood is characterized by the maturity of the person’s thoughts and having a wealth of shared experience, this has many positive aspects such as building long-lasting friendships. While early in childhood, one does not appreciate the importance of relationships, and tend to underrate friendships, mature adults realize how meaningful it is to have a lifelong friend.
Another reason is experiencing the financial independence and having one’s own career. This is considered a source of pride and happiness to any person, especially when he is successful in his job. For instance, a school-aged boy is always completely dependent on his parents, so he must ask them to pay for every single thing he needs and so everything lies under their own opinion and permission, whereas when he grows older, he would have his own income, so he can spend any amount of money on whatever he wants.
A final reason to mention is the joy of having a contented family life of one’s own. Being a responsible partner in such a long-term successful relationship, and raising your own offspring can have a wonderful effect on your soul. This opportunity is not offered to young irresponsible children though.
In conclusion, childhood may have many joyful moments of freedom and lack of responsibility, but eventually joys of maturity supersedes these moments.

What your opinion on this issue?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Over specialisation at much younger age in many countries is debarring students from gaining elementary level of science. It is undoubtedly useful to man in many ways in today’s age of science and technology.
As it is important, hence it is taught to students till the age of 15. Due to this they attain basic knowledge of Botany, Zoology, Chemistry and Physics. Now, understanding of plants and trees helps them in gardening and teach them its necessity as they are the source of oxygen. Then Zoology helps them to know about other creatures they are surrounded by, importance of animals in maintaining food chain and thus ecosystem and also teaches them general functioning of the human body and how it is affected in common diseases like cough, cold and diarrhoea. After that, chemistry is useful to understand the composition of different materials, for instance how to make plaster of Paris, a commonly used substance in construction. Finally, physics teaches the mechanics of machines, and its repairing.  Without the knowledge of Physics, we cannot imagine the World we live in.
Besides these knowledge helps us to lead a better life everyday and prevents us from many dangers. We are taught first aid treatment for some emergencies like fire burn, accidents, heart attacks, snake bites et cetera. Moreover, the dangers due to electricity are prevented, as we are demonstrated that, water and body are good conductors of electricity and we must not touch the bare wire. In addition, I feel it helps us to develop a scientific approach towards everything, thus does not allow the superstitious thoughts to dominate our mind and also keeps us safe from being fooled by the cunning spiritual mystics.
In conclusion, scientific knowledge has changed the face of society in many ways, hence its propagation is must if we want to live in the civilised and advance world we have created.

The threat of nuclear weapons maintains world peace. Nuclear power provides cheap and clean energy. The benefit of nuclear technology far outweighs the disadvantages.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Nuclear weapon is the double-edged sword as it has devastating power, while it helps maintain world peace. Besides, nuclear technology helps generate cheap and clean energy. To my way of thinking, nuclear technology is boon to human civilization despite its possibility of lethal consequence.
For a start, it sounds paradoxical that the threat of nuclear weapons may maintain world peace. Historically, the ending of the Second World War was accelerated by the dropping of nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and helped maintain long peace between superpowers during the cold war. Why did this happen? The simple math is that when both sides come to realize they can turn one another to ashes with the pressing of a button, they then eventually retreat from their decision. The atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki have changed all by making the costs of nuclear war obvious, unacceptable, and inevitable. Besides, war-prone states is forced to realize that war with a nuclear state is invincible, and thus not worth the effort. Nuclear weapon, in fact, dissuades war-prone states from starting warfare.
Apart from that, nuclear technology is silver bullet to the catastrophic consequences of environmental problems. That is to say, the excessive use of fossil fuels worsens the climate of our planet by increasing global temperature, and unlike fossil fuels, which emit detrimental gases, we can produce green energy with the help of nuclear technology. In addition to this, many deadly diseases can be diagnose at the primary stage and treated effectively with the nuclear technology. For instance, cancer can now be diagnosed at the earlier stage with the help of the nuclear technology called MRI scanner, and treated effectively with radiation therapy.
In fine, nuclear technology has immense benefits to human civilization, while it has prospect of bringing apocalyptic destruction. It can maintain world peace, protect environment, and cure fatal diseases. So, the benefits of the nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages.

Should uniform be there or should the students be allowed to wear whatever they like? 
What is your opinion on that?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Victoria Beckham, the famous fashion designer, singer and model, said, “I have always loved fashion since I was a kid and customized my school uniforms”.  However, recently school uniforms spark a heated debate that whether students should have complete control over the cloth they wear at school or school should decide what dress the students wear. In my opinion, there should be a dress code.
To commence with, uniform brings forth a sense of belonging and oneness. Everyone is on the same team.  As on football teams, jerseys are worn for instant identification and to ignite a feeling of oneness. When a supporter puts on his favourite team’s jersey, a gesture of solidarity is automatically emerged. Likewise, when the students wear uniforms that demonstrate an immediate identification and cause a feeling of oneness and belonging.
In addition, uniforms reduce the peer pressure when it comes to their outfit. When they are worn the same dress, worrying about what they look like is not so significant. It discourages the competition about the latest trend of fashion, which often put a great extent of financial pressure on parents. Apart from that, uniform can reduce the incident of bullying. Peers find it difficult to make fun of what one is wearing, when he is put on exactly the same dress.
Summing all of the above, uniforms help evoke the sense of oneness, equality, and belonging.  That is why, I think there should be uniforms and the students ought not to be allowed to dress whatever they wish.

Environmental problems are too difficult to solve by individual countries and individual people. There should be an international approach towards them.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Environmental issues have become the most pressing problem around the world. The problems, which have global impacts, are very complex that no individual country or people can curb these issues alone. Indeed, there should be an international policy to grapple with the environmental problems.
To start with, pollution often is the consequence of activities at global level. Besides, the lethal consequences of pollution do not confine to the boundary of any one country. This is because, the pernicious effects of pollution very often affect the population beyond the country where the contamination originated. A case in point is the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, which has become a global environmental issue. The depletion is increase the exposure to solar UV radiation which in turn will contribute to the incident of cataracts and cancer. The exhaustion of the stratospheric ozone layer, in fact, will severely harm each and every living being on earth. So, international cooperation is needed to quell this issue.
Likewise, greenhouse gas emission has also a grave global impact. Whether the harmful gases are emitted in Europe, Africa, America, or Asia, they disperse rapidly throughout the planet. As a result, our globe is warming, from North Pole to South Pole and everywhere in between. The signs of global warming are appearing all over. Not only is the heat melting glaciers and sea ice, but also it is shifting precipitation patterns, which by consequence could cause many animals, bird, and plants to become extinct.
From what has been discussed above, it is clear that environmental problems affect everybody and everywhere no matter where the pollution is originated. Therefore, if we battle against environmental issue effectively, there must have an international approach.

Some people say that tourism should be encouraged because of its benefits, while others say that increased tourism activities actually harm the environment and local culture of an area. 
Discuss both views and give your opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
The fast growing hospitality and tourism industry is one of the largest revenue earners. Many economists opine that tourism ought to be encouraged as it has myriad advantages, but others, on the other hand, argue that excessive tourism activities are lethal to environment. While each side has its merits, I think the benefits of tourism outweigh the disadvantages.
For a start, tourism offers enormous benefits to a country. The key benefits are mainly economic, socio-cultural and environmental. First of all, the tourism industry includes many different sectors, so it also generates job opportunities in many different sectors. With the industry comes hotels, restaurants, tour agencies, car rental agencies, souvenir shops, and much more. All of this spawns plenty of employment for people in the local community. Secondly, tourism can fuel a real sense of pride and identity. By showcasing the unique features of the way of life, history and heritage, tourism can spur people on to preserve tradition which may be at stake. Last but not the least, tourism usually fosters preservation and conservation of cultural, natural, and historical resources. It also encourages community beautification and to keep environment clean.
On the flip side, tourism can badly damage environment. It may menace specific natural resources, for example coral reefs, beaches, historical sights, and so on. In addition to this, tourism can increase noise, pollution, and litter. To cap it all, it directly contributes to solid waste pollution and sewage. Apart from that, the negative effects of tourism development can gradually devastate the environmental resources on which it depends. That is to say, it depletes limited resources, for example fresh water, land, wild life habitats, and so forth.
In fine, tourism causes multifaceted benefits to the local community, but the advantage comes at a price. Since, tourism involves the activities that can have adverse environmental impacts.

Some people believe that the best time for a person to learn a new language is when he/she is a child.  Others feel adults learn languages better and faster than children.
Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Herbert Geoffrey Willans, an English author and journalist, said, “you can never understand one language until you understand at least two”. People are split in their opinion when it comes to the issue whether a child or an adult is better to the acquisition of a new language. Some people think that childhood is the best time to acquire a second language, while others opine that adults can learn a foreign language better and faster than children. As far as it concerns me that adults are better than children in acquisition of a new language.
To commence with, one thing is needed to be clear that there is a difference between learning and acquisition. That is to say, second language learning is not the same as second language acquisition. Learning is a conscious process in which people study to acquire a new language, while the second language acquisition happens in subconscious process. In the case of children, they obtain a new language through the subconscious system. A child can acquire a new language if exposed to it on a regular basis in a social setting. So, children may naturally obtain native fluency in a new language under these circumstances.
On the other hand, many linguists tend to believe that adults are better than children as they have pre-existing language knowledge. Adults already know how to structure a sentence, and they have a good sense of pronunciation, punctuation, and spelling, while children are still developing these skills. Adults, in fact, possess an internalized grammar of the native language which is conducive to learning a new language. In my opinion, however, I believe that children are better when it comes to a new language acquisition. According to many neuroscientists, children utilize a part of their brain called “deep motor area” in order to process language information. The process is an automatic function of children’s brain which is used to obtain language, so it is a natural process for the children.
All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume that the children are better at acquisition of a new language than adults. Since, children can acquire a new language naturally. Therefore, early age is the best time for an individual to obtain a second language.

People attend college or university for many different reasons (Experience, career preparation, Increased Knowledge).
Why do you think people attend college or university? Use specific reason and examples to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer: 
College or university is an important step for youngsters. It offers myriad opportunities in their upcoming life. It opens up a new horizon to them. It is something more than the job or career. People enroll in college or university primarily for being enlightened. Then people expect a higher earning potential with a college or university degree.
For a start, the tertiary education is much more than just attaining a degree. The university provides people with the new insight into the world around them. It teaches students how to extract knowledge and how to produce new knowledge. That is to say, tertiary education enables individuals to expand the horizon of new knowledge and wisdom, develop skill and competence to more successful in life, grasp abstract theories and concepts, and above all to enhance the comprehension of the world and the society.
Besides, individuals also like to attend university or college for the opportunity to read books and texts, and listen to the speeches of leading experts in their respective fields. This stimulation inspires individuals to ask questions, explore new ideas, and think about phenomena that excel themselves with an edge in the job fields over those who do not attend college or university. Take my elder brother for an example. He earns the university degree and joins a multinational company. Just with the knowledge and skills he attains from the university, he is able to way up the corporate ladder. So, people want to enroll at college or university to hone their skills and acumen so that they get an edge over those who have not earned a university degree.
From what has been discussed above, it is to be concluded that individuals attend college or university in order for gaining knowledge and wisdom that offer them a competitive edge over their counterparts.

Some of the methods used in advertising are unethical and unacceptable in today’s society.
To what extend do you agree with this point of view?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Essay :
In this cut-throat competitive business world, we are submerged with umpteen numbers of commercials every day. Many of the methods used in these ads are to be considered as immoral and untenable. In the case, subliminal advertising technique is the most used handy tool to practice unethical advertising.
For a start, there are many products like cigarettes, diet pill or beauty cream that we do not need at all. But what I mean by unethical advertising is subliminal advertising. Subliminal advertising conveys the message designed to pass beyond the normal limits of perception. That is to say that it might not be discerned by the conscious mind, but subconscious mind could perceive the message. It is perceived unconsciously and yet unperceived consciously. In 1957, Vance Packard sheds light on this phenomenon in a book entitled The Hidden Persuaders. In the book, the author discusses how the movie theatres uses subliminal message to increase the sales lead of Coca-Cola and popcorn at their stands.
An ethical advertising is used to distinguish a product from its competitors so that the product can be ahead of competition, whereas unethical commercial tries to blur the distinction and intentionally confuses the consumers. In this instance, subliminal commercial imprints a fake image of a product on the viewers’ unconscious mind that makes a desire they will unknowingly connect to the product consumption. Morally good advertising seeks to move consumers to act rationally and select the products that fit their needs. But subliminal advertising refrains from acting rationally.
Based on above discussion, it could be easily said that subliminal advertising is unethical and unacceptable as well.

A newspaper article was published recently about a 14 year old boy who had dangerously damaged his school. For that he was given a punishment to clean the streets. Should young criminals be punished by sending them to jail or any other alternative form of punishment should be given.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Passing judgment on the juvenile criminals is the most difficult task for the guardians of law. Is it justifiable, to send them to jail, like adults? I believe, no reasons can defend this punishment, rather alternative forms of treatment should be adopted.
Child’s mind is extremely pliant. It accepts everything going around it as a right way, whether it is a violent television programme or a rude behaviour of their parents, teachers and elders. Moreover, they are often brainwashed by the adults to follow a wrong path, for instance, below 18 terrorists’ minds are filled with hatred against the particular group of a society by their religious leaders. And many times they commit crime because of their impulsive behaviour. Hence, their consciousness cannot be held responsible for such actions.
Prison is not a right place for the juveniles. Firstly, its loneliness and other criminal presence can provoke them to adopt an antisocial behaviour. Secondly, they may lose faith on the judicial system, and might end up again in the jail by repeatedly committing a same offense. Finally, their immature body is not meant for the harsh physical activities in the jail.
Instead, sending them to rehabilitation centre is the best alternative, if child has committed a serious offense like murder, there he shall be taught moral values and other socially acceptable behaviour and, for the smaller crime such as theft, parents should be asked to teach that. In a situation given in the question, I feel that giving him a humiliating punishment would damage his self respect and overall mental development, rather than bringing a positive change.
In conclusion, punishing the innocent mind for the surroundings we have created is not at all reasonable.

Write about the following topic:
The state of the environment is now a cause for concern in all countries across the world. Apart from government measures and policies, what can individuals do on a personal level to combat the negative effects that our lifestyles have on the environment?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
Environmental pollution has become the most pressing issue in all countries around the globe. Each government has adopted several policy in order to deal with this problem. But, we as an individual can curb the negative effects stemmed from environment pollution by simply changing our lifestyles that contribute to the phenomena.
To commence with, our lifestyle causes pollution. For example, electricity has become the bedrock of our society and we cannot think of a moment without it. But the electricity is generated through polluting sources for instance the burning of fossil fuels like oil and natural gas. We can reduce pollution by conserving energy. For instance, we can do it by turning off bulbs, computers, and other electric appliances when they are not in use. Apart from that, we can use green energy which does not deplete natural resources and does not contribute to the environmental harm. Take solar energy as an example. Solar energy is the energy generated from the light and heat of the sun.
In addition, vehicle exhaust is a major contributor to air pollution which harms environment severely. Individuals can help prevent air pollution through changing driving habit. Vehicle emissions can be sharply reduced by less driving. Take me for example. I make single trip to stock up on everything I need instead of driving to the grocery stores several times. In addition to this, everyone can ameliorate the environment by using public transportation. For example, more people can travel in a single bus or train, and if one chooses private car rather than bus or train, for instance, he will cause several time more CO2 emission that will lead to the environmental damage.
To wrap up, the rise of concern about the environment ripples through the nations. Everyone should take part in the endeavour combatting against the adverse effects of environmental damage in tandem with the government.

Parents are the best teachers.
Do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Parents are the individuals who touch our lives in a unique way. They are the best teachers as parents exert a strong influence on their offspring’s eventual life outcomes. They teach us how to speak, walk, and behave. Parents, in fact, involve in the early stage of leaning in the period most children learn more than their rest of life.
There are many factors lie in the learning process of children. Most important factors are usually determined by a child’s innate temperament. In the case, parents are the persons who know and understand their children better than anyone and can nurture their curiosity to learn in the best way by perceiving their children’s interest. They can create a positive environment conducive to learning as a child’s education involves in everything he experiences or his senses encounter. Most importantly, they instill moral responsibility towards society. That is to say, as parents, individuals filter and interpret the world for their children, entertain children’s curiosity, instill values, and enrich children’s mind as a whole.
Are parents, however, best teachers? It depends on what teaching means. If teaching is confined to in primarily reading, writing, science, history, and geography, then formal teachers in schools or colleges would perhaps be deemed to be the best teachers. But when it comes to point of overall education, parents are incomparable. In other words, the formal educators can never replace parents in the constituting of children’s character, life, and future.
All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume that parents are the best teachers we have. Although parents are not professional teachers, they can bring up children as well-rounded.

Some believe that old employees are more beneficial to a company. Whereas, others believe that young employees are more useful.
Discuss both the views and give your opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Though both the young and older employees serve sincerely for the companies they are engaged in, argument goes on which one of them is the best. Some of the people prefer the old ones while the rest rely on the younger employees. A discussion on their pros and cons may help deciding the right one before recruitment at any organization.
So far, there are no reasonable solutions found against this argument that which one is most suitable for work. But the importance of experts and apprentices cannot be ignored either. Generally, few HR departments believe that old employees are enriched with skills and expertise, and perform better than the youngsters. Yes, this is right. Experts naturally perform better while such performances are unexpected from the young employees.
But on the other side, many of the hiring authorities argue that the young employees are filled with inspiration and want to prove their worth always. As a result, they believe, the output result is increased. So, the drawbacks like wisdom, judgment etc., of the young, are often overlooked.
Since they have few limitations, the young employees get into troubles but they simultaneously learn to eliminate the difficulties with their ready wits, intelligence and smartness. Some argue that the new employees are tech savvy than the old employees and thus require less training to get accustomed with technological use in the organization.
Again, to back the young employees, some say that young employees could be modified after requirement which is a bit difficult for the seniors. Further, arguments favoring the elderly say that they (the experts) work more sincerely and prefer staying at office for longer hours while the younger are indifferent to this specific issue.
Finally, considering the views, it appears that both the experts and fresh bloods are required for the development of an organization. The skilled are enriched with expertise and they could spread their knowledge among the learners. So, the organizations should make a balance while staffing. Setting up a balanced ratio for hiring experts and beginners may result a desired productive environment.

Nowadays, parents send their children abroad for further education. At what age should they send their children abroad? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Education is an unending process and requires no specific age limit. But when it is about getting admitted into a foreign institute, a child should be of specific age and I believe it should be at least 18 years. However, there are some advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad as well.
I believe 18 is the perfect age for entering into adulthood and people become able to take care of you. They can take decisions by them at this age, while their mental faculty also gets an expansion and learn critical thinking. In a foreign country they will be unable to adjust and the situations may go wrong. So, it is wise to send children for foreign education when they turn 18.
Usually students in foreign institutes learn differently and when they will travel abroad, the trip makes them familiar with newer things and by the same time is entertaining as well. The overseas trip also helps to expand their imagination. Secondly, language has great influence on people’s lives and when the kids will be into a new place, they need to learn the local language that also enriches their language skills. In fact, learning a second language helps people in many aspects and particularly bears positive impacts on career selection. Moreover, studying abroad helps learning new cultures, customs, manners and those could be applied in the practical life.
Now, come back to the disadvantages. The most important drawback is excessive cost. Due to currency fluctuation, the expenses are never steady. Consequently the tuition fees and living costs are higher than living in the native country. Often the students have to drop out as they cannot bear all the costs. Besides, adjustment with the surrounding is a great issue to consider. To take a real life example, one of my cousins, Samantha, went to USA last year for her study but returned home within a few weeks. She could not cope up with surrounding situations. Age was an important factor – she was 16 then.
Thereby, it is imperative to send children in foreign institutes when they are adult enough (at least 18) to take their own care and simultaneously the parents must own the ability to stand against the excessive costs.

Some people think that recent innovations in technology have made life more comfortable and helped us to be more efficient by saving us time, while others argue that technology has made us less efficient. 
Discuss both these views and give your opinion. 
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Technology ripples through the modern life. People are divided in their opinion when it comes to the point of efficiency brought by technology. Some people contend that the latest invention in technology has revolutionized human lives making it more comfortable and boost our efficiency by saving time, but others, on the other hand, refute the argument. To my way of thinking, the cutting-edge technologies have made our life phenomenally comfortable.
For a start, technology is a godsend to us as it makes our lives easier than ever before. It enables people to do things in the blink of an eye. A case in point is the Internet, which makes information available that we can access anytime, anywhere. The immediate access to the incredibly rich storage of information translates myriad difficult tasks into easy matter. For example, the researchers, in the past, had to work hard to find handy information spending hours after hours in the library, while today they can do it easily and instantly surfing the Internet. That is to say that the Internet is a magical tool as it saves times and labour enormously. The recent technology, thus, has elevated our lifestyle saving time and effort.
But the boon does not come without a price. People are becoming more and more dependent on technology. Technology indulges the young generation to lead sedentary life that causes many health problems. Consequently, human being’s physical and mental efficiency is being deteriorating day by day. In addition, nowadays most interactions take place through social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, etc. As a result, individuals’ interpersonal skill is gradually becoming blunt. So, people often cannot efficiently interact with one another like bygone days.
In fine, the neoteric technological wizardry has made modern life unprecedentedly comfortable. At the same time, it also shrinks human ability. But, in my opinion, its fabulous benefits outweigh the disadvantages it causes.

Some people think the most efficient way to reduce the industrial pollution is to tax the companies which cause the pollution. Others think that there are better ways to reduce the pollution. 
Discuss both sides of the argument and give your views.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
Pollution is one of the most pressing global issues nowadays and government of different countries are trying to battle this heinous issue from different perspectives and imposing tax to companies who are responsible for creating pollution is one of the ways. Definitely imposing high tax to industries that are responsible for polluting environment is a good way to tackle the pollution but in my opinion this is not the best way to reduce pollution.
It is true that industries that are in manufacturing sector are polluting the air, water and sound significantly. The amounts of CO2 emission by such industries are higher than many other sectors. So to control the amount of pollution they are creating, government can impose a really high tax rate. This would in one hand discourage the expansion and growth of such industries due to the high tax rate and on the other hand would increase the fund the government has for fighting the environmental pollution. Almost every government has projects like plantation, green environment and the high tax would ensure bigger amounts in these funds.
Again, high tax rate in industry level would not be the best way to reduce the environment pollution. Awareness among people, taking more initiatives like creating a green environment, controlling the amount of private cars run in the streets, controlling unfit vehicles, reducing the unnecessary factories and researching to find out the type of fuels that create less pollution would be other better solutions. Some large industries that are polluting the environment would not reduce the amount of pollution they create even if they are imposed with high tax. Their earnings are in millions of dollars per day. Few thousands for tax are insignificant for them. So in my opinion this is definitely not the best solution to fight pollution.
In conclusion, high tax imposing to industries is a good way to increase the government funds for battling the pollution but this is not the best way to control the environmental pollution. Individual person’s awareness, participation and government’s policy to reduce the private car ownership, plantation and research for innovation methods would be better solution.

Popular Hobbies and interests change over time and are more a reflection of trends and fashions than an indication of what individuals really want to do in their spare time.
To what extent do you agree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Hobby refers to what individuals love to do on their spare time. However, popular hobbies change as the time goes by. That is why, people think that popular hobbies are more a reflection of the vogue of the time rather than the individuals’ predilections. To my way of thinking, there is a reciprocal relation between time and individuals’ predilection. So, popular hobbies are the reflection of trend and fashion as well as individuals’ preferences.
To commence with, no man can remain aloof from the era he lives in. Consequently, an epoch has a strong influence on the people. That is to say, a particular time moulds people’s psychic pattern based on the particular aspects of the time, which in turn change everything around him and hobbies are no exception. Which is why, popular hobbies change with the course of time. For instance, once women had interest in knitting or sewing and they loved to do it on their free time. But women nowadays spend their spare time playing sports.  This is because,   sports has become popular more than ever before.
However, hobbies are the acts what essentially are something done with obvious pleasure. Hobbies cannot solely depend on the trend and fashion of a time. Although the current trend influences popular hobbies to a great extent, individuals’ likes and dislikes play a vital role in hobby. To put it another way, we all have our own predilection when it comes to hobby. Take our case for example. People of the twenty first century spend their free time making new friends through social sites. The Internet indeed influences the act, but at the same time we really love to do it. So, although current vogue influences popular hobbies, personal preferences remain constant beyond the trend of the time.
All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume that the trend and popular hobbies are interrelated in such a way that one can be influenced by the other.

Some people say that money is not necessary for happiness of the people in a country. Others say rich economy helps in bringing happiness to the people.
Discuss both sides and give your opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
According to Jane Austen, “money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it”. There is much lively debate about the correlation between money and happiness. In many circles, it is believed that having robust economy does not necessarily mean that people will be happy of the country, while others contend that sound economy brings forth happiness to the citizens. In the instance, I am of the honest opinion, economic prosperity does not make people happy if there is an absence of fair distribution of wealth.
A strong economy may lead to happiness. With the strong economy, a country may able to increase wages that contribute to per capita income. That is to say, the sound economy enhances people’s purchasing capacity. Which by consequence enables people meeting their basic needs and amenities. And people tend to be happy when people meet their basic demands. Apart from that, the government also able to develop infrastructure, such as school, hospitals, roads and highways, amusement park and so on, which in turn help improve the living standard of the country, and people are likely happy in consequence of better living standard.
But, economic progress does not always translate to happiness. Economic growth, in reality, is typically not shared equally among the segments of society, which in turn leads to income inequality. Therefore, although a nation’s GDP may be rapidly rising, only relatively few people are getting the benefits from the economic progress. Common people are actually not befitting from the economic prosperity. For example, many studies shows that in the years of economic growth but income disparities between poor and rich are growing, there was no rise in a nation’s happiness.  So, life satisfaction or happiness does not increase in tandem with economic prosperity.
At this juncture, I completely agree with the notion that a strong economy does not necessarily make people happy. For a country’s happiness to increase, accumulation of wealth is not sufficient. The fair distribution of wealth critically determines whether the population’s life satisfaction will increase on the whole. On the basis of the discussion, it is safe to say that if economic prosperity and happiness go hand in hand, it is when the wealth is distributed evenly.

Even though Globalization affects the world’s economics in a very positive way, its negative sides should not be forgotten. Discuss.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:

Globalization is the phenomenon as we perceive it could be defined best as the growing mobility of capital through the transfer of goods and services as well as the greater stream of information across national frontiers owing to unprecedented development in technology and the market economy. The phenomenon has brought forth a global shift, that is, a world being transformed into a shared political and economic arena. Although world’s economy seems to thrive on it, its negative impacts is enormous that must be considered.
For a start, as the barriers to trade and commerce has been removed, global markets have emerged for myriad goods and, increasingly, services. Apart from that, globalization causes a cut-throat competition, which in turn helps consumers get the commodities and services in a relatively cheap price. In addition, the spread of information and ideas promotes awareness of human rights norms and democracy. As a result, the overall living standard has improved with the rise of globalization. Most importantly, human experience is enriched by the sharing of customs, cultures, foods, and so forth.
However, globalization is an ideological construct employed to trumpet capitalist victory ¬¬– to hide the crisis-ridden nature of the system, and its inherent failure to meet the needs of marginal population. Capitalists seek to gain competitive advantage over one another by the natural procedure of capitalist accumulation that of maximizing profit and minimizing cost. Developed nations tend to profit from globalization in several ways when negotiating with developing countries. Multinational enterprises that go developing countries for instance, gain from cheaper land and tax rate, cheaper labour force, cheaper raw materials, and so forth. In the end however, many a multinational enterprises end up negatively affecting the host nation’s economy by taking all profit back home, politically by paying bribes to the government officials for reducing tax rates or other tariffs, and finally also socially, by polluting environment.
Summing all of the above, many negative impacts could be stemmed from globalizations. It has enabled trade and commerce to grow, capital and information flows to increase, but has failed to establish a better allocation of resources to be met across the globe. We, therefore, have to mull over the opportunities globalization offers before making any policy in favour of it.

In many countries, children are given a lot of homework. Some people feel that if children are given less homework, then they will face less stress and can also develop extra skills.
What is your opinion about this?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Amount of homework and the pressure the school kids face nowadays are two great concerns for many, especially for the parents. Many people say that increased numbers of homework are effective as this keeps the children focused on education and schools while other oppose this and argue that this trend creates an immense pressure in children’s  psychology and hinder any creativity they might have. In my opinion, a balanced condition could be effective where homework itself should be creative.
Student life is the time to learn and enhance knowledge and as part of school education teachers give homework to the students. This homework is proven to be part of effective learning as almost all of the schools use it. The students are given homework to make sure they are studying and practicing at home. The parents carefully monitor the progress of their children and mostly homework and teachers’ grading are two tools for them for the monitoring. Homework often tests the students understanding level of a lesson taught by the teacher. Many teachers even use the performance of the homework as a criterion to grade a student at the end of the term. From this perspective homework is a good tool to enhance the performance of the students.
However, it is not uncommon that the amounts of homework given to the students become burden for many students. They can hardly manage time to concentrate on other important things. This is sometimes so time consuming that parents have to get involved to finish the homework of a student. This definitely has a bad impact on students. Firstly, the pressure of homework would create a negative psychological effect on children and they would start disliking the whole concept of school and education. Teaching should be fun and the homework should not be a way to finish the prescribed syllabus. Teachers should try to finish the lessons and tests on the classroom and give some homework that requires creativity and few hours to finish. This would encourage the students to have more interest on schools, homework and education. Homework like free writing, drawing, small scientific projects, internet browsing for information could be good way to let the students explore more and learn more. Thus the students would feel an enthusiasm about their study and would get opportunity to flourish their hidden creativity.
In conclusion, homework is a proven method to keep students engaged in education but too much academic tasks at home should be changed in a way where homework would be fun, entertaining, thought-provoking and educational. This would ensure a better balance among the creativity and education for children.

Person above 55 years should get retired from their post and younger generation should be given a chance?
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give your opinion and example to support your essay.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
The retirement age limit has been phased out. Today an employee can work for as long as he wants to. Many people argue that default retirement age should be 55 so that the younger generation can get opportunity. In the instance, I incline to the opinion that there should be an age limit for the employees.
With the ever changing business environment, older generation has become outmoded. They are no longer able to cope with the workplace environment based on sophisticated technology. In default of technology skills, the generation of older workers cannot   perform as efficiently as its counterparts. The older workers, in fact, rein the pace that a company finds it difficult to reach its goal. Eventually, the company would struggle to survive into cut-throat competitive business world.
In contrast, younger generation is crammed with energy, enthusiasm, adaptability, technological knowledge, and so on. Youngsters can work hard than that of their counterpart. They go about their tasks with great enthusiasm. Most importantly, they are usually adaptable to the realm of technology and the changing workplace environment. Besides, young employees are more innovative than the older generation. For success, companies need innovative ideas and enthusiasm which are offered by youth. With the young leadership, therefore, a corporation may appear to be ahead of its competitors.
To reiterate, the default retirement age should be phased in over the few years. I think that if an employee stays in the job for more than 55 years, he gets stale. On the other hand, I believe that younger leadership can run corporations better than their counterpart, as they have sound knowledge of technology and the needs of today’s generation. So, we should fix default retirement age at 55 years.

Some parts of the world are facing problems of fresh water shortage and this has brought awareness about the seriousness of the problem among all the countries.
What should the government and individual do to solve the problem?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Fresh water shortage is a concerning issue now, and the countries experiencing the scarcity has become serious to get rid of the problem. Around 70 percent of the earth is covered with water while the sum of freshwater is too little. Thereby, the shortage is acute in some places and the government and individuals should take steps to solve the problem.
Mostly due to geographical advantage, some of the regions are enriched with fresh waters while many of the parts are devoid of it. But the little freshwater we have is getting reduced for several reasons and primarily for the unwise activities by the human beings. Currently the freshwater is being used to serve almost all the purposes including cooking, drinking, bathing, cleaning and people seem to be competing in spending the freshwater.
As a result, freshwater shortage in many of the regions is becoming acute and worsening the situations as well. But if the existing trend continues, the scarcity will hit the remaining parts soon and also will make survival for humans and other living beings tougher.
So, all the governments should be more serious about the issue and adopt immediate measures preventing freshwater shortage. It should be taken as a challenge by the governments to overcome. Besides, the countries could also instruct citizens not to use chemicals and pesticides excessively in farming food and other crops near the freshwater sources, and strict measures should be adopted against the violators.
In individual level, mass awareness is required. The awareness will help freshwater waste prevention. Individuals could also come forward to prevent the ongoing freshwater pollution. They also should be sensitized over the preservation of the freshwater.

In many countries traditional foods is replaced by international fast foods. This has adverse effects on families, individuals, and the society.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer :
International fast foods have outdated the traditional foods from the menu in many of the countries and started bearing detrimental health impacts on the consumers from several aspects. Unfortunately, people ignore the issue. Though fast foods own few short-term benefits, the effects on human body are undesirable indeed and people should pay more attention to change the food habits.
Usually citizens change their food habits for some advantages while the fast foods offer some lucrative features. Firstly, they are handy and sold at a cheaper rate. One can take the foods from anywhere. Besides, some of the fast foods really taste delicious. But the most important feature is that one can have it at any time of the day. So, being too much busy with the mechanized life, people hardly can manage time for cooking foods at home, and thus many of the traditional foods have been altered with international fast foods in many countries.
Fast foods could be taken once or twice in a month but accepting those as regular meals will result in some hazardous health consequences. The most unwanted factor of fast foods is that they help developing serious fitness disorders. The ingredients used to prepare the foods help to gain additional pounds which also may lead to obesity.
Moreover, fast foods develop heart ailments like coronary heart diseases, high blood pressures, high cholesterol and even cancer! The diseases develop on human body as fast foods lack the necessary nutritional elements to build a stronger physique. So, when frequently taken, people start suffering from malnutrition and turn the victim of life tolling diseases.
To conclude, although fast foods may save your time and initially meet your hunger, keep distance with the foods as they may cost your life as well. The traditional foods should be restored on the regular menu for a healthy and happy life.

Some people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the keys to reducing traffic accidents. Others, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
Hundreds of people are killed and maimed in road accidents every week. Some people call for the stringent law for driving offences. They argue that strict punishments would be the silver bullet to this problem, while others contend that other measures would be far more effective in ameliorating road safety. To my way of thinking, alternatives should be employed in tandem with strict punishment for better result.
Many accidents take place due to lax laws.  People often violate the rules as they easily rid themselves of being punished. Which is why, many people blame the laxity of law for indulging the road rage. Road rage very often leads to squabbles, indecent assaults, and collisions that cause injuries and even deaths. Thereby, many people suggest that traffic violation should be dealt seriously. For instance, the drivers who break the rules and regulation should be confined to prison temporary and their license should be suspended as well. The proponents of strict laws believe that the stringent punishment will instill responsibility or fear into the drivers, which in turn would curb the road accidents effectively.
In contrast, others think that alternative steps would be more effective in reducing road accidents. For example, they suggest that the government should increase the minimum legal age for getting driving license. In addition to this, safe driving course should be mandatory for all before getting license to drive. However, in my opinion, it is expedient to combine stern punishment with alternative so as to decrease the traffic accidents effectively and efficiently. I would like to suggest that the government should establish centres for safe drive where the government can conduct many activities, such as work shop on enhancement of skills and awareness of professional drivers and pedestrians.
Summing all of the above, it seems reasonable to assume that the traffic accidents can be reduced dramatically if the stiff punishments coupled with alternative measures are implemented.
Sample Answer 2:
Several views have opined in favor of strict punishment for driving offences while the others are after adopting road safety measures in order to reduce the road accidents. Both of the views try upholding their own thoughts with strong arguments. But the application of the both appears to be more suitable.
Often there are road accidents that take away valuable lives. This is definitely a crime and sometimes it goes unnoticed. Thereby, strict measures are required to prevent the crime and the drivers will learn lessons from the punishments, argue some people. They also believe that it is only punishment which makes the drivers bound to follow the rules and regulations to avoid traffic accidents. When any of the drivers are punished, it will be an exemplary event to the other drivers, they also believe. So, they are in favor of strict actions against the drivers.
On the other side, another school is on the argument that measures like awareness creation among the drivers and commoners over the traffic accidents and road safety is the right way to prevent the accidents. They consider that most of the accidents occur for the lack of driving awareness or pedestrian movements on the streets. Often the drivers lose control as people move on the streets carelessly. So, when all the people will be aware of road safety issues, the number of accidents will get reduced, they argue.
Both the ideas are fine but there are some troubles over implementing the ideas in everywhere. Usually awareness is required in places where people are ignorant of traffic rules and regulations. But in most of the states, the drivers are educated and careful. So, they in fact do not require the awareness. The idea could be applied on the countries where majority of the citizens are illiterate. Further, the punishment issue is also inapplicable in some states and the authorities disallow strict punishment even in the cases of serious offences (like murder). So, they will not permit stringent actions against the drivers for road safety.
But, in conclusion, it could be done that there should be a combination of punishment and other road safety measures. The drivers and pedestrians should be made aware and in case of accidents, both should be punished. When a traffic accident occurs, the negligence of both the driver and the victim is equally liable. Thereby, both of them should be made aware about the road safety issues and related punishment. The strict measure alone is unable to improve the road safety issues unless the other measures join their hands.

We have developed into a “throw-away” society and are filling the environment with rubbish that we cannot fully dispose of.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
What measures should be taken to combat this problem?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:

Consumerism has transformed our society into the “throw-away” society. The society evokes the critical notion of excessive consumption and proliferation of disposable or short-lived commodities. However, it goes without saying that our society has transformed into a “throw-away” society with the amount of goods we claim as useless or broken. We have to change our consumerist attitude in order to grapple with this phenomenon.
For a start, capitalism is leading to a “throw-away” society. Capitalists want to gain competitive edge over each other by the inherent process of capitalist accumulation that of maximizing profit and minimizing cost. Multinational corporations are establishing their factories in the countries with cheap labour cost. In turn, broken items are mended in the developing countries where labour cost is relatively high. The consumer replaces a broken product in consequence of extremely high labour cost and discards the useless item. In addition, supercapitalism, coined by Robert Reigh, also contributes to the phenomenon. According to the concept, waste are produced by making products feel outmoded as soon as they are brought. With each sell of a new gadget or even automobile, the product will quickly feel obsolete, driving to the cycle of waste and high renewal needs. The society, thus, is turned into a “throw-away” society.
In order to curb this issue, we have combat against our throw-away mentality. We live under the capitalist economy that always endeavours to produce, promote, and espouse the values of materialistic attitude. We are enticed to strive for more, but this onward attitude contributes to the throw-away mentality that leads to “throw-away” society. That is why, it is important to fight against the onward attitude of wanting more, and appreciate and value what we have.
From what has been discussed above, it could be easily concluded that our society has turned into the “throw-away” society. The root cause of this phenomenon is our unquenchable thrust for new products, whether they are necessary for us or not. So, we have to change our mentality so as to deal with the issue.

In most universities students focus on specialised subjects however some people believe that universities should encourage students to study a wide spectrum of subjects.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Write at least 250 words.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Sample Answer:
University education focuses on specialised subjects while some of the schools argue on having a wide range of subjects in line with their major course which would be beneficial for them in their real life. Unfortunately the universities do not have such practices to earn diversified knowledge at the same time while studying any major course. However, such practices should be encouraged.
Usually, having a university certificate makes life easier and is a must to receive a better job and service benefits. The idea is okay. But in this is competitive age many of the students cannot stand in the row as they have knowledge on specific issues which is inapplicable in everywhere, while if they are asked to alter their career strategy, they cannot plan perfectly. But if they had the knowledge over the other contemporary subjects together with their major course, it would have been easier for them to choose a better career.
Besides, having a university degree improves the prospects of life and if the knowledge is enriched with the association of some other special subject matters, it helps them to be well-mannered human beings. The mental faculty is highly developed and analyzing ability increases by the same time.
A real life example may make the issue clearer. A student of computer science is required to study over computer programming or designing or the any other related issues. But in his/ her real life, some other understandings like knowledge of business communication, literature, history, philosophy etc. are also required. Being a specific genre student, they turn unable to pursue the knowledge and in practical situations, they turn into failures.
To sum up the issue, when students get a university declaration as a graduate, life creates chances for them. But being injected with any specific knowledge, they fail to walk a long way if there are any altercations with the real life scenarios. Only a diversified knowledge level enables them to stay strong during the entire survival journey of this competitive world.

People spend a lot of money on beauty, clothes and haircut. Some people agree that these expenses are acceptable while some others disagree?
Give your opinion on this issue.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
For modern people, it takes a lot more than a clean dress and a comb of the hair to make them feel prepared for the day. They spend a substantial sums of money on beauty, outfit, and hairstyle to ensure they look their best. Some people find these expenses quite acceptable, but the others, on the other hand, refute the notion. As far as I am concerned, I consider that these expenses are essential, as first impression matters severely in the modern society.
People’s appearance dictates how they are treated. This is because impressions are stemmed from the appearance. To put it another way, how people are perceived by others is based on how they present themselves. For example, a person in a made-to-measure outfit, clean finger nails, and good hairstyle is likely taken more seriously by the prospective employers comparing to a person in an off-the-peg dress, dirty nails, and unkempt hair. The key fact is that it is a part of non-verbal communication. Being look good expresses that the person has his act together, while looking disheveled tags all kinds of negative, although not necessarily true, traits to the person. That is why, people spends a substantial amounts of money in order to look good so that they can impress others.
In addition, the cliché “look good, feel good” is, in fact, true. When a person looks good, people likely pay attention to him, which in turn boosts internal confidence. So, it is crucial to pay attention to one’s appearance including his or her beauty, clothes, haircut and so forth. Which is why, people go to great expense in complexion, flattering outfit, elegant hair style.
All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume that appearance matters in this superficial society. People, therefore, should spend a substantial amounts of money so that they look elegant.

Childhood obesity is becoming a serious problem in many countries.
Explain the main causes and effects of this problem and suggest some possible solutions.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1: 
Today, childhood obesity is one of the most pressing issues in many developed countries. Several factors, such as poverty, cheap junk food, and unhealthy lifestyle and so forth, lie in the phenomenon. The government has to make policy in order to grapple with the problem.
For a start, poverty is the root cause of childhood obesity. Poor families fail to feed their children the fruit and vegetables vital to their nourishment, and tend to rely on cheap and convenient alternatives. To cap it all, the natural way of feeding infants has been died out. A mounting body of studies shows that breastfeeding reduces the risk of overweight and obesity in childhood. Apart from that, the era of junk foods and video games has spawned new generation; the overweight children whose eating habits and play are altogether different than the children a bygone era. Nowadays, children are indulged their taste for junk foods and they spend their leisure time by playing video games or watching TV cartoons. They reluctant to engage in physical activities, which in turn cause the obesity in childhood.
However, the government should take necessary action to curb the obesity in childhood. First of all, the tax should be imposed on junk foods, and also the fruit and vegetables are ought to be subsidized heavily.  This by consequence will create a condition conducive to relying on healthy foods.  Secondly, the government should also mount a campaign to encourage breastfeeding. Last but not the least, physical activity and education should be emphasized in primary and junior secondary school curriculum.
To recapitulate, the rise in childhood obesity has become grave public health concern. Cheap junk foods and modern lifestyle are contributing to the obesity in childhood. The subsidy of health foods could be silver bullet for this problem.
Sample Answer 2: 
Childhood obesity is a concerning issue across the world, especially for the parents having overweight kids. The rate has been doubled comparing to past 30 years and the children are experiencing excessive weight even before they reach their adolescence or get admitted at school. It happens mostly for the imbalance of calorie in the body. Besides, several other pushing factors are also liable in making the kids obese.
Unhealthy eating behavior is considered as the top most important factor behind the overweight among the kids below 10 years. With the advancement of the world, everyone, including the parents, is getting busier and thus they (the parents) are unable to maintain a healthy diet pattern in the family. Absence of physical activities is also associated here. As people lack the chances to burn the calories they take in and accordingly gain too much pounds. Besides, the surrounding environment is also responsible for their unhealthy lifestyle.
More to the point, the children in different countries have fewer choices to get healthy foods in their menu. Most of the time they are to intake foods with high calories, sugars, fat and salt which are filled with less nutrients for their body and growth. Further, the children are more prone to watch television for longer hours. As a result, they remain inactive which helps to increase the risk of getting weighty.
So, when the children turn heavier than their age and height, there are likely to suffer from long and short term health disorders. They develop more chances to be victimized by cardiovascular diseases and stroke earlier than the other kids. Often they are diagnosed with high blood pressure or higher cholesterol level. Diabetes is another shocking factor for them while they may also be affected with bone or joint disorders. Cases have been found that obese kids suffer from psychological disorders.
In conclusion, it is appears that the prevention of childhood obesity is not a big deal. Changing the food habits may reduce the problem to a greater level. The obese children should be inspired to have home-made low caloric foods. Fruit and vegetable intakes with plenty of clean water (instead of sweetened beverage) should also be added on the diet list. A change in the daily routine with an hour of physical activity is a must for them. Outdoor sports may be the best suited one as those are enjoyable and help burning calories easily.

Crime rate is increasing against the young women. Who is to blame? What are the possible solutions?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
It is common to hear and read the news of crime against women. They continue to suffer soon after their birth till they die. They are victimised in the countless way: eve teasing, harassment, domestic violence, dowry, murder, suicide, and rape are few of them. To remove this blot from our society, we need to look deep into the causes of this darkness.
In my mind, our misguided culture, low literacy rate among women and the inactive government are the causative factors. Male should be dominative, girls does not have right to be educated, they should work inside their houses, dowry is the right of a groom’s family and many other customs are being blindly followed by us since time unknown. On the top of this, our paralyses police, law and government system turns blind eye to all these crimes, because of this offenders easily escape after committing offense.
We need to empower the female gender. Free and compulsory education till the age of 15, and then the low interest rates of loans and scholarships for higher education would be very effective. This will break their dependency on male gender. Moreover, the government and non-governmental organisations should work tirelessly to bring the cultural change in the society. In addition, legislative amendments and strict execution of laws would   bring the fear in the minds of criminals. Besides these, women should also learn some tactics to combat the criminals for their own safety.
In conclusion, history of developed countries clearly indicates that no society can progress, if they subdue the rights of women. And also teaches that, sooner or later women would succeed in claiming their rights, how challenging it may be.

Life now is better than it was 100 years ago.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Undoubtedly, life is better now than the earlier century, and people started having more simplicity in their life in the current days that they even could not have imagined before. Life is made simple. Everything has been changed and modernized. So, it should be acknowledged that in the current age, people are enjoying the benefits of science and technology and by the same time have developed them in almost all of the arenas. But about 100 years ago, there were no such advancements and in fact life was miserable (in many cases).
Presently, advancements have touched almost all the sectors ranging from healthcare to outer space research. Humans have achieved tremendous success in most of the important sectors like education, economics, science, communication, technology etc. Consequently, the living standards have reached to their peak. With the beginning of modernization, old stuff has been outdated while the newer inventions have replaced them.
To take example, the improvement of communication may help to get a clear concept over the entire topic. Earlier, communications was the most troublesome issue for majority of the global populations. Often they had to travel a long distance on their feet due to poor communication system. But now, the scenario is just the opposite. Communication has been made stronger and easier. One can now communicate with the remotest part of the world with a few mouse clicks. Travelling is also made easier with the invention of wide number of transportation modes.
The improvement of medical science should also be counted as the indicator to improvement. People used to die in the last century even on the slightest health disorder. But now the death and disease rate has been reduced to a notable extent. The improved medical science is able to battle even with the deadly disease like cancer.
So, to wrap up, the modern age has improved life than the past. Living has become easier by dint of science and technology which have developed in the current age. Moreover, experts believe that life would be easier in the next century and imaginations also may come true.

The success of a business or sports team depends on the leader of that team than on the individual team members. This is because it is the leader who makes sure everyone works together to achieve the team’s goals.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Success for a team or business indisputably lies on compliance with the instructions passed by the leader. Without the directives of a leader, it is unfeasible for the ordinary employees or team members to achieve success because they are ignorant in many cases and lack insights like the leader. The leader helps the employees or team members to perform all their tasks smoothly and coordinates among all the relevant processes so that the goals could be achieved in due time, perfectly.
In the present world, it is impossible to deny the contributions of the other team members to reach the goals but without the presence and directives of a leader, the team is like a sailing boat without radar. A leader is able to communicate effectively and engages all the relevant team members of staffs in different tasks. He leads all the activities. He plans. He breaks down the tasks into pieces and engages the relevant player of staff to perform that specific duty. As a result, success follows the leader everywhere.
The leader always influences and inspires his/ her mates to reach any specific goal. It is natural that people prefer to have appreciation from the higher authority which helps them get inspirations. The leader usually inspires them in every situation, either good or bad. He is with his team. Due to a poor performance, the employees or team members may require some motivation which is provided by the leader. Consequently, working spirit gets a boost.
On the other side, imagine that there is no leader. Everyone is working all by themselves. At the end of the day, the production level goes to substandard level. It is natural as well. Usually team members require some monitoring. The leader plays the role of monitor. With the idea of being monitored, a sense of accountability arises inside the member which drives them performing their respective tasks carefully. The chances for perfection get increased.
Finally, to conclude the essay, it should be agreed that the importance of leaders in achieving any specific goals cannot be ignored. It is also evident that the success is always depending on the leader. Without a leadership, it is impossible to move on the right track and there are several chances to lose ways or get defeated. Leaders have developed their senses of performing the right thing at the right time and they are skilled at manipulating the team mates or associates. Their sense of instinct, communication, judgment etc. all are improved and help doing the right thing both in sports and business.

Artists should be allowed to show their talents, the government should not restrict their creativity.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
Art is the demonstration of human creativity. It has been playing paramount role in every facet of our private, social, and national life. That is why, many people argue that the government should pave the way for artists so that they can exhibit their talents. In my opinion, the government ought to create an atmosphere conducive for the artist, rather confine their creativity.
Arts and culture brings enormous benefits to individuals, society, and nation as a whole. Arts and culture ignite creativity and innovation. Not only does it spark creativity, but also individuals embrace arts and culture to relieve their stress. Apart from that, arts and culture also have social impact. They are the key component of a vibrant society. Whether they act explicitly through the social events associated with artists, or implicitly by inspiring the civic participation of people, arts and artists play a significant role in community development. For instance, the researchers of University of Pennsylvania revealed that the high concentration of cultural activities foster the sense of a community embracing all classes. The artists, thus, use their arts as a conduit for civic engagement.
Likewise, artists can promote tourism industry of a country, which in turn will create myriad job opportunities. Eventually, many people would ameliorate their living standard, and can contribute to the GDP. Thus, the artists could be useful for a robust economy. In addition to this, the artists can demonstrate cultural heritage of a nation. Which by consequence bring forth an automatic sense of harmony that strengthens the country’s unity.  So, the artists also contribute to the national arena.
In pithy, the artists are the persons who perpetuate the progress of a nation. Based on above discussion, the government should support the artist for blooming the arts.
Sample Answer 2:
Art is the unique form to express one’s inner thoughts and feelings while an artist can reflect those in very special ways. Generally artists are born with extraordinary talents but when the government tries to impose or restrict their talents, the process greatly hampers the mental advancement of the nation.
Currently, art is present everywhere. What we do is an art. What we think is an art. Even, what we wear is an art as well. But not everyone can be an artist. It requires extra attention and talents to be an artist. The range of art is not limited to any subject matters or in music, painting or cultural activities. It is spread in everywhere. People who are artist just perform the acts in their distinctive ways. They think different, speak different and act unusually.
But when the government imposes over them, for instance an unkind ruler is ordering a band group to compose a song favoring him or his government; the real meaning of art is hampered. When not performed accordingly, the government/ ruler may start pondering over blocking their ‘strange’ activities. Currently, some of the states are systematically removing arts and artists from their societies but it should not be done. If it is done, at the end of the day, it is the government who will suffer for the want of creativity.
Artists are considered as the free thinkers of a society. They are enriched with creative ideas which all aim to improve the society, community and the mankind. Each of the art forms has some educative values and those are represented in the artists’ activities. Thereby, when a government is planning to obstruct the artists’ activities, simply it points that the government is unaware about the serious damages of state’s innovative resources which could be used for the advancement.
Finally, it appears that a government wants to remove art and artists when they do not favor the state rules or policies. But it should be kept in mind that creativity is different from the ordinary matters and may not always follow rules. When the creativity will be blocked, the nation will lag behind in terms of art, culture and education. Advancement will be stopped. Thereby, it is imperative for any government not to impose or restrict the creative activities by the artists.

Some people think government should subsidies food and vegetables to make healthy food cheaper. Other argues that tax should be set on unhealthy food.
Discuss both views and gives your opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
Obesity, particularly childhood obesity, is one of the pressing issues in many countries across the globe. That is why, some people urge government to subsidise food and vegetables to make healthy food affordable. In contrast, others argue that government ought to tax on unhealthy food to fight obesity. From my point of view, while government ought to subsidise to make organic food reasonable, imposing tax on unhealthy food should also be encouraged.
Our society has brought forth tainted economic incentive. The cost of junk food, over the time, has become less expensive compared to the cost of healthy food such as fruits, vegetable, milk, and so forth. To put it another way, our economic mechanism offers the logical choice a glass of sugar-sweetened beverage in lieu of a glass of milk. Right here there is enormous value in taxing on unhealthy food. By raising the cost, we can make convenient for people to make the more healthful selection. Furthermore, the tax money could be used in raising awareness about detrimental effects of unhealthy foods as well as to subsidise the healthy foods.
Again, healthy food subsidies can result in healthier food consumption. Healthier foods often remain higher priced, especially some items are prohibitively expensive that most people cannot afford it. If government grants subsidy to healthy foods, then the masses will tend to purchase and consumption of healthier foods. A case in point is a recent study, which showed that subsidy is an effective way to promote healthier foods.
In my opinion, both the subsidy to healthier foods and the tax on unhealthy foods are effective at encouraging people to purchase healthier food. Researchers from University of Otago, University of Auckland, Wellington delved into the association between food pricing strategies, food consumption, and refractory diseases. They found that a 10% increase in the price of junk foods could decline consumption by 1% to as much as 24%. On the other hand, a 10% cut in the price of fruits and vegetables could rise consumption by 2% to 8%. So, government should adopt both the approaches.
In fine, a great number of population is overweight or obese in our country. I, therefore, believe that tax or surcharge on foods high in saturated fats and fizzy drinks, and subsidies for fruits and vegetables could drive people to have better diet, which by consequence will help us get rid of obesity.

Some people believe that bicycles are the best mode of transport in the cities, others disagree.
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both views and give your own opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
Bicycle is a wonderful mode of transportation known to man. Many people believe that nothing compares to the utility of this simple transportation in the traffic-ridden cities, others refute the notion, although. To my way of thinking, bicycle is simply awesome as it helps curb traffic congestion and air pollution as well.
The antagonists of bicycle argue that it cannot carry many people at a time, yet creates obstacles for other transports or vehicles. They go on saying that hundreds of people are wounded or maimed in cycle accidents every week. So, there is severe security concern associated with bicycle. Moreover, bicycles are not a good choice as a reliable mode of transport when the weather is adverse. Furthermore, biking can cause pain. Cyclists have to utilize their lower back in order to power and control the cycle. Consequently, back pain is common in cyclists.
The proponents of bicycles, on the other hand, stress the need for bicycles in the city life. They argue that bicycles are the most useful form of transport to combat against traffic gridlock as well as environmental damages, as many cities are suffering from traffic jam due to the increasing number of private cars or other modes of vehicles. Bicycles are tiny and need less space on the road, therefore, cycles could be the key tool curbing traffic congestion. Apart from that, it does not need gasoline, which means that cycles do not exhaust toxic fumes into the environment. So, not only does it reduce traffic jam, but also cycle does not cause meaningful pollution at the time of operation.
In fine, the gridlock situation in the city roads tend to tilt towards bicycles. I agree with the people who argue that cycles are the best form of transport. Since it brings forth no toxic fumes and also good for health averting obesity.

Nowadays air travel is cheaper than in the past. Is this a positive or a negative development?
Discuss and give your own opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
In the past, flying used to be a thing only for affluent society. Now the airfare is cheaper than ever before, and it paves the way for the ordinary people to fly, which in turn helps poverty reduction. But, there is also negative impact on environment. That is why, some people consider the economical flight as boon, while others refute the claim. In my opinion, I think affordable fare is conducive to flourishing the economy.
To commence with, cheap air travel can damage environment both directly and indirectly. Aviation is immensely polluting mode of transport on the earth. The complex chemical reactions that occur when fuel is burnt at high altitude causes emissions from airliner almost four times as harmful as those at the ground level. The environmental damage continues when the substantial sums of tourists visit tourist land depleting natural resources.
On the flipside, reasonable airfare means more people are able to travel by aircraft. Which by consequence would boost the tourism industry. As a result, the industry can offer myriad opportunities for employment creation as well as local economic development. A substantial number of unemployed population can get rid of the unbearable poverty in consequence of job opportunities. Apart from that, many can move to abroad for better wage and can send remittance to their homeland. If the policymakers can offer mechanism and incentive for migrants and their families to invest the remittances in capital-accumulation projects, then it will perpetuate economic growth of the country.
Summing all of the above, it could easily concluded that cheaper air flight is a positive development despite its negative impact on environment.

A recent study showed that both developed and developing countries prosper because of the economic growth. People from developing countries are happier than before while people from developed countries are not as happy as they were in the past.
Why is this happening? How can this situation be improved?
Give your opinion including relevant examples and your own experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer: 
The economic growth and work force due to the globalization have made it possible for both the developed and developing countries to use their potential and progress the overall condition of the country. Many developing countries in Asia has sown better progress than many already developed countries and the overall job sectors, GDP and life expectancy in the world have improved. Yet a subtle difference is prominent between the developed and developing countries and that it terms of being happy. It seems that people in less developed countries are leading better and happy life than that of technologically and economically advanced countries.
There are many reasons that can attribute to that difference and from my point of view, the family bonding and social structure is the utmost important factor for creating this. People in developing countries have a better family bonding and this is one of the most important factors for having a happy life. On the other hand, the family bonding in economically advanced countries have dropped and people lead life of their own and in their last phase of life, they have no other alternative than to love in an old home. This makes a huge difference.
Again the social culture and mentality of being happy with limited resources make a big difference among the people of these two types of countries. While people in less developed countries have learned to be satisfied with whatever resources they have and share those with their family members, people in developed countries do the opposite. Their expectation to amass a billion and then having no one to share is a very bad trend.
Finally, job stress and busy life in fast world countries are often the reason people suffer from stress related issue. The technological advancement, busy life, huge competition and social structure have bound them to lead a life that has scarcity of time for someone himself.
To improve the situation first and foremost the family bonding is required. Without it we become alone and helpless. The lifestyle and social structure should be reformed to address this issue. People should feel the need for socialising and personal time. Dependency on technology should be reduced to a modest level to have time for family and friends. They should compare with the old good time they had and learn from the lessons taught in the history.
In conclusion, the happiness is a mental state and some variable factors can affect it including family bonding and social structure. The time has come for the first world countries to stop working like robots and look for the real ingredients of life.

Directors and managers of organization are often older people. Some people say that it is better for younger people to be leaders.
To what extend do you agree or disagree?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
Gone are the days when older people were seemed to be ideal for leading an organization. But, now it has become an outmoded fashion as young leadership has proved their worth. Some people, therefore, believe that organizations should pave the way for young leadership. To my way of thinking, leadership has no business with age. So, if a young man deserve the leadership, he should be rewarded it.
For a start, leadership knows no age as it is an inborn trait. Leaders are the individuals who have innate ability to encourage others to realize their real potential, make people confident, and invoke the sense of responsibility. Most importantly, leaders possess the attitude that they want to be in the front of others. They tend to confront challenges and are ready to face any bitter experience. Another key thing to remember is that the leaders have the intrinsic acumen that they can think promptly and can make good judgment without experience or beyond their age. Thus, age does not matter for preferring leadership.
In addition, the era we live in is the epoch of technology. Modern technology prevails in each and every workplace around the world. In this technology-driven workplace, young leadership can streamline an organization comparing to their counterpart. This is because, youngsters are usually tech-savvy, and they are more comfort with the technology than the older generation. So, young people, in this era of technology, are only able to contemplate a clear vision of how an organization will develop in the coming future.
In fine, age does not matter to lead an organization. Furthermore, technology has made it difficult for aged population to lead. Based on above discussion, it could be concluded that corporations should choose young generation who will decide how the business will be led tomorrow.
Sample Answer 2:
Globally this is a very usual trend that organizations choose senior people to execute the roles of directors or managers for some special reasons, and the key cause is their experience and expertise. But there are some other views that young people are better to suit the positions. Of course, the young people should be shouldered responsibilities as managers or directors to run an organization and demonstrate their talents.
Most of the young people are aged around 22 – 25 years when they enter as entry level employee while the directors or managers are aged at least 10 – 15 years more than them. Due to the age difference, the senior people have gained more experiences and now are on the leading positions. But the time when they started their career everything was not as tougher as it is in the current days. Most of the junior employees have to go through several complex tests and only the people with proven skills are employed.
With the advancement of time, technology and civilization, the junior employees start mastering some specific real-life issues like communications, respect to others, handling troublesome situations, enriched moral values, simplifying the complexities, understanding life to its deepest meaning, prompt decision making etc. from an early age which are the key skills required to run an organization or to be a leader. However, they might make some unplanned mistakes as well, but who does not make mistakes?
Moreover, the young people are naturally inquisitive and they love to discover newer ways to perform their assigned tasks. If they are assigned with higher obligations, surely they will try to perform their best one by investing their natural instincts. Initially they may need some guideline but most of the youths are quick learners and take less time to get familiar with the duties and responsibilities.
So, to wrap up the discourse, the young people should be allowed to perform some advanced tasks of an organization. The senior people are expert in performing their respective functions while it is their moral duty to transfer their knowledge and skills to the youths for the betterment of the organization. It would be unethical if they hold the office forever. The youth leadership should be accepted and with the passage of time these youths will be considered as asset for the organization.

Some people think social and vocational skills are as important as academic qualifications.
To what extent do you agree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
The globalization and the shift to service-based economy has made the acquisition of social and vocational skills more important than ever before. Consequently, some people theses competencies are as vital as academic qualification. From my perspective, I think that the idea indeed squares with the job demand.
Globalization has changed the nature of organizations removing national boundaries, thereby gaining the opportunity to connect teams and expand business around the world. As a result, a growing number of distributed teams are working cross-culturally. However, conflicts often occur about work methods, projects and assignments, group goals, and workloads. So, team members with good social skills are better equipped to deal those issues, to listen and comprehend different perspectives, and to devise solutions to the problems in mutually beneficial ways, and an executive with the competences works his way up the corporate ladder. For instance, recent studies show that social skills, for example being able to communicate effectively and lead a team as well as being multi-functional, having the appropriate level of self-esteem, and so on, are becoming more crucial in determining a distinguished career.
Likewise, vocational skills are key to the successful career in the service-based economy. The service sectors are booming day by day. As a result, many vocational skills are now in great demand, particularly among medical professionals, financial service, and food service. A recent study, conducted by the Edge foundation and City & Guides, revealed that for the first time about 75% employers now deem vocational qualifications as being just as important as their academic alternative.
In pithy, the nature of both the organization and the function has been changed with the globalization and service-based economy. This change has clear the way for the employees armed with social and vocational skills to obtain a successful career. So, there is no doubt in my mind that vocational and social competencies are as crucial as academic qualifications.
Sample Answer 2:
Undoubtedly the views over the importance of social and vocational skills cannot be denied and the skills are indeed essential as like the academic skills are needed in life. There are no chances to disagree with the statement about the importance of vocational and social skills. A good number of reasons could be placed backing the statement.
Social and vocation skills are essential to be a good member of the society and to become successful in someone’s professional life. For instance, a man is highly educated and has many academic degrees while most of the degrees belong to foreign universities. But the man has no social skills. He does not know how to meet or greet people. He is unable to comply with any unexpected real life situations. Even he fails to reply against any sudden question. So, surely one has nothing much to do with the higher degrees pursued from foreign universities. But if he had the social skills in line with the academic activities, it would have been better for him. The social and vocational skills motivate a person to help others in need. He will even do better in his professional life.
In certain cases, it has been found that only academic skills make people caged with the theories and they do not know how to deal with the real life situation. One of my cousins, Robert, is fond of books and academically he is sound and his performances are outstanding. But simply if he is asked to bring some necessary items from the nearby grocery, he is unable. He lacks the social skills. Thus I have real doubt about his professional success in the future. Another example may make it comprehensible. Imagine you need to repair your personal computer. But you do not have idea how to open the CPU casing and you asked for a professional. The professional who comes to repair the computer certainly owns some vocational skills. Hiring a professional is expensive, I believe. But if you had the skill to repair a computer by yourself, you would have done that easily and could have cut the cost of hiring a professional.
Based on the arguments above, it could be summed up that only academic skills will make people unfit to live in the society. Without having some sort of command over social and vocational skills in life, it is tougher for people to move ahead. Thereby, social and vocational skills in line with the academic activities should be mastered for all for their own.

Employers now tend to prefer employees with good social skills in addition to good qualifications. Social skills are getting more and more important compared to qualifications.
Do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant example or experience you might have.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer: 
With rise in the number of companies in the market, it is becoming a herculean task for them to maintain their sales and productivity, hence they asses employees’ social skill besides, educational qualification. However, it would be superficial to say that these skills are given more emphasis than professional skills.
Civil skills of employees are directly or indirectly vital for success of the company. Good communication skills help to build up a positive reputation among its customers and this indirectly increases the client base, sales of the company and overall productivity. Also, qualities like team work, leadership, et cetera create a positive working environment among the worker of same level and higher level in the company, which is very crucial for its smooth functioning. Also, today’s corporate world is interdependent and in such situation interpersonal relations help to increase contacts of one firm with other. Finally, network of many multinational companies would fail if they do not hire employees with good social skills.
Alternatively, big firms cannot perform only on the basis of civil skills, field qualification is also essential. Ultimately quality work can only be carried out by professionals. Furthermore, it would be a financial burden on the organisation if they recruit person having a exceptional interpersonal skills without any knowledge about his/her profession. As to train them it would have to spend considerable amount of time and money. Hence, quality worker are also required to make profit in highly saturated markets at national and international level.
In conclusion, I fully agree with the notion that the trend is shifting towards appointing people with greater social skills though the importance of educational qualification cannot be undermined. One without other cannot deliver results.

Genetic engineering is an important issue in modern society. Some people think that it will improve people’s lives in many ways. Others feel that it may be a threat to life on earth.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Essay :
In this twenty first century, the world is on the edge of a scientific revolution that causes one of the most controversial phenomena of all time: genetic engineering that manipulates an organism’s gene to alter nature and structure of genes. It is a powerful, yet potentially dangerous tool. The advocates of genetic engineering contend that it could uplift human lives in many aspects, while others deem that it will cause disastrous consequence threaten life on earth. However, I am of the honest opinion is that it is morally wrong that will be fatal to human civilization.
To begin with, genetic engineering is a boon to agriculture. It can boost production, taste and nutrition of crops in order to meet the increasingly demand of food for the overpopulated world. It can produce new variants with rich nutritional values and increased yield. In addition to this, engineered seed are pest-resistant and can adapt to harsh climatic and soil conditions. A case in point is plant genes At-DBF2, which can be embed into tomato and tobacco cells to increase their adaptability in harsh soil and climatic condition. Similarly, genetic engineering has the potential to treat several deadly diseases. Take “bubble boy” disease for example. In 1992, a girl was cured from the disease by transfusing copies of normal ADA enzyme.
On the flip side, genetic engineering may cause irrevocable damages for us. Genetic engineering is unable to know what the functions of each gene are. When a gene is removed for a cause, but it may have other vital roles to play which are unknown, then eventually it leads to disaster to our civilization. Similarly, the inserted gene may have other unknown functions. The effects of these unknown functions may emerge after a long period and that may cause immutable harm to mankind.
In my opinion, I would like to say that genetic engineering raises many concerns. These concerns stretch from ethical issues to lack of knowledge on the impacts genetic engineering may have. Genetic engineering seems to be god-like power. But god maintains a delicate balance into everything which is impossible to maintain for human being. If human beings interfere into this balance, then it would causes curse to mankind. The inadequate knowledge on gene’s complete function leads to some potential deadly effects that may be inherited before they are perceived.
In conclusion, Genetic engineering is a powerful, yet potentially very dangerous tool. As seen in the discussion, genetic engineering has many stunning advantages but it manipulates the natural world that actually outweighs its benefits to mankind.

Giving lectures in auditoriums to large number of students is an old way of teaching with technology available today there is no justification for it, and everything should be done online. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1: 
The traditional classroom where the teacher delivers lectures is becoming outmoded exponentially with the advent of cutting-edge technologies like, the Internet. Many educationalists contend that conventional classroom learning is no longer useful as much as online learning. In my opinion, I do not agree that online learning outweighs the traditional method of learning.
Students take a course because they need to comprehend the course content. In a traditional classroom setting, learners are face to face with a teacher, and in the most classes, the teacher delivers speech about the course content. At any point in the time, students can ask about what is confusing, and the teacher clarifies the concept of the topic. Students, thus, can communicate easily and get answer immediately. So, when it is the course the student knows nothing at all about, or he found difficulties in the past, then the conventional classroom setting is the better option for him.
In contrast, with an online class, students are offered set readings and projects, and are expected to learn the content on their own. Students need to email the teachers, or to post to a discussion board in order to ask questions, and they wait for the reply. This may slow down the learning, even if students are doing the readings and projects at a good pace. So, the online course can work well if a leaner takes the course he is comfortable with.
Personally, I do not admit with the notion that there is no justification for classroom setting, as it still is the best option for the students who know they need discipline to get the task completed. That is to say, the method provides the students with the support they need to clarify the concept, and to complete assignments or projects on a daily basis. That is why, I incline to the traditional classroom setting.
Summing all of the above, the students, especially the pupils who are unable to comprehend things easily, would be better off with the traditional way of learning in the physical classroom. Since, it offers opportunity to ask questions whenever the students feel difficulties and also provide them with prompt clarification.
Sample Answer 2: 
Education is the process to expand knowledge among people and lectures are done to spread the knowledge. In this age of globalization, giving lectures manually at an auditorium has become old-fashioned. Everything should be done online and there are some strong logic backing the issue.
It is acknowledged that lectures have some benefits but what if someone misses the lectures? There are no possible ways to arrange for the same lecture again and both the lecturers and students will disagree to sit for the same lecture twice. As a result, the student who missed the lecture for some unwanted reasons is unable to get the lecture. He may get the lecture sheets or notes on the lecture but once it is missed, it is gone forever.
But if the lesson is provided online, everyone does not need to be present at the right time. Rather the students could listen to the delivered lectures at their convenient time. They are having a great flexibility here. Yes, they may have issues to be clarified from the lectures, and there are several options to get clarification from the lecturers like chatting, discussion etc.
When someone attends a lecture on a large auditorium and appears on test over the same lecture, it is impossible for the lecturer to provide the results immediately. But in online lectures, one can have instant results! This is the unique feature of online education, and thus it is getting recognition in the current days. Besides, attending a college for some specific or special degrees for one or two years is really expensive but the costs are almost half for online education. It is also economic in the overall sense that a student needs to attend the classes regularly which will save energy, time and money for him/ her.
Finally, to wrap the discussion, all of the arguments above favor the decision for online lectures. If people follow the old practices even in this globalized world, they will lag behind in the race. So, the practice of online lectures should be promoted more by discarding the old-fashioned rules of lecturing in large auditoriums.

The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29 million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Write at least 250 words.
Give your opinion including relevant examples and your own experience.
Sample Answer 1: 
The year 1888 was propitious that the first automobile was appeared on the British road. But today, the thing has changed as the number of private vehicles on the roads may hit more than 29 million by the year 2000. The snippet has sparked off considerable debate and many people argue that alternative transports should be encourage and ought to be passed international laws in order to control car ownership and use. In the instance, I partially agree with the idea that encouraging alternative transports would be sensible, but controlling car ownership may cause economic recession.
For a start, the more private vehicles are on the roads, the more traffic congestion and environmental pollution are likely to increase. The increasing number of automobiles are overwhelming our city roads. Not only does it cause traffic gridlock, but also the increase in car use threatens environmental cataclysm. A good solution to the issue is to reduce the private vehicle use. To that end, the government should mount a campaign for using public transports since more people can travel by it, which in turn would decrease private cars as well as CO2 emission.
Again, the ever-cheaper cars are whetting individuals’ appetite for cars. Consequently, more and more people are buying cars. That is why, in many circles, it is argued that international laws ought to be introduced in order to restrict car ownership and use. In the case, my own position is rather different. Although the idea apparently seems feasible, it may impose a huge stain on the economy. So, I think international organization should fund the research projects for improving vehicles and fuels as well as introducing new efficient mobility options.
In fine, modern society are facing the dilemma regarding private vehicles. Individuals want to easy and cheap mobility, and they want to commute in comfort and style. But giving full rein to these desires may translate into social and environmental cataclysms. In order to reconcile private desire and public interest, the government should encourage people to use alternative forms of transport, and in tandem, the international institutions should lend its support to the research projects working for improving cars, fuels, and devising new mobility choices as well.
Sample Answer 2: 
The number of vehicles on British Roads is countless and since the appearance of motorized car in 1888, a wide number of motor vehicles are plying on the streets of Britain. Now this is the time to change the thoughts about transportation system and modes. Alternative transports should be inspired in line with the law to control the car ownership in the country. In fact the cars owned in private are the key causes for traffic congestion and several types of pollution.
In modern days, it is almost impossible to move without cars and in a country like Britain, this is nearly impossible to reach destinations without the help of a car. So, people have started owning cars for their personal use and on the other side creating troubles for the remaining other people without private cars. Again, due to excessive number of vehicles the roads are turning congested, especially during the peak hours of the day. Thereby, people most of the time get late for their respective tasks.
Most of the times, the cars are polluting the environment either by emitting smoke or by creating noise with their louder horns. To make people aware of their presence, the car drivers use the horns in crowd which is unbearable to many people. But if there were alternative transportation system, no such issues would have raised.
If there were alternative transports for the commoners instead of the private motor vehicles, it would have been easier to commute from place to place inside the city. Further, people would have travelled in speedy mode of transports. For instance, if an extra subway routes is created in line with the current subway system, many of the passengers would be greatly benefited. They would be able to reach their destinations within short time. Besides, international law over car ownership should also be implemented properly as now people are tending to get private cars. The law will discourage using private cars and inspire on alternative transports like bicycle, bus, subway or trains.
Finally, it is evident that the privately owned cars are the creator of troubles on the streets. But by the same time it also should be considered that people cannot do without cars. So, the best idea is that the number of alternative transports should be increased. It will help moving freely in the city. Similarly, the international law for car ownership should be implemented so that people could get inspiration in using alternative transport modes.

Some people believe that students should be allowed to evaluate and criticize their teachers to improve the quality of education. Others think it is disrespectful to teacher. 
Discuss both views, give your opinion and include relevant examples.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
How teachers’ performance should be assessed has sparked a heated debate among the educationists. Some educators thinks that the students ought to be allowed to appraise the teacher so as to elevate the quality of pedagogy, while others, on the other hand, believe that it would be discourteous to the teachers. In my opinion, I regard teachers’ evaluation by the pupil as insulting to the teacher.
The proponents of teacher assessment based on student feedback argue that more academic excellence could be achieved if the teachers are assessed by the students. Student evaluations can help the teachers improve. For example, when students will be permitted to rate the performance of a teacher based on a given questionnaire at the end of a term, the teacher, then, would be able to know his pitfall associated with his teaching style, which in turn help him develop his teaching method. In addition, the authority can make a right decision when it comes to reward the teachers that ultimately inspire them to devise the best methodology to convey their ideas to the pupils.
However, others express their disappointment with the teacher evaluation by the students. They deem it as a discourteous deed. They argue that teaching is not like other professions. Teachers are not service provider or students are not their clients. Respect is the bedrock of teacher-student relationship. The students can take advantage of teacher evaluation by them, which by consequence will harm the relationship. For instance, students may exploit the questionnaire form as a space to vent their frustration. So, there is a greater chance of unfair judgment, and the quality of education may deteriorate as a consequence of biased evaluation.
In conclusion, students’ rate on teachers’ performance cannot improve the quality of teaching, I believe. This is because, students are not matured, experienced enough to judge the teachers objectively. Although the evaluation may improve teaching quality to some extent for a while, students’ assessment can lead to teacher being targeted unfairly that may hinder teaching and learning in the long run.

Nowadays some families are moving to other countries because of their work. Is it a positive or a negative development? How does it impact their children’s life?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Human beings have been on move since the human life began. So, migration is not a new phenomenon, but the rapid development of globalization causes the increased mobility of people. This trend has a huge impact on development and the poor men, women, and children may benefit from migration.
To start with, migration can play a vital role in development. In generally, migrated workers can sent a considerable amount of money to their home country which is commonly known as remittance. With the remittance, the government of the home country can run many development projects that improve the infrastructure of the country. In these development projects, the unemployed people can be employed and can improve their living standard. In addition, the government can initiate several human resource development programs. And it is needless to say that developed infrastructure and developed human resource always increase trade and attracts foreign investments. Thus, migration has a great impact on development.
Likewise, migration helps people to come out from poverty and increase their income, learn new skills, improve their social status, can obtain assents and can improve their quality of life. Consequently, they are able to pay attention to their children. They can ensure education for their children and also pay attention to children’s food and nutrition. The migrated families also can provide better health care facilities. Broadly, these families are able to ensure a better future for their children.
To in a nut shell, globalization creates huge opportunities for migrating. Poor families can now migrate to the developed countries and thus can change their fate and can pursue a better future for their children. Undoubtedly, migration is a great boon to the poor families and for their children.

Some parents think that childcare centres provide the best services for children of pre-school age. Other working parents think that family members such as grandparents will be better carers for their kids.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Child care centres play a phenomenal role in this fast pace and busy society. In many circles, it is seemed as the best possible option for working parents, because these centres cater the best services for the tiny toddlers. By contrast, others believe that family members such as grandparents are the right agent as a care giver for their children. Although both the arguments have its own justifications, I am of my honest opinion that childcare centres are the undeniable reality for working parents.
Child care by grandparents offers many advantages such as the chance to build a strong family bonding, reduced costs, and the reassurance that comes from knowing a trusted and loving member is caring for your child. Grandparents, no doubt, have a plenty of experience when it comes to raising children and I am living proof of this. My grandmother rears me that I am what she made me, though she indulged me on odd occasions sometimes. She never made me feel the absence of my busy working parents. However, parents can also save money from child care by grandparent that they no longer need to pay the cost of child care centres. Most importantly, it assures a sense of satisfaction that the children are raised and being learnt many values by the trusted and loving persons. So, family members such as grandparents do play a crucial role in child care.
However, the number of nuclear families and working parents is high that they have no alternative than to depend on child care centres and these centres also ensure the best services for children, particularly pre-school age. According to 2010 U.S. census data, approximately 70 percent of children live within a nuclear family unit. This survey clearly shows the fact that parents can no longer rely on other family members. Apart from that in child care centres, children get the opportunities to build relationships and to make interactions, conducive environment and are kept in healthy and safe. It is most important for a child in the early years is to experience a caring and responsive relationship with at least one adult, and as he or she get older, to have relationship with other toddlers. Child care centres cater meaningful and respectful conversations and interactions with adults and peers. The environment is also conducive for children’s cognitive and motor skills. The materials provided for children are encouraged to explore, think and solve problems. More importantly, most child care centres’ prime concerns is to maintain children’s health and keep them in safe. Therefore, child care centres are the better option for working parents in the advanced society.
From what has been discussed above, I would like to prefer child care centres due to its services and the demand of reality.

Some people think that teenagers who commit crimes should be treated the same way as adult criminals.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Nowadays, it tends that adult crimes are being committed at a faster pace by teenagers. In many circles, it is argued that a same treatment as that for adults should be fair enough for young offenders who commit serious crimes. However, personally I think it is not justified at all that you hold an idea that a teen deserve the same manner and fashion as an adult does.
To start with, no child younger than 17 be trialed and sentence as an adult. At these ages, teenagers are likely to be considerably less culpable than their adult counterparts and substantially more vulnerable to the harsh condition of adult prisons. The case of Zachary Proper plays a good example here. The boy, who was charged with killing his grandparents and was sentenced to 35-80 years, committed suicide in an adult prison in Pennsylvania. Therefore, what I want to say that is we have to acknowledge that children must be prosecuted differently in the American legal system, recognizing the incomplete maturity, reduced impulse control, and reduced ability to understand long-term consequences.
While teenagers, particularly 18-years-olds, are obviously capable of handling many adult responsibilities, there are considerable evidences that shows young adults are not fully, emotionally mature. That is to say that teen’s intellectual ability approaches average adult levels around age 18, but at the same time, their psychological maturity is well below adult levels until the mid-20s. In fact, it is a third period in the maturation process where teens are no longer children, but not yet adults. Thus, youngsters are too immature to be subject to the adult criminal justice system.
In fine, we must fit the rights of children with public safety.  This is our prime importance obviously. But continuation of transferring teens like Zachary Proper to the adult criminal justice system simply invites another tragic incident. Zachary’s story tells us what happens to youngsters when we wrong-headedly treat them as adult. The tragedies will only continue if we do not begin to truly treat teens like teens!

Some people believe that history is very important and we must study the past to understand the present. Other say that it has little or no use at all.

Discuss both views, give your opinion and support it with relevant examples.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
History, in common parlance, is the record of the past events. In many circles, history is considered as an important tool by which people can comprehend people, while others say that history does not matter. Although there are good arguments against the importance of history, I personally believe that history plays a crucial role apprehending the present situation.
On the one hand, it can be argued that history has a faint function or no use at all in the present context. The proponents of this argument contend that the present situation, most often, is different from the past events. The experiences that history share us have very little worth or relevance in the present context. Moreover, in many cases, histories are recorded with different motivations and personal biasness influenced it largely. Consequently, history might misleads people. Therefore, studying history is nothing but wasting of time and money.
On the other hand, there are people who believe that history is the key to understand the current situation and the world in which he or she lives. I subscribe the view for several reasons. History is the account of past events, and present is constituted by the past events. So, if one wants to comprehend present situation accurately, he or she have to delve into the history. For example, people can understand the spirit of modern democratic state only when they study the history of French Revolution as it unified French and inaugurated the epoch of modern state. Besides, our society is crammed with complex cultures, heritages, or traditions have not been emerged on the spur of the moment. It has been formed with the practice of generations. So, if one is keen to understand the present condition of society or human beings, he or she has to visit history.
In pithy, I want to say that each individual is born with a personal distinction of an inherited genetic template, known as the genome, which has developed during the entire life span of human species. And history acts as a conduit between past and present that allows people to understand the facts of past events, which in turn helps comprehend the present better. There is no doubt that when we have a lucid comprehension of past and present, we can build a bright future on it. So, history is not just useful for present, but for future as well.

Computers have made the world a better place to live.
Do you agree or disagree with the statement?
Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer: 
The present world is called the world of technology and it is mostly because of the wonders the computer technology has given us. In every step and arena of life we use and rely on computers including traffic control, modern education system, treatment, running a bank, sending a satellite to the outer space and so on and on. There are very few sectors and job places in the world that have not been modernize from the blessing of the innovation of computers. Yet, there are some negative aspects of the advancement and dependency in computers and which is pointed by a group of people as the devastating side effect of computers. Like every technology and advancement the computer has created some negative effects, no doubt, but the overwhelming advancement it has offered makes it pretty negligible and without any debate computer has made the world a better place for us.
First, according to an army of people, computer technology has made us less sociable who in fact themselves have a large number of Facebook and Twitter friends. They also argue that computers are replacing a huge number of jobs and creating unemployment. But they fail to consider the booming in job sectors due to the computing technology. More than several millions of people are directly or indirectly relying on computer technology in their job field. Other may argue the health effect of computers but this is not a fault of the technology itself. Rather it depends on our lifestyle and willingness to live a healthy life. People who are working in mine, petroleum and other nuclear sectors are much more exposed to the health hazards.
Consider your daily life where computers have made things easier and faster. People no longer need to do the manual and tedious jobs and rely on computers to have these jobs done immaculately. Risky job sectors like mining are replacing humans with computers and that is a blessing for us. We now have better treatment facility, better crime detection method, better weather and natural calamity forecast to save the lives of millions and that has all been possible because of the marvel of this technology. The researches in foods and healthcare system, education system, accommodation, costume and trade have make the world a global village where impossible is nothing.
In short, we can consider some very trifling side effects of computer technology and outcry the damage it has caused while the truth is this technology is a blessing for the human being and has offered us an advanced society with better lifestyle and limitless possibilities.

People tend to watch foreign movies more than local movies these days. Should government financially support local movies?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:

The world we live in has become a global village. In this era of globalization, national boundaries are becoming increasingly meaningless in the global economy. Consequently, there are plenty of foreign movies in our country and people incline to the foreign movies, particularly Hollywood movies. Some people opine that the government should financially support local movies. In this instance, I completely agree with the notion that it will help to grapple with cultural aggression.
To start with, foreign movies, especially Hollywood movies, are usually big-budget movies. These big-budget spectacle movies are designed for exciting watching experience with impressive graphics, explosions, and actions. As a result, these films have a competitive edge over local movies, and the local movies cannot compete with the heavily promoted movies that the sophisticated film industries produce. That is why, the government should financially support for thriving national film industry.
In addition, visual media like movies exert a powerful influence more than any other cultural forms. It may change or spoil values or norms of society. That is to say, foreign movies introduce exotic culture that is not compatible to the local culture, which in turn harms unity of the society. On the top of that, these movies tend to export cultural hegemony to other countries. For example, in Hollywood film, American hegemony is used as a widely accepted cultural norm that is depicted in a film. Youngsters, in our country, are prone to eat American burger which is even harmful to our body. So, our local movies ought to be supported financially by the government in order to grapple with cultural hegemony exported by foreign movies.
From what has been discussed above, it is clear that the local movies should be heavily subsidized by the government as films are the flagship of creative arts that can prevent cultural hegemony, while fuels national unity nurturing culture and tradition.

Some people say that public libraries should be free, otherwise they are just a waste of money, especially because modern technologies and the internet allow easy access to resources.

Discuss and give your point of view.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Libraries have been playing a tremendous role in building human civilization. However, with the explosive growth of information technologies, people have easy access to the ocean of information at anytime, anywhere. Therefore, some people come to the point that libraries should be free, otherwise it would be just waste of money. In this instance, I, to some extent, agree with the statement given.
It seems that the early twenty first century is the age of information technology that no epoch ever dreamt of. There is huge information available on the internet for anyone to use. Moreover, we are able to save gigantic databases including books, thesis papers, journals, chronicles and other important works such as history and researches related to several fields easily and quickly with help of modern sophisticated technologies. Take internet as an example: people with just few mouse clicks can get and save any kind of information in the blink of an eye at their convenient place and time. Consequently, people no longer need to spend money on membership of public library. So, in many circles, it is argued that should be free, otherwise it is just a waste of money.
However, I do not fully agree with the view that it is just waste of money, though I feel that public libraries should be free. First of all, public libraries are the place where the environment is quite conducive for reading. For instance, I always prefer public library for reading quietly. Secondly, public libraries are becoming dynamic place day by day. That is to say that it is seeking to engage the community, instead of simply providing a place to read or borrow books. It acts like a hub of community. Last but not the least, public libraries always provide reliable books and professional resources unlike the information available on the internet. In many cases, it is pretty difficult to distinguish authentic information from the huge pile of unanimous information and any false information may lead to very serious consequences. On the other hand, public libraries should be free just because knowledge is power and libraries are the place from where people can get knowledge. So, it must be free to build a powerful nation.
To reiterate, I would like say that the core mission of public libraries is to encourage and foster new readers, and promote communities of readings, while the modern digital world can never supersede this core motto. So, public libraries are still playing significant role in our daily life and it must be free for the sake of building a powerful nation.

Some people consider sport to be their carrier and role in the society. For others it is mostly a workout to keep fit. 
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Nowadays, sports tend to become more popular due to its role in health and career. Some people are now passionate to choose sports as a career. In contrast, it is viewed as only lifestyle by others that keep body fit and healthy. In this essay, I will explore both the views with my own opinion.
To start with, there is not a single shed of doubt that sports help people to be healthy and fit. Sports are good for the musculoskeletal system making muscles more flexible and toned, and improving the strength of bones and joints. That is to say that sports make people stronger and they will be more capable to lift and carry heavy things and people are less likely to become weak and frail as they get older due to their strong and fit body. In addition, sports are very useful for people with depression or any other mental issues because it releases good chemicals into our brains. Sports, thus, are good exercises that keep us physically and mentally sound.
However, sports have become a popular vogue in choosing career in modern society. Successful sports individuals can get a celebrity image very easily. And their salaries are higher than any other well paid professionals.
Professional athletes most often have an undeniable influence on the purchasing decision of their fans. The fans want to adopt the traits of the fast, strong players, and are most likely an excellent target market for the advertisers that they use such players to promote their products. David Beckham plays a good example here: he is an important socialisation agent and has a significant impact on purchasing behaviours and intentions. Sports as a profession, thus, help people to a cozy life and play an influential role in society as well. Considering these arguments, I would like to contend that sports would be a lofty profession undoubtedly.
In fine, sports is essential for us that it keeps us physically and mentally fit. However, I want to emphasize sports as career, because recent trends testimony that it could be an excellent profession that is argued above. Not all people are equally talented and show potential to be a famous and successful sport persons. Those who have this potential should try to take sports as careers while others yet should maintain different forms of sports activities to have a healthy lifestyle.

People today move to new countries more than ever before. What challenges do they experience? What strategies are there to meet challenges?
Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer 1:
Globalization, nowadays, is opening national boundaries that have never been open to a good deal of people before, and more and more people are migrating to different countries. People move to abroad for better opportunity, yet they face many challenges, such as language, socialization, and job finding. In order to meet these challenges, immigrants should have linguistic competence, interpersonal skill, and so forth.
To commence with, the language barrier is one of the common difficulties the immigrants face. They cannot properly interact with the people of the host country, which in turn leads to cultural barriers. Consequently, immigrants find it hard to strike up a friendship with the native people. On the top of that, they even cannot find a suitable job for them. A case in point is my friend Rajesh, who have moved to Canada last year. He has not yet get a job that suits him. According to him, people take low wage jobs until they are fluent in the native language.
So as to meet these challenges, linguistic skill is the silver bullet of these difficulties. So, people should learn the language of the host country. Learning the language, while also adopting to, and learning about the new culture, help them to cope with the new country. A very good example here is my brother. He learnt the French language from Alliance Francaise de Dhaka before migrating to France. He is a well-paid executive in a renowned French company.
To wrap up, the growing number of people is moving to abroad due to the globalization. They encounter many problems like, language and cultural barriers, low-paid jobs, etc. Yet, language proficiency is the panacea of these issues. 
Sample Answer 2:
Presently people tend to move to new countries for modern life and living. But after reaching the destinations, they experience numerous unwanted troubles and face challenges as they lack strategic plans about what to do, or how to do. So, the desire to lead a better life vanishes and in reality, their life turns miserable.
But if they had followed some strategies, they could have a better life while living abroad. Illegal immigration is one of the concerning issues for them. But when they get caught by the law enforcers, they are punished and all their dreams are seriously damaged. Every country has some rules of immigration and the best way is to follow the rules and regulations of the state they are planning to move in. Besides, when people move into other countries, they do not investigate thoroughly about the employment or working conditions, availability of jobs etc. They also remain unaware about the existing economic situations, employment status, and their efficiency on the jobs they are applying for, and consequently they remain unemployed which compel them to lead a miserable lifestyle or living.
The issue of national security is also important to every government and they set rules accordingly to fight back with any sort of threats to the national security. When people move to new place, often they unintentionally violate the rules and appear to be a potential threat to the state. Such occurrences may even lead them to jail for uncertain terms. However, all the challenges could be solved only if the people, who are tending to move at new place, properly explore all the issues prior to the move. They need to be strategic. Most of the people get entrapped by some frauds alluring them for a better life with a small investment and they believe the traps which bring disasters in their life.
To conclude the essay, it should be kept in mind that moving to a new country is not an easy task and different influential factors dominate the entire process. So, people should be careful about the moving and the best idea is to consult with any distinguished immigration service providing agency. These agencies are specialized in immigration issues and provide professional helps. Often they also arrange for employments as well to the immigrants in a foreign country. Thereby, it is important to look before you leap in an unfamiliar environment.    


Some people think that universities should not provide so much theoretical knowledge but give more practical training throughout their courses.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
Sample Answer :
It goes without saying that theoretical knowledge goes hand in hand with practical knowledge. That is to say that one is complement of another. Accordingly, we have to foster students’ learning and integration of theoretical knowledge in practice during university studies. For that we need to pay more attention in practical knowledge in the theoretical part of the curriculum.
To start with, university’s key objective is to teach how to extract knowledge and how to produce new knowledge. One and only tool for this is theoretical knowledge. Because theory answers the question of why. Theory unfolds us why a technique works while another fail. It can lead a student to a deeper understanding of a concept through seeing it in the context of greater whole and understanding the why behind it. In this way, theory prepares students to set a direction for the future education and they are able to produce new knowledge.
On the other hand, practical training helps students to obtain the particular technique that become the tools of their daily business. It is much related to day to day trade. Indeed, there are some things that can be only learned through doing and experiencing. Practical training can lead students to a clear understanding of a concept through the act of doing and experiencing.
However, both theoretical knowledge and practical training are crucial for students. They will not survive unless they can bring concrete result and to do that they need practical knowledge. Whereas, practical training helps students how to solve a particular problem, theoretical knowledge helps them apply what they learned solving one problem to different problems.
At this juncture I want to conclude by saying that knowledge has worthless if there is no use of it. The significance of practical training is no less than theoretical knowledge. The primary goal of education should be to prepare students how to produce knowledge and how to use it further. So we should pay emphasize on practical training to support theoretical studies in tertiary level, as the practical training can encourage students’ learning and linking theory with practice.

Nowadays doctors can become very rich. Maybe they should not focus on profitable activities such as plastic surgery or looking after rich parents and concentrate more on patients’ health, no matter how rich they are?
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
Nowadays, physicians can become stinking rich. They are diverting from the norms of their profession. The physicians tend to focus on the lucrative activities for instance, plastic surgery or taking care of the affluent patients only. I subscribe the statement that they ought to accentuate more the sick person’s health beyond his financial condition.
For a start, in many a country, owing to repay high student debt and other cost running the practice involves, physicians likely avoid less paying practices. On the contrary, they tend to involve in profitable medical practices such as plastic surgery. To cap it all, the doctors are interested in the patients who can afford the high cost. Consequently, the poor population are being deprived of getting treatment, which in turn causes many tragic deaths.
But, the doctors, like any other noble profession, should have certain moral responsibilities towards the patients, regardless of their economic status. A doctor should recognize the responsibility to involve in the activities contributing to the well-being of the society and the improvement of public health. Physicians can mean the distinction between life and death. That is to say, in certain circumstances, patients’ life and death depend on the doctors. To give an illustration of what I mean, let’s imaging a poor man is wounded severely by an accident. The man needs a doctor to attend to him immediately because delaying treatment may simply mean death.
In pithy, the physicians perform humanitarian task in the society. They should treat sick people, irrespective of their economic status. To that end, the state should also have a conducive policy so that the doctors can perform their duty ideally.

The rapid pace of development is damaging our environment. Some people say the answer is for all of us to lead a simpler life, but others say that technology can help solve our environmental problems. What do you think?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
The rapid pace of development is damaging our environment. Some people say the answer is for all of us to lead a simpler life, but others say that technology can help solve our environmental problems. What do you think?
The rapid pace of development is clearly taking a toll on environment constantly. Many people seem to believe that leading a simpler life can help to current environmental issues, while others contend that environmental problems can be solved by sophisticated technology. However, I am of the opinion that we have no option but devising advanced technology to fight the problem.
Of course, if we decrease our developmental level to that of stone age and in the process influenced mortality epidemically, life-expectancy to be halved, and all the horrors we frequently suffered back then to return, then, yes, this would be the silver bullet to the problem, but that would be a remedy much worse than the disease. That is to say that although simpler life is conducive to solve today’s environmental problems, the reality does not permit us to lead that simple life.
To the contrary, a much better solution is to maintain or improve our current standard of lifestyle, while using advanced technology to keep environment healthy. For example, a very simple oven for cooking can substantially reduce the amount of wood needed for cooking. However, the fossil fuels are responsible for global warming to the great extent. If we can improve the present technologies such as, solar, recycle, geothermal technology etc. then we will be able to replace fossil fuels with alternative eco-friendly sources. Consequently, it is seen that advanced technologies will be our ultimate saviour which can fix ecological problems effectively and efficiently.
Almost every day is presented new technologies being proposed to fix old problems. As a matter of fact, technology is our best hope that it will avert harm to environment. It would be unrealistic to urge people to adjust a simple lifestyle.

Directors and managers of organizations are often older people. Some people say that it is better for younger people to be leaders. 
To what extend do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
It is a common scene that older people occupy directors and managers of organization. View differs considerably when it comes to the point of whether or not older people should be leader of organization. Some people contend that leader should always be senior of a corporation. On the contrary, others assert that young people would take the role of directors and managers in a better way than older would do. While both ages have the qualities of being leader, I think it depends on the nature and function of particular organization and sometimes age is not concerned issue.
To start with, older people are ideally appropriate for the key positions in those organizations where experience is the chief concern, for example legal farms or accounting houses. The reason is older people are usually more skilled in communicating with clients, monitoring project, and most importantly, advising professional advice. On the other hand, young people need to be apprentice of mentor for several years in order to accomplish adequate practical knowledge to deal real problems. That is to say that experience comes with age and this is crucial for any leader. Moreover, older people usually have more authority which is required to lead or manage subordinates. Furthermore, a sense of responsibility is another signature trait for leader which is found in older people and often lacking in the young executives. These are the overall reasons why older people should be selected for leadership.
On the flip side, young executives are more suitable for some industries like information technology, since creative ideas and innovations are the main ingredients of company growth. This is because young people are usually more up-to-date and they are in close touch with the modern world and, therefore, they naturally have a flair for digital technology. Take Steve Jobs of Apple for example. He has innovated cutting-edge products of information technology. Actually, young executives are often more dynamic and forward thinking, for that they are more open to new ideas compared to their old counterparts. In addition, today’s business usually undergoes rapid changes. This fact suggests us that we need leaders who can devise new ways of doing things constantly. In this instance, we have no choice but young executives.
From what has been discussed above it is obvious that age alone is not a criterion of selection, though age and experience may reduce the chances of risks. If the young executives have all that traits a leader should have, then age is merely a number. That is to say that age does not matter as long as they have the efficacy to lead an organization.

Some people say that the government should not put money on building theatres and sports stadiums. They should spend more money on medical care and education.

Do you agree or disagree?

You should write at least 250 words.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Model Answer:
Budget priority of every government, in all ages, is a highly debated issue around the world. Whether the government ought to allocate less in the erecting of playhouses and sport stadiums for better funding of medical care and education is a relative subject. That is to say it depends on particular country and its priority. With regard to third world countries, where the construction of theatres and stadium is a highly ambitious program and I firmly believe that it would be better to sacrifice these comparatively less important facilities for medical care and education since they are vital to the survival and sustainable development of the citizens.
To commence with, hundreds of thousand people in poor countries live in squalid conditions of hunger, disease, and unemployment. These people cannot bear the expense of medical care and education. However, ill-health and disease are considered as barriers to economic growth in developing countries. Sound health always boosts labour productivity and income, and so mitigates pauperism. Again, when poor people perceive that their children are more likely to survive and be healthy, they are prone to have smaller families that augment per capita income. Similarly, education is the single best in healthy, prosperous, and equitable societies. Education is something more than reading and writing. It is one of key investments a country can make in its citizens and its tomorrow, and is critical to bringing down poverty and disparity.
On the other hand, sacrificing the budget allocation for theatre and stadium for more important investments does not mean that no money should be allotted on these sectors. It is still justifiable to invest in them with regard to people’s recreation. However, since these investments are not as fundamental as health and education, the financing should not be prioritised.
In conclusion, health and education are the basic building block of every welfare state. Therefore, governments should allot more budgets to medical care and education rather than art and sport.

Many people spend a lot of money on clothes, haircuts, and beauty products to enhance their appearance. Some people think that it is a good way to spend money, while others think that there is a better way to spend it. 
Discuss both views and give your opinion.
You should write at least 250 words.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Model Answer:
In this pompous society, most people have a serious concern about their appearance and how to get attention by others. That is why they tend to spend more and more money on cloths, jewelries, haircut, and several beauty products. However, some people contend that there are other better ways to spend money. Since both points have merit, I feel we need a sense of good judgment, that is, where to draw line.
To start with, appearance manifests elegance, attitude, and personality. Accordingly, when someone is well groomed it can cause people to respect him more. He easily gets attraction by others. Besides, appearance is a nice tool to express ourselves. We can put forth the kind of person that we are, we are not, what we like or what we do not. Take a job seeker for example. He has to be well dressed to make a positive impression about him. Another point is that it helps to accelerate confidence. Candidate with good appearance are more forward than others. As appearance has become one of crucial yardstick of a person, people tend to spend a significant amount of money on attires, haircuts, and toiletries to make their appearance more attractive. At the first blush, it seems people are spendthrift, but if we think deeply, it is important like other necessary things.
On the flip side, there are other better ways of spending money like savings, investing, and charity. Saving is always a nice way to use money, because it is not only helpful in need, but also we can meet our expensive desire like buying car or apartment. Another good way is to invest money in share market from which can get a good profit. People can also spend money on charity. Billions of people around the globe live in squalid conditions of hunger, disease, and desperation. So, it would be great help for them.
To sum up, appearance is a daily way to express what we are and what we want to be. So we cannot ignore it. However, excessive obsessing about appearance is not sensible, just like any other kind of obsession. All that we need is to draw a boundary indicate how far we can go.

Beside a lot of advantages, some people believe that the Internet creates many problems.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer:
With the development of technology, man already has stepped into the era which no era could have dreamed ever before. The canonical symbol of this epoch is internet playing a tremendous role in our society. Some people believe that its drawbacks outweigh benefits, yet others hold opposite opinion. Personally, I believe that internet is a double-edge sword with both advantage and disadvantage.
Without any slightest doubt, as one of the greatest inventions since the beginning of history, internet caters plenty of benefit to human civilization. First of all, the most magical advantage of the internet is the unprecedented way of communication. With new services pouring in, communication is becoming cheaper, faster, and more efficient with every passing day. People now are able to communicate with others in the blink of an eye which was a far-fetched dream not too long ago.
Secondly, another major utility of internet is easy access of information. Any kind of information, any topic belong to the globe is available on internet. One can easily access to these information with help of several search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, Bing and so on. Thirdly, internet has made our life comfortable that it puts forth the whole world at our doorsteps. Internet has made it possible that one does not need to wait for hours in the queues to do the banking transactions, pay bill and tax, and buy tickets or book hotels etc. all of these can be quite easily done from home with the help of online services. Besides these, internet offers a huge jobs, business opportunities as there are many communities, forums, and services in this regard.
Beside the advantage, internet also has some limitations. Firstly, internet causes a great threat to people’s personal data. As people use online banking and other services, there remains a great risk of credit card number or account details being stolen. Hacking and spywares are responsible for many credit card frauds which have become a common occurrence nowadays. Secondly, internet poses another serious drawback is pornography. On internet, adult contents are easily accessible which casts negative impact on youngsters. Thirdly, another pressing problem caused by internet is that it engrosses people’s attention to the virtual world. People tend to spend hours after hours on internet that confines them to the isolated world. As a consequence, social and family ties are getting loose day by day.
To recapitulate, although internet benefits us in multitude ways, it still has some harms. To minimize it side effects, what we need is to be aware of its limitations and improve our discipline.

Nowadays traffic in major cities is worsening. What problems does it create? How can we help solve these problems as individuals?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Today traffic congestion tends to worsening in major cities. In these cities, drivers face peak hour congestion that prolongs travel time during rush hour by fifteen percent or more. Too many cars on the road simultaneously, the uniformity of work schedule, and accident are the prime causes of this pressing problem. As an individual, we can contribute to reducing the grave issue of traffic congestion.
Several factors are responsible for happening traffic jam. First of all, the basic problem with traffic jam is that there are too many cars try to use the available capacity of road simultaneously. When many cars set forth at the same time, the road eventually reaches gridlock point during rush hour. Similarly, the uniformity of work routine also exacerbates traffic gridlock. The uniformity of work schedule mean every job holder is on the road at same time that obviously induces traffic congestion. Moreover, obstructions caused by accidents can trigger traffic congestion. Most of cases, an accident can block the roadway. Consequently, vehicles are deadlocked that creates drastic traffic congestion.
However, individuals can play a fantastic role in reducing traffic jam. First of all, where possible they should use public transport rather such as buses or trains rather than using private transport like cars. That would be more efficient utilization of limited urban roads. Secondly, driving behavior has an impact on traffic gridlock. It makes everything worse. It is not the silver bullet to fix the traffic jam, but if one combine the right systems with disciplined driving, at least 20 to 30 percent mitigation in traffic congestion is possible. Lastly, if one lives closer to where he works, he can reach his workplace within few minutes by the simple form of transportation.
In conclusion, traffic congestion is a grave problem in our city life. Although several factor cause traffic gridlock, individuals can take some responsibilities themselves to mitigate this pressing problem.

Young people today have a lot of free time. In your opinion, do they use this time well or do they waste it?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Nowadays, youngsters have an ample leisure time with lot of means to spend it both wisely and foolishly. Some like to spend their spare time doing things like watching television, listening music, surfing internet, and reading novels, while other youngster engage in some part time jobs, volunteer activities, joins several clubs, and many structured extracurricular activities like art and sports. Now the question of whether or not they utilize their free time effectively is a complex issue to draw conclusion.
To begin with, many youngsters are simply couch potato that they spend hour after hour on watching television or surfing internet has tended to increase lately. They watch various entertainment channels like HBO, Star Movies, Fox movies, Discovery channel, National Geography Channel, CNN, BBC, Star Sports, ESPN, and so on. Similarly, some like to occupy their time with net surfing. A significant amount of time is spent in various online activities such as chatting, gaming, Facebooking, twitting and so forth. Some parents too want their children to stay at home because they are anxious of outdoor activities that their children may engage in antisocial activities like drug abuse, bullying, and various other crimes.
Other teenagers, however, prefer to spend their time doing outdoor activities such as, getting involve in paid jobs, and several extracurricular activities such as photography, drama, sports, scouts and Guides, etc. Some spend their free time productively and involve in various paid jobs in order to earn their own pocket money. Again, others have predilection for volunteer activities like social welfare, clean environment, and wildlife and so on. Through these activities, they can hone their interpersonal skills. Similarly, many join several sporting clubs such as rugby, football, cricket, etc. they also prefer arts like drama, photography, drawing and painting, and so forth.
To recapitulate, young people spend their leisure time in two basically ways: indoor and outdoor activities. Both activities are useful to some extent for them. So, I think youngsters spend their time somehow productively.

In some countries young people have little leisure time and are under a lot of pressure to work hard in their studies.
What do you think are the causes of this? What solutions can you suggest?
You should write at least 250 words.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Model Answer:
Leisure time, in common parlance, is the time when one is not working, and one can relax and do things that he enjoys. But it seems that many students find themselves with very little free time and they are laden with homework and many other forms of studies. Attitude towards education and competitive educational system are two major reasons contributing to this situation. However, leisure time is very crucial for overall growth, and therefore, we have to fix the problem with suitable solution.
First of all, one of main reasons is our attitude towards education. In many societies, education is so worshiped that not getting good grades often means distracted from your destiny and, thereby, failing your own and family’s expectation. Parents usually exert pressure on their children to spend more hours each day studying at home after their usual day at school is over. The result of this is that their leisure time is shrunk and they feel a considerable pressure on them. Secondly, a pressure cooker education system that originates stress from a highly competitive and rigid atmosphere in which grades are priority. The implicit rule is simple: you are how well you do in exams. Consequently, parents provide children with tuition teachers to give them an extra push. In addition to school, children are attended tuition classes several days a week, where supplementary homework is dished out. So, students have to study all day even after school to cope with the system. As a result of the fact, young people hardly get opportunity to spend their leisure time.
To solve the problem, both the education system and the attitude need to be changed. The education system ought to be a system that underscores more on intelligence of youngsters and their mental growth rather than the grade. It should be an ideal system that students could easily maintain their study without having pressure. Similarly, parents are needed to be aware of the consequence of the pressure they put on their children. They have to understand that too much pressure on the study can drive towards anxiety, stress, and depression that may cause serious mental disorders. So, parents should discard this mindset and make a leeway for children to explore and develop personal interests.
To wrap up, the problematic mindset is percolated not only by educators or parents but by society as well. Therefore, it is the society which needs to take a step forward to solve the problem.

Write about the following topic:
Is ambition a positive or negative characteristic? Is it necessary for success?
What is your point of view on this topic?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer 1:
Ambition is nothing but a strong desire for accomplishing a goal through hard work and determination. The great achievers of history have all had it. Individuals with this trait loom large as people who consistently drive towards their dreams and goals. So, there is not a shadow of doubt that ambition is a positive trait which is essential to be successful.
To begin with, I negate the notion that ambition is a negative characteristic. Let me clarify it. Ambition does not constitute a character flaw which causes dishonesty or unquenchable thirst for outcomes beyond stretch goal. Instead, ambition is an aspiration for attaining something good where nothing existed before.
Again, I firmly believe that ambition is the key to success whereas success can be defined as embracing a goal. However, road to success is always wrought with ups and downs: pain, uncertainty, and brutish hard work. In this context, one need a great effort in order to be successful in attaining his goal and therefore he need to be persistent and highly motivated with the goal. It goes without saying that it is absurd to have such motivation and determination without being ambitious. That is to say that ambition creates zeal within human that fuels motivation and instigates the aspiration to succeed. In addition, ambition leads to dedication which fosters perseverance. Perseverance is a trait that helps people to firm their commitment to their goal. More or less, each of us has some goals, but only who has the ability to stick with his goal can taste the success. Thus, ambition plays the crucial role in achieving goals.
To wrap up, success is a phenomenon that all of us wish to attain and, success and ambition go with hand in hand. This suggests that ambition can never be a negative trait. In achieving goal, ambition and success are not divergent, but interconnected in such a way that one can be explored through other.
Model Answer 2:
Ambition refers to the high and unrealistic motivation or urge to achieve something. It could be defined in the phenomenon of ‘’how does needy become greedy’’ as ambition leads toward greed. I strongly believed that there is a high correlation between need, ambition, selfish ambition and greed.
Ambition is a negative characteristic as it demands unrealistic goals and leads towards daydreaming. Only will and determination could be defined as a positive characteristic for achieving goals. Ambition distorts the human thinking, and leads towards the purely unrealistic world, the person becomes greedy for materialism, expect unrealistic assumptions in interpersonal relationships or becomes rigid for having fame. The materialistic ambition may motivate the person to work hard beyond his capacity, as a result, he may lose his actual level of performance, he stop working with daydreaming and wait for a miracle to happen. Unrealistic ambitions in interpersonal relationships like, high approval, respect, love, and care made the ambitious person socially isolated as they expect another person show intimacy without give and take phenomenon, this high level of unrealistic ambition distort the person thinking within two extremes either ‘good or bad’’. If any person care and love him, he was labilized good otherwise he will be considered bad. They become so rigid as to give the benefit of doubt to their love ones.  It exploits the ambitious person, if his demands couldn’t be fulfilled, which leads towards, isolation, anxiety, depression and other psychological disorders. Ambition for fame reveal the complexes of a person, which could be only cured by that person.
I strongly believed that ambition distort the contact from reality and cause many biological, psychological and social problems.

Write about the following topic:
Many university students live with their families while others need to live away from home because their universities are in different cities.
What are the advantages and disadvantages in both situations?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
In this modern and competitive world, quality education is the silver bullet to be successful. Everybody tends to get admission into a university so that he can acquire a better degree. The flagship universities are often located far from the cities where large numbers of students live. Accordingly, many of the students have no option but live away from their families in order to obtain a quality university degree. Yet others who live in the same city of the university can stay with their family. In this essay, I will discuss the both aspect of the situation: advantage and disadvantage.
Staying with family has a lot of advantages while studying in university. Students can enjoy home comfort and get full support from their family and relatives. They can lead a disciplined life with the help of their parents. They have no worry to cook: mother knows very how her child likes his meals. They have free food, free rent, and free laundry. It is their place, so they can do whatever they want to. They can keep watching their favourite television programs. After all, they can take all the advantages of their familiar environment.
However, there are plenty of benefits staying away from home. First of all, students can attain many imperative qualities. For example, one can learn how to deal with a complex situation independently and maturely. In addition, it also helps them to firm their confidence to encounter the world full of challenges and obstacles. Secondly, these students can make a big group in the library or canteen in order to finish next week’s assignment, when students who stay at home are snoozing on the long bus ride back to their home. Moreover, it also is a great opportunity to accomplish interpersonal skills. Last but not least, it imparts the chance to be acquainted with others’ cultures, principles, and dogma. It helps them to smash their stereotypes.
In conclusion, I would like to say that university is just not a place to get a piece of paper. It is the very place where student would grow academically and personally. Therefore, students should stay at dormitory of university so that they can take full advantage of it.

Write about the following topic:
Nowadays, international tourism is the biggest industry in the world. Unfortunately, international tourism creates tension rather than understanding between people from different cultures.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
You should write at least 250 words.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Model Answer:
The world we live in is a global village. People in different regions are able to reach their destination within a day, even the other side of the globe without difficulty. This does not mean that relationship between nations is getting close together. Unfortunately, international tourism fails to achieve concord with nations to a great extent which might lead to mayhem.
To begin with, cultural clashes can occur due to the differences in languages, lifestyles and values, cultures, ethnic and religious groups, and levels of prosperity. Comprehend a culture is a matter of long time and most of the cases tourists have limited time to know about the culture of host country. Veiling of women is a good example here. In Islamic countries, women strictly maintain veil in order to respect their values and religion. Sometimes this leads to tension when a tourist mistakenly acts contrary to this norm. Tourists’ behavior and customs may cause hostility due they have little knowledge about the communicating pattern of the local people. For example, Bengali people are very friendly and have a warm relationship with foreigner and they expect that tourists act as they behave. This kind of difference causes harm on harmony and creates annoyance to local people. In addition, difference between languages might translate into misunderstanding.  Moreover, religious groups may violently react when sacred sites and objects are not be respected as they are perceived as goods to trade.
From what has been discussed above it can be said that international tourism creates tension rather than celebration for many differences. Personally, I believe that knowing adequate information about the host country and open minded attitude can create a friendly atmosphere and enhance international understanding. Finally, some pigeonholes have to be smashed in order to build mutual communication.

Write about the following topic:
In many places, foreign visitors are charged more than locals when they visit cultural or tourist attractions.
Do you agree or disagree with this?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Some tourist attractions in many places have a policy of charging tourists a massive rate higher than locals. Opinions differ considerably when it comes to the issue that the foreign visitors should be overcharged or not. However, I am of the honest opinion that it is fair to charge international tourists higher prices. Indeed, foreign visitors cannot be treated as locals for several reasons.
First of all, these places obviously are very few and they really are worth the elevated rate of admission. If there is a low supply and a high demand, the price will high according to law of supply and demand. In the free market economy, it is quite usual that if foreign visitors are willing to pay a premium, then they should. Why would a business ever charge lower when the vast majority of people would pay higher.
Secondly, indeed, locals should have some privileges over tourists because it is their homeland. They own these places. It is their prerogative to pay less than tourists. You cannot blame them when they take advantages from their own objects.
Thirdly, tied to the previous argument, in many developing countries there is a reality that local peoples would not be able to enjoy their own monuments and parks if the price were set too high. Again, these attractive sites are needed a high maintenance cost. So, it is quite logical to charge premium from foreign visitors. My point is that in countries where the income gap between guests and host is huge, then asking international visitors to pay more to subsidize the system is not an unfair game.
To recapitulate, there prevails reality to demand more from tourists. I think dual price system is completely logical. Instead of showing separate price system in ads of these places, it should mention a discount for local people is my suggestion so that it does seem a sneaky way to fleece foreigners.

Write about the following topic:
Some people say cheap air travel is good because it enables ordinary people to travel, while others argue that it is bad for the environment.
Discuss both views, and include your opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Air travel has become a common preference among most of the people in this globe due to cheap cost. Every year, approximately 1,423,500,000 people travels by plane and 3,900,000 passengers travel by flight every day. However, the cheap air fare could have disastrous effects on environment. In the essay, I will place my opinion after discussing both the advantages and drawbacks of this reasonable air fare.
As a result of robust advancement of aviation, this industry is constantly expanding by providing affordable cost for all class of passengers. Accordingly, this affordable airfare influences the common people to travel by airplane and obviously they take the advantage of it. This means that a lot of people can confluent all over the world. This interaction enhances peace and harmony which lead to calm international tension. In addition, visitors from other countries increase tax revenues which help to prompt the GDP of the host country. A case in point is Macau; the earning from tourism sector contributes to its GDP approximately 46-47 percent. Another point is that beyond the GDP contribution that the tourists bring, this also creates a huge employment opportunity. Furthermore, affordable cost gives the opportunity to common people that they now take a break from their busy life and take a tour for relaxation which once reserved only to upper class people.
However, airplanes are one of the major sources of greenhouse gas emission that threats environment drastically. Aircraft consumes a huge amount of fossil fuels and dumps massive amounts of pollutants into the atmosphere. This shows that the more air travel means the more global warming.  And global warming causes heat waves, acid rain, draught, blizzards, and so forth. Thus, air travel brings a huge damage that keeps the planet under threat.
All in all, I would like to say that cheap plane fare is playing a fantastic role, while it pollutes atmosphere. So, we have to look for alternative source of energy in order to take the full advantage of the economy cost of flight.

Some say that economic development is the solution to poverty: others say it is the cause of poverty.
What is your opinion?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
The so called economic development is an illusion. In spite of overwhelm economic progress billions of people around the world live in a squalid confinement of hunger, disease, and insecurity. This pandemic poverty puts forth the globe’s most venomous and fatal scourge. But the privileged minority is trying to subtly diddle by exalting economic growth. In today’s capitalist system, the political and corporate elites at the helm of the world economy are tailoring economy according to their interest. Consequently, on the one hand, wealth is being accumulated to the few people and on the other hand a large number of people are losing everything they have. Therefore, I am of the honest opinion that economic development does not necessarily mitigate poverty, and may, in fact, exacerbate.
We live in a world which is driven by capitalism that carries the seed of poverty. To clarify, capitalism is nothing but a vicious process in which capitalists hire labours and raw materials in order to produce commodity for selling. The price of the commodity is comprised of net value, value of labour power and surplus value. The difference between the net value of commodities and the value of labour power is surplus value which is eked out by the labours. The value of lobour power is the cost of maintaining and reproducing the worker and his family at a socially accepted living standard. Most of the cases, this includes only the bare necessity. That means labours are fed only the amount that he can again sell his labour for the next day.
In addition, capitalism is inherently an expanding system in which capitalists have to constantly accumulate and extend their capital in order to preserve it. They are bound to extend their capital otherwise they would be destroyed by their competitors. In the process, this expansion eventually takes place on a worldwide basis, because capitalists have to push their mode of production into every nook and cranny of the world. Nonetheless, capitalists also have an insatiable thirst for enjoying the consumption of their capital. Thus, labours are being exploited to earn surplus value which is again reconverted into capital; actually it is a gyration. In this gyration, a huge development takes place all over the world both infrastructure and workforce, but these are enjoyed by only few claimants of capital. Let us take situation in the USA for example. The lion’s share of wealth in U.S is possessed by 400 rich families, in which the six individual Wal-Mart heirs owns wealth more than 30% of Americans combined. Thus, few people make their own heaven and conjure up this as development in front of us.
From what has been discussed above it can be said that of course economic development is the prime cause of poverty. That is to say that economic development is the offspring of capitalism that is a process by which few people become rich to make the rest poor.

Write about the following topic:
Theoretical subjects such as mathematics, philosophy and economics should be removed from university curricula and replaced with practical subjects such as computer programming and engineering.
Do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
The question of whether or not theoretical courses like mathematics, philosophy and economics should strike off from university syllabus and replace with practical subjects such as computer programming and engineering has always been a massive debate. However, when it comes to the issue of knowledge, there are several types of knowledge and several ways of acquiring each type. In general, there are two types of knowledge; one is theory and the other one is the practical application of theory. Both kinds of knowledge are crucial and both make us better at whatever we do. In this context, I do not grab one aspect particularly too firmly. That is why I will look at both sides and the arguments for and against it.
To begin with, theoretical courses are designed to teach us the why. They are conducive to comprehend why one technique works where another fails. It shows us the whole kingdom of knowledge and helps us set strategy. Theoretical courses lead us to a deeper apprehending of a concept through seeing it in the backdrop of a greater whole and understanding the why behind it. However, university should not be the mere training center for corporate business. Of course, the university should provide the course that can be applied in solving real world problem. But, this does not mean that the university’s sole responsibility is to supply executives for corporations.
On the other hand, practical subject aids us to learn the particular techniques that become the tools of our trade.  It deals with our day-to-day work. These are something we can acquire through doing and experiencing. Practical subjects help us to understand a concept clearly through the act of doing and personal experience. There is not a shade of doubt that everybody has to engage in jobs in order to earn bread and in that case practical knowledge is utterly important. Therefore, university should offer practical subject related to job field at least to some extent.
All in all, I would like to say that both of the above are significant for us. We cannot survive in any career unless we can bring result and to do so we need practical knowledge. Again, learning how to solve a particular problem only teaches us how to solve that problem again. Practice can only make us efficient in dealing the problem. Whereas, theory helps us apply what we learnt solving one problem to different problem. So, what we need is a perfect combination of theoretical and practical courses.

Write about the following topic:
In many countries, foreign labor is an important part of the economy. Using migrant labor can contribute to the development of a country, but it can also cause economic problems.
What are some of the advantages and drawbacks of expatriate labor for a country’s economy?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Foreign workers, in many countries like Malaysia, UAE, Singapore, and even the USA, contribute to the development to a great extent.  While expatriate labours have certain advantage, they can also turn into burden for the economy of the country. In this essay, I will focus on both side of the coin: advantage and disadvantage.
Foreign workers impart many benefits to the host country. First of all, they meet the scarcity of certain job field. Take Malaysia for example. It is bereft of skilled worker at building construction. Therefore, expatriate workers are blessing for Malaysia due to the fact that Malaysian people have not got high skill of building construction. Secondly, foreign workers are usually cheap. They are generally satisfied with the wages which are high in comparison to their home country. Moreover, foreign workers are likely to do many odd jobs which local people are reluctant to do. Last but not the least, when a country is lacked of professional worker, government of the country imports professional workers from another country to work at the country to share their expertise with local people. For instance, every year Malaysian government hires professional workers to be employed in particular sectors like education, medical, construction, and many more. All these advantages manifest that the economy is benefited in manifold ways.
On the flip side, migrant workers also pull back the economy. One vital factor is that they send an ample of money home, instead of spending it. This leads to the loss of foreign exchange for the host country. In addition, foreign workers not only take jobs away from the local, but also reduce the wages for some jobs. For example, local people prefer a job with high salary. In many cases, foreign labours want to do the same job in comparatively low salaries. Consequently, employers can get workers with less salary. In this way, expatriate workers contribute to reducing salaries and lead to unemployment problem. The influx of migrant workers leads to overpopulation. Overpopulation means pressure on services such as housing or hospitals and this is an extra burden for the state which has to pay the cost. These facts can evolve economica crisis for the state.
To wrap up, in my opinion, all that I want to say that there must need some control over the use of migrant workers so that they cannot cut off the labour market for locals. The country ought to emphasize on the citizen before leaning outside for workers.

As the world becomes technologically advanced, computers are replacing more and more jobs.
Describe some job positions that may be lost because of computers, and discuss at least one problem that may result.
You should write at least 250 words.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Model Answer:
With the advancement of technology, computer has declared a new era of production. The modes of production are different from those of the industrial era as those of the industrial epoch were different from the agriculture. A revolutionary change has taken place with the combination of computer and the automated self-regulating machine. The outcome of this change is a system of almost unlimited productive capacity which needs progressively less human labour. Consequently, many job positions are dying out every day in almost every workplace.
We have already entered the world where computerization causes jobs to wash away. In many manufacturing factory, a sizeable chunk of human labour has been digitized by computer. At times, when labour caries goods to transfer from one place to another in a factory. But now automated vehicles are being replaced the job of these workers. The comparative vantage of human labour over computerized system is drying up before our eyes. For example, Forbes now uses the algorithms to generate earnings announcements around a company’s stock price, and even can tailor the information to provide to particular audiences. Consequently, many journalists have been quitted from Forbes.
Although an ample number of tasks are being done efficiently and effectively rather than human effort, still there have some limitations. The automated vehicles are incapable to make ethical decisions in the same manner as human. For example, how does the automated vehicle choose comparatively less harm in the event of an accident?
To sum up, I believe that humans are intelligent enough to invent new trend in business. The more computers extinct jobs, the more new positions will be created, I think. Human being will have to prove that nothing can match his superiority.

Some people think that it is important to have a single language as an international official language. Others think that it will make it difficult to identify countries and cause a loss of culture.
What are your opinions on this?
You should write at least 250 words.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Model Answer:
As globalization blurs the boundaries among countries, some people argue that it would be crucial to have a universal language in terms of commerce and relation. Conversely, others believe that it will wash away different identities and contribute to cultural erosion. However, I firmly believe that one global language cannot replace other languages for some reasons.
First of all, language is more than a communicating tool. It reflects the culture in which it remains. A language has gone through a long process of emerging and becoming sophisticated. It absorbs particular tradition, history, knowledge, and way of thinking during its journey. Each and every unique ingredient of a language enriches human race as a whole.  If the languages are replaced by one single language, it would be great harm to our civilization. Many rich cultures, traditions, and knowledge would be easily dried up. Moreover, language and identity go with hand in hand. No one wants to lose his identity because identity is an inextricable part of his very existence. Therefore, a universal language is as impractical and unwelcome as extinction of identity.
Secondly, a single world language will certainly flourish an elite class with native speakers, who will take the chance of their vantage position to think and work quickly in their mother-tongue. In this context, they might manipulate it to their advantage that can lead to discrimination to a great extent. In addition, they will rule over those who have another language as their mother-tongue. Ultimately, one single language means one superior nation who has prerogative to govern the other nations.
In a nutshell, different languages are of crucial for their culture and for the development of their native speakers. The more language we have, the world would be more interesting and more alive.

In some countries young people are forced to work in different sectors and have little leisure time and are usually under a lot of pressure to work hard in their work place.
What do you think are the causes of this? What solutions can you suggest?
Give reasons for your answer and give any relevant example or experience you might have to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Many countries, particularly developing countries, are the hotbed of child labour where the youngsters have mere time resulting in work hard in their studies. Several reasons lie in the fact including poverty and unemployment, limited access to education, violation of laws, and even globalization. However, every problem has a remedy in this world and child labour is not an exception in this regard. To combat this problem, we need to address the causes first and then work on to eradicate the causes.
First and foremost cause is poverty and unemployment. In many cases, the poor children and their families are bound to rely on child labour in order to meet their basic needs. In a statistics, United Nations has revealed that one-fourth of the world’s population live in extreme poverty. The intensified poverty in Asia, Africa and Latin America induces many children there to surrender to child labour.
Secondly, many children in developing countries have limited access to compulsory and free education. Most of the developing countries, the government is corrupted and is inefficient to provide children with free education. In 2005, there are approximately seventy five million children who are not in school. Besides, drop out from school is very familiar scenario in many poor countries.
Thirdly, the government of developing countries, in many cases, is helpless to impose laws or codes of conduct. Everyone acknowledges that child lobour is curse but most families confine to very limited choice. That is to say, they know not putting a child to work means there will not be enough food on the table for everybody. In addition, many manufactures have predilection for child labour due their cheap labour. As a result, the government cannot enforce laws even they want to.
Last but not the least, globalization is also a good contributor to this case. Many multi-national companies employ children directly lobour-intensive low-skill jobs. MNCs may employ children, since they are an excellent source of cheap, unskilled, and not-demanding lobour. MNCs also employ children in indirect ways. It takes place when they purchase from local manufactures goods and services produced by children. For instance, brand name companies like Wal-Mart and Disney buy their clothing from Bangladesh which employ and many times exploit children through appalling working conditions, long working hours and extremely low wages.

Write about the following topic:
Many newspapers and magazines feature stories about the private lives of famous people. We know what they eat, where they buy their clothes and who they love. We also often see pictures of them in private situations.
Is it appropriate for a magazine or newspaper to give this kind of private information about people?
Give reasons for your answer and give any relevant example or experience you might have to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:

The incessant need of the public to know what a famous figure is doing is phenomenal. In this case, media provides them with their private life such as where they shop, who they love, and even what they eat. But when it come to the issue that where to mark the boundary between what should and should not to be published about the famous people’s private life does ignite a debate is a conundrum that has proved almost impossible to find a solution to the contentment of either complainants or editors. However, after discussing the both side, I will bring out my position.
Paparazzi tend to collect every single detail about famous people, particularly celebrities. Every day we see their faces and stories that are mostly scandals. Most of the cases, we are delighted with these stories, but ironically do not know how far the paparazzi go in order to get those stories and do not consider impact on the victim. Certainly, these affect them mentally and physically. For example, Angelina Jolie bathing her children in a privacy of her home in Prague who became so upset the violation that started to crying, shouting and shaking when she saw a shade of a paparazzi got close enough to take picture of this intimate moment. Similarly, we can recall the horrific night of Princess Dian when she and her boyfriend was trying to avert taking picture of them by paparazzi. The only option they were left is to hit a high speed limit that resulted in a terrible car crash on which they died that night in Paris.
However, newspapers are expected to provide latest information happening around the world includes politics, business, sports or showbiz. As I above said that people has enormous curiosity about celebrities even their private life, media is bound to response to them. We should bear in mind that what media is doing is fulfilling the demand of masses and it is quite natural for media like any business organization.
On the other hand, we live in the era of freedom of speech where media is tending to supply us up-to-date information happening around the world includes politics, business, sports, showbiz and so on and equally the world acknowledges human rights that everybody is entitled to consider his private life, health, correspondence comprising digital communication. However, we should always keep in mind that media is nothing but an agency providing and exploiting our hunger for knowledge. If public demands scandalous affairs, paparazzi will fetch it to them. Many concede that celebrities are somewhat public property and also there is a load of celebrity who desperately wants to be exposed.
To wrap up, I am of the position that we need a delicate balance so that celebrity can be able to protect their rights to privacy and at the same time the freedom of expression can be prevailed. For this matter, what we need a sense of proportion that editors ought to concede that unless they have enough reason that they are serving the public’s sensible interest about celebrities, then the intrusion cannot be justified. They should be free, yet they should be responsible.

Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children.
Do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:

Today’s computer has become an integral part of our everyday life. It has already changed our children’s life as well. While this is an amazing technology to enjoy and to use in learning it has also unseen effects on our children. However, the question is one of hot topics at the moment and there is huge difference in opinion as to whether computer can have more negative than positive impacts on our children. In this instance, I am of the opinion that its demerits outweigh its advantages.
Sedentary children with too much computer time may experience developmental and neurological delays and some of which can turn into permanent. Moreover, many children suffer from increased heart and breathing rates, and overloaded sensory system, which may translate to stress and perhaps more serious diseases and disorders over time. According to ‘KidsHealth’, another physical compliant among computer users, as a result of overuse of wrist, is carpal tunnel syndrome.
Similarly, behavioral issues are also a great concern. Children need to acquire interpersonal skill and that is not really possible with the, often anonymous, structure of online interaction. Becoming dependent on computer your children can hide their real-life problem they might experience. In addition, children who are used to learning at computer speed very often struggle to pay attention in the classroom.
Children who often play computer games that are based on violence and war themes might develop a negative mentality. These games are often accused to affect these kids’ psychology and violent activities among children can be a cause of their addition of computer games.
Children who spend too much time on computer and electronic gadgets become less social. They spend almost zero hours on outdoor activities and as a result obesity has become common among this technophile generation.
To sum up, in this computer era, no one can think a single day without computer. Therefore, in order to avoid above mentioned drawbacks, we need to guide our children so that they can use computer correctly and effectively.

In today’s competitive world, many families find it necessary for both parents to go out to work. While some say the children in these families benefit from the additional income, others feel they lack support because of their parents’ absence.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Model Answer:
In this competitive world, many parents are bound to go out for work. While some people argue that children of these parents benefit from this extra income, others contend that they lack support as a result of their parents’ absence due to their busy working life. Today’s financial condition pushes both parents engage in jobs in order to ensure proper maintenance their children. I am of the opinion that it is hard for both parents to avoid job and so they have to find a way to keep a good balance between work and family life in order to control drawbacks of this situation.
Having both parents work outside the home can cater various problems. Firstly, the most fundamental need of a child is love and care. While both parents are busy with their own job responsibilities, children might feel destitute which may translate into severe psychological imbalance. Moreover, in many cases, parents fail to harmonize their family and work life together. This has a direct impact on children’s life. When parents can spend less time with their kids because of their work pressure, it would decrease interaction and that ultimately harms family bondage. Furthermore, parents are the model for their children. They can learn good morals from their parents. In this case, working parents cannot always be able to serve this purpose. Therefore, the children of working parents often lack values.
However, I contend that parents can ensure their children a cozy life, if both the parents work. They can afford to send their children to a better school, a better health care service for their children, and so forth. Children of the working parents may get whatever they want to. They can be enrolled in extra curriculum activities like after school programs. Job holder parents can provide children with expensive clothes, toys and many learning materials which satisfy these children greatly. In my case, as my parents are both working, I need to do all the things myself such as making my meal or washing my own cloths. This situation makes me self-dependent and at same time I learn time management and can enjoy my freedom. I also learn that work is a crucial part of life.
To recapitulate, both parents have no option but doing job in order to bring prosperity for their children. In this context, what parents need is to acknowledge that kids mental and emotional needs are equally worthy as their material needs in order to insure a bright tomorrow for them.

Write about the following topic:
Some people say that advertising encourages us to buy things that we really do not need. Others say that advertisements tell us about new products that may improve our lives.
Which viewpoint do you agree with?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer :
View differs when it comes to the impact of advertising. Some people contend that advertising provokes to buy unnecessary things. On the contrary, others assert that it provides us with information of products that furnish our lifestyle. While both statements have their merit, it may be applied under different circumstances. In my opinion, advertising is conducive in improving our lives.
To begin with, advertising often tend to misguide people. Most of the cases, they stress only on advantages and hide the demerits. Not only they use partial information, but equally use famous celebrities in order to manipulate people’s buying decision. For example, famous celebrity randomly is used in cigarette or alcoholic products and many fans who are influenced by the celebrity are easily biased from these ads. These products are not only unnecessary for them, but they are also detrimental for their health. Again, products in ads are presented in a exaggerate way that consumers are craving for them. According to a 2007 study by American Kaiser Family Foundation, half of all advertising time on children’s television is devoted to food advertising. None of this time comprises advertisements for healthy foods. The Kaiser Family study found that food advertisements make extensive use of taste appeal to sell products, and simultaneously they also associate the products with fun like the appeal of contests. In addition, many ads emphasize on health benefits to be obtained from their products. It often highlights that the products comprise essential nutrients which has no factual evidence and thus people are deceived from this advertising.
Many, however, contend that advertising plays a fantastic role in terms of giving useful information about the products. Advertising provides us with useful information which helps us judging different products available in the market. In my case, I always collect information about products to compare their feature and price before purchasing. Moreover, many a times, advertising is very useful tool for introducing new products. For instance, cellphone manufacturers cater information about their new products with unique features and knowing the information, consumers decide which products suit best for their need. In addition, advertising also informs us about various offers that some particular products announce which helps to make plan for weekly shopping. Furthermore, normally in advertising, manufactures focus the best feature of their product which influences other manufactures to have better product in order to compete. In that case, competitors tend to offer a quality product in a comparatively reasonable price. Thus, consumers can get the best product with a cheaper price which ultimately develops their overall lifestyle.
To wrap up, advertising has both positive and negative sides as every other thing has. So, it is the responsibility of the consumers not to be induced by the attractive ads and they should be sensible while taking buying decision that which one is appropriate for them and which one is not.

Present a written argument or case to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic:
In some countries, marriages are arranged by the parents but in other cases, people choose their own marriage partner.
Discuss both systems.
You should write at least 250 words.
Use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and with relevant evidence.
Model Answer:
Marriage is the core institution of human societies. Societies evolve mode and method for choosing of spouse, in conformity with their peculiar socio-economic, religious, and political conditions and according to their level of cultural advancement. This shows the differences in the attitude of societies towards marriage. Some believe that parents should decide who their children marry with, while others hold that individuals should be free to select their wed. The essay will be dealt with these two views.
In an arranged marriage, two persons tie the nuptial knot only with the consent of their parents and the blessing of their relatives. Married couple could resort to their parents or relatives at the time of problems like maladjustment or misbehave. Moreover, when the marriage proves to be a failure, they have a number of people around them to seek support. Their parents would come forward to solve the problems between the couple and most of the cases they are able to solve their problems. This is the cause why, arranged marriage is deemed secure in many societies.
However, in many societies, people want to select their partner and they believe that the right to choose their wed is one of basic rights they ought to have. In this case, two people tie the wedding knot generally after falling in love with each other or after knowing each other for a long time. They get plenty of time to explore both the bad and good traits of each other, long before their marriage. This understanding is very conducive in the adjustment after marriage. There is a less chance in arising complexities.
To sum up, different societies have different norms and customs depending on their own values. Whether parents take the decision or people make their own, I think the key to successful marriage is love, trust, mutual respect, care, and commitment.

Write about the following topic:
In many countries today, the eating habits and lifestyle of children are different from those of previous generations. Some people say this has had a negative effect on their health.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Changes and differences are common trends in human history. However, children, in many countries, have changed their food habit and way of life compare to previous generation. The item they eat and the way they lead their life are detrimental for both their physical and mental health. I am of the opinion that we have to acknowledge the alarming phenomena right now and take necessary steps to lessen negative impacts as much as possible.
Nowadays, children tend to eat unhygienic foods like fast food, package cookies, pancakes, frozen meals, colas and sodas, ketchup, cereals and so forth. These junk foods are appealing to children due to they do not always understand the consequence of their eating habits. This eating habits cause many complications such as obesity, chronic illness, low self-esteem and even depression. It also affects their school performance and extracurricular activities as well.
Again, ‘lifestyle & addiction’ to modern technology is another problematic change. Children are now busy with computer games, internet surfing, and other online activities.  Many times, they are reluctant to engage in outdoor activities and even they prefer virtual friends over real friend. It has two way impacts on them: physical and mental. It develops eye problems, backache and many other diseases. On the other hand, it also makes hindrance in acquiring interpersonal skills. Children with too much computer time become isolated from rest of the world. This makes them self-centred and they are bereft of several social values. Thus, they become physically and mentally weak.
To recapitulate, when children practice bad habits early in life, they incline to eat that way throughout their life, or tend to reverse those habits later on. On the other hand, teach them the proper lifelong habits in the early, they will have the tools they need for a lifetime of healthy eating habits and ideal lifestyle.

Write about the following topic:
Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live?
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
With the development of technology, people can prepare food easily and quickly with the help of advanced cooking appliances and this is a great relief in this fast-pace lifestyle. People now use kitchen appliances like pressure cooker, rice cooker, and microwave cooker in order to prepare meals quickly and conveniently. There is no doubt that this change is a blessing which improves our life to a great extent.
First of all, the change has perfectly been matched with our busy life. Our life has become much more busier than ever before and eventually, time is very much crucial for us. The change not only makes food preparing easy, but equally makes it faster than we could before. With the use of microwave cooker, food can be prepared conveniently at the blink of an eye. In my case, I am engaged in two jobs and time is crucial no doubt. At times, preparing meal was a great concern for me. But, now, with the help of modern kitchen aid tools, I can prepare my meal easily in a few minutes which has reduced my stresses of making food and this makes me able to invest time in some recreational activities. In addition, I can store food in refrigerator that I don’t need to go shop every day to hunt for food. So my personal experience evidences that this change improves our life.
Similarly, people can cook food with less effort compared to the past. Cooking aids like grinders, roasters, and electric choppers not only reduce work load, but also make things to happen with less physical effort. No doubt, housewives are now more relaxed and they can share more times with family members or spend time in their developmental activities. For example, in Asian society, most housewives used to spend a considerable time in kitchen. But this change saves their time and extra effort, and they now can invest time in some financial activities so that they can be self-reliant. Thus, this change contributes to women empowerment implicitly.
To wrap up, throughout the history, human goes through various changes in order to make life easy and comfort. Once, man hunted for food, but now man can prepare food instead of spending several hours or of physical effort. Things have become almost automated in cooking. Therefore, it can certainly be said that the change is a silver bullet in our busy life.

It is becoming more and more difficult to escape the influence of the media on our lives.
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of living in a media rich society.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.

Model Answer:
It goes without saying that media has become an indispensable of our life. We are surrounded by it, from the programs we watch on TV, the songs listen to on the radio, to the newspaper and magazine we read every day. With the advancement of technology, the media has a myriad of access into our life that it pervades every aspect of modern life. However, it is a double-edged sword that has both pros and cons.
To begin with, media conveys and forms opinion on politics, economics, business, culture, and so on. Media plays a fantastic role in forming people opinion in a national issue. In a democratic country, media is considered to be a vital institution, since it reflects mass’ opinion which is very conducive in making policy. Media resonates the freedom of expression and freedom of speech within a state. In addition, media aware people in various social issues like dowry system, women empowerment, violence against woman and so forth. Finally, the most significant and primary objective of media is to entertain people. So, it is seemed that media is prevalent in every avenue of life that we could not think a single day without it. For example, my days are started with the morning news on the television and concluded with the late night news. That is to say that every step that we take is require the help of media.
Although we have been experienced numerous benefits of media, still we cannot ignore its dark sides. On a careful observation, media influences not only the way we act, but equally the way we think. Consequently, it can practice the power to hike a useless, unwanted issue and completely conceal a burning matter. By doing so, media often create an artificial crisis which leads to a chaotic situation. Moreover, very often, it manipulates people opinion and promotes the views of people who are in power in a way that there seems to be the only possible opinion left in front of the society.
In conclusion, we have already embraced the era of information. Now, it is impossible to avoid the media completely. So, what we need is the skill in interpretation with the intention of not to be misguided by the media.

Governments should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
It is hard to think a single day without energy in this industrial era. Energy is the main key to sustainable development. However, in almost every case, we are using fossil fuels like oil, coal, and natural gas. Consequently, we are in a risky position regarding energy security and greenhouse gas emission. Therefore, every government should look for alternative sources of energy in order to ensure energy security and environmentally friendly planet.
Every day, fossil fuels meet the increasing demand of energy used in industries, agriculture, households, producing electricity, and so on. But the fact is that these sources of energy are limited. In addition, it is expected that world population will be double by 2050 which indicates that the energy consumption will increase in times than now by this twenty-first century. It can be easily predicted that increasing consumption of energy will soon deplete the natural sources of energy. So, governments around the world have to acknowledge the concern of decreasing fossil fuels and should explore alternative sources of energy.
Again, global warming is caused by primarily the burning of fossil fuels that emit CO2, methane and other greenhouse gases into the environment. Global warming is having a considerable impact on the planet right now in a multitude of ways. We can experience this happening in real times in many places around the world. Ice is melting in mountain glaciers and both the polar ice caps. The American Climate Central reveals that extreme weather for instance drought, acid rain, heat waves, rainstorms and blizzards will continue to occur more frequently and with greater intensity as the result of global warming. In addition, the more ice melt means the more sea level rise. In 2014, according to the World Meteorological Organization, the sea level rise accelerated .12 inches per year on average worldwide. The rate of increase is expected to accelerate in the coming years. It shows that if the current trends continue, many coastal areas, where roughly half of the world population lives, will be flooded. Moreover, global warming has a profound and widespread effect on ecosystem. Many species are already moving north due to the warming temperature. It indicates that many species may not be able to survive in the new climate regime and may go extinct.
In conclusion, all that I want to say that every government has to devise alternative resources of energy. This is because we cannot use these fossil fuels forever and also these are severely detrimental for our planet. So government around the world should encourage the alternative sources of energy which do not deplete our natural resources or harm our atmosphere.

The internet has dramatically altered our lives over the past few decades. Although some of these changes have been negative the overall effect of this technology has been positive.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Give reasons for your answer and give any relevant example or experience you might have to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Internet is the latest in the series of technological breakthroughs that everyone’s life, over the past few decades, on the earth has been being shaped by the global network directly or indirectly. Yet, it has sparked a heated debate as to whether this trend is positive or negative. In this instance, I am of the honest opinion that the overall impact of the technology is obviously very good though it has still some bad sides as everything has.
Internet has declared a new dawn in communication and information technology. First and foremost thing is that it helps us to keep in touch with friends and family, colleagues, and relatives from anywhere in the world. People around the world not only can talk face to face by just a click, but equally can follow their activities through some social networks like, Google Plus, Facebook, and so forth. To add with this, nowadays, in many cases, the patients who live in remote or backward places can get prescription with the help of this wonderful tool. Next, this is an amazing tool for education. Internet is the huge ocean of knowledge of mankind from ancient to modern epoch. We can learn everything which we want to know with the computer connected to the internet. For instance, it is crucial for every research that is literature reviews and any researcher can get hundreds of thousands books, journals, PhD and M. Phil dissertations, research reports, research articles, and so on with the use of a search engine like Google. Finally, internet has changed the way we live and work which no epoch of human history has suspected. A case in point is online banking, which is often easier and quicker for people that they can carry out their transactions over the web to anyone in the world without the hassle of writing cheques. We can also keep abreast of our bank details more quickly and sufficiently with the supporting of this marvelous tool.
Conversely, every coin has two flip sides and internet is not an exception. The first significant drawback is that it rivals people’s real world. Some people spend too much time on internet and forgo real life connection. Although it may be easier to keep in touch with the people we know, but it has erased the incentive to meet people in person. The worst case is that people has chosen to isolate themselves from their family. Rather, they like to spend hour after hour surfing the net in search of anything to get them escape from reality. Some people even maintain secret love affair which develops perfidious with their spouse.
To recapitulate, with the help of internet, we are going where no human has gone before. It makes our lives better in every aspect in multitude ways. Therefore, no one can avoid this magical tool whether at present or tomorrow. Of course, it may induce few bad things happen. But, like any other tool, to make the internet useful for us requires a good sense of judgment, I think.

Write about the following topic:
Individual greed and selfishness has been the basis of the modern society. Some people think that we must return to the older and more traditional values of respect for the family and the local community in order to build a better world to live in.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and give any relevant example or experience you might have to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Modernity has lost its moral compass with society plagued by avarice and egoism. In modern society, everything is judged by the money and owing things. The more you have, the more successful you are. Consequently, people are racing with each other in which there is no place for common interest. This modern attitude of self-interest has ruined the traditional, shared values and left people feeling a deep sense of despair. That is why, I agree with the given view that we must retrace the golden times when we valued traditions and respected the family and community so that we can build a happier world and a happier tomorrow.
We live in a world where selfishness and excessive desire is pervaded everywhere. Everybody is competing with each other in order to please himself with material acquisitions and possessions. There is nothing wrong with acquiring wealth enough but there is always a pressure on people to go for more and more and as a result we have no time for family and friends. Each and everybody is busy in his own thirst for more. So, both the individual and the society are being affected by this greedy psychic pattern. For example, since the parents cannot spend quality time with their children due to their busy life, children are very often deprived from love and affection of their parents. As a result, they cannot learn ethics properly from their parents that results in anti-social behavior, violence, binge-drinking, bullying, and so on. To add to it, when greed and individualism becomes the cornerstone of the society, it contributes to the growing gulf between the rich and poor.
In contrast, life in the past was simpler and happier. Everybody love and respected each other. The elder is respected by the younger and the younger is loved by the elder. Not only the older members of the family but also members of the community looked after the children and their advice was valued. Marriage was deemed as the core institution of the society that the divorce somewhat unknown to them. In addition, society was seemed like a big family that everybody knows each. Everyone shared each other weal and woe. They lived for each other that sharpened man’s feelings of sympathy, and so bred notions of obligation and consideration. Thus, the values of respect for family and society glued everybody that led a happy life.
To recapitulate, living in this society of consumer culture, we are all being succumbing to the greed that is fueling conflict, inequality, and poverty. From what has been discussed above it can be said easily that the traditional value-based society can be the best remedy for this suffocating world and make a heaven like world to live in. since we cannot return from the computer-based automated world to the manual world but we can definitely revert to these traditional values to try to create a new society which has both material wealth and prosperity, and respect for the family and community as well.

For some people shopping is not just about buying what is necessary, but a form of entertainment. Do you think it is a positive or a negative development? 
Give reasons for your answer and give any relevant example or experience you might have to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Shopping has become an indispensable part of our everyday life. It is a necessity and at the same time shopping puts forth joy and pleasure. Some people really think of it as an entertainment act and they get lot of fun from it. Despite of its drawback, shopping as a form of entertainment has positive impact on both the individual and the overall economy.
Too much of anything is very bad whether it is shopping or else. Shopping might be reduced into the pocket of addiction. Many a times, people buy things which are simply unnecessary for them. But they do shop just they love to shop that is a kind of addiction. As a result they become spendthrift and they lose their control of expenditure which may bring misfortune. A friend of mine named Jackson is a good example to be set forth. He shops every second month to change his laptop and in this way he downgrades his average financial position which has somehow developed perfidious relationship with his parents.
However, with the influence of consumer culture, people’s attitude and lifestyle has changed dramatically over the last decades. They want to lead a cozy life at any cost. Consequently, they visit shopping malls very frequently. Moreover, shopping is not merely shopping anymore, because it has transformed into a form of amusement. Many developers are discarding the traditional shopping malls’ notions and replacing the outstanding structures with outdoor venues that resemble the downtown areas with lots of shopping and a dose of entertainment conflated in. you can enjoy movie in Cineplex,  can dine, watch fashion show as well as do a little shopping. Consequently, the current trend of shopping is one of the best ways to escape from a tedium and hectic life. In my case, whenever I feel bored or lonely, I like to go to shopping in order to rejuvenate me.
Furthermore, it helps to keep the wheel of economics moving on that is the signature of individual’s progression and country’s development as well. Thus, this vogue of shopping as an entertainment can be seemed as a boon not only to individual equally to the nation.
From what has been discussed above I can draw the conclusion that we have already embrace the consumer culture and no one can avoid this culture. Like any habit, to make the shopping habit useful for us requires the exercise of good sense is all we need.

Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child’s development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.
Discuss advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.

Model Answer:
Education plays a vital role in everyone’s life particularly children. However, the question of whether learning at home or at school is better has sparked a heated debate. Whereas indoor education offers better protection with individual learning and opportunities for families to bond, schools have student with a wide range of abilities and from a variety of social backgrounds, a superior range of materials, teachers, conducive learning environment and so on. Although, both the views have their own merits, I am of the honest opinion that school is the best place for a child when it is about overall development.
First and foremost, learning at home offers a great deal of freedom, particularly educational freedom. While the basics are certainly covered, students have flexibility of they especially learn and when. Students can emphasize on the subject matter that gets them excited, whether that is math, physics, history or creative writing. Next, a great deal of physical freed is ensured for the children who learn at home. That is to say that, families have much more freedom to vacation at odd times because of not having any strict schedule of school hours and kids can spend a quality time with their parents which is a great opportunity to learn many values from them. Additionally, kids have emotional freedom. Students very often undergo troubles with bullies, fellow student pressure, monotony, and competition. In the home environment, these factors are absent. Children are able to think, dress and act the way they want. Last but not the least, since kids who lean at home can spend much more time; they can form significantly closure family relationships.
However, school has so many vantage points for ensuring development of a child. Firstly, attending school gives the child to meet new children with a wide range of ability and from a variety of social backgrounds. Some get close only to become good friends for many years or even lifetime, while some remain only classmates. Conversely, if the children learn at home, they will likely not able to many such kids. Meeting new children and socializing also stretches their horizon of knowledge. Consequently, if we want to make our children sociable, it is best to attend school; home they might end up leading only a solitary life. To add with, schools also teach how to cope with bullies, gossip, peer pressure and competition. Again, school is no more the place which only deals with academic purposes. School has become the first stepping ground of a child, wherein he can learn lot more rather than merely rote learning. Learning basic etiquette, developing hobbies, refining them, getting skilled at multitasking are some of the many things that a school provides a child with. Similarly, school has teachers who are trained in particular subject so that children can get better lesson results in clear concept about the particular subject. What is more, school supplies children with physical resources for example, library books, sport equipment, exercise equipment, and musical instruments.
From what has been discussed above it can be easily said that children are better off in a school ambience. Yet, spending time with family and individual learning are crucial, the wide range of expertise and resources that school belongs to cannot be found in the home. At school, sometimes children may experience some troubling social situation, but so too does the real world, children must learn to master these on their own.

Some people believe that money is the most important factor for achieving happiness. However, others believe that happiness has nothing to do with money. 
Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Money is the most crucial matter in everyday life. To lead a comfortable life it is important to have money to pay for our food, house, education, and so on. It seems that many can bring everything we want, even happiness. But the connection between money and happiness is always one of the most delicate, most interesting, and most sensitive issues that has sparked a heated debate. Money can bring everything, yet nothing can be brought by it.
Money is the second god in this material world that you are endowed with everything by it. People who have enough money they may feel happier since they have no worry to be hungry, their children will go sophisticated schools, their diseases can be cured, they can maintain a cozy lifestyle without having tension about cash and their lives will be easy going. This seems simple equation. But things are not simple that reality says different things. In practical, rich people are always chasing for money and eventually they confine to an insatiable thrust for money. Consequently, they always keep themselves busy in making money resulting in scarcity of time.  They can give their children whatever they like, but they cannot spend a happy moment together with their family due to their busy schedule. Receiving gifts, the child may be happy, but at the same time, he still misses his beloved father. Money can buy many things, but the happiness from it is relative. Money will buy you a beautiful bungalow, nice bed, delicious food, and latest model car. What money will not buy you is sleep, authentic recreation, taste of food and so forth.
However, happiness is something different, something that comes from within you. It is a mental state of feeling content, fortunate and luck. Many things, in this world, can make you happy cost nothing. Friends and family, love affairs are all priceless. A very good example here is love. Love is one of those free objects in our lives that costs nothing but simply brings boundless happiness for us. I have been in a relationship for a year now and it has been the best experience of happiness that I have ever had. I would not trade the happiness for all the money in the world. Conversely, we eat together at restaurant, watch movies, and go for long drive for that need money. That is to say the time we spend together has cost. In this instance, money is not the condition of love but just makes things easy to happen. However, all that I want to contend that is happiness is the spontaneous overflow of powerful emotions. Without happiness in life, everything turns into worthless whether it is money or something else is more valuable than money.
To conclude, in today’s materialistic world we have need money to survive. But what we need to keep in mind that is we have many other important things to be achieved in accordance with money. To lead a happy life, one should combine the main things in one single life.

Some people think women should be allowed to join the army, the navy and the air force just like men.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and give any relevant example or experience you might have to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
With the development of liberal sphere, we have come a giant step closer for women to become full citizens in every sense of word. Now, women are joining in armed forces which are previously occupied men alone. View differs considerably when it comes to the issue that whether or not women ought to be permitted to be part of the defense forces as like men. Some people contend that biologically women are inferior to men and certain things should be based on gender. Whereas, others oppose this notion since it is the obvious violation of women’s fundamental rights. However, in some ways I agree with the idea that some professions deserve a particular gender, but in others I must take the opposite stance.
The proponents who do not want to allow women to take part in military believe that certain things not made for women and the military is not an exception in this regard. They find, this job for women, not only difficult, but equally challenging in terms of physical condition since women are biologically disqualified. This seems like that men cannot have babies. That is to say society will survive if certain things are prerogative of certain gender.
However, historical and empirical facts witness different evidences. There, historically, were a host of valiant legendary women soldiers who changed the face of military. A case in point is Opha M. Johnson who demonstrates the example that how exceptionally a woman could perform on the battle ground. However, nowadays, women are involved in almost every profession and are excelling furiously like no time in the history. Accordingly, they should not be dissuaded in army only because of their physical inferiority. Since, with the huge development of military technology, we have light military hardware than ever before which is easily compatible with women. Finally, we have to maintain the democratic norm and women should be free to select whatever career path they wish for. That is to say that we need to create a conductive environment in which women are the ultimate authority of their own.
All in all, I want to say that it would be unwarranted if we make women deprived of entering the military career in this age of liberty, of information, and of technology. I have been convinced that our nation would be served best if women go hand in hand with men in this particular arena.

Psychologists have known for many years that colour can affect how people feel. For this reason, attention should be given to colour schemes decorating places as offices and hospitals.
How true is this statement? How far colour influence people health and capacity to work?
Discuss advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and give any relevant example or experience you might have to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
It goes without saying that everyone has a favorite colour. When it comes to colour predilection, there are as many opinions as there are hue variations. Whether it is the dresses we wear, the room we live, or the car we drive, we are all confine to certain colour and take our preference seriously. So, naturally, psychologists have a long-standing curiosity in colour. They have discovered there is a correlation between colour and human mood. That is why, we pay attention to colour schemes gracing places as offices and hospitals in order to create a conducive ambiance for work and health.
There are several reasons why colours are able to induce how we feel. “We react on multiple levels of association with colours; there are social or cultural levels as well as personal relationship with particular colour”; according to Leslie Harrington, executive director of The Color Association of The United States, which forecasts colour trends. She also contends that we also have innate reaction to color. So, choosing one colour than other colours is very important. This means that a particular colour has a particular role to play. For example, green puts you in a relaxed or refreshed mood, purple makes you feel powerful or reveal your creativity, red evokes powerful emotions like passion, fear and anger and blue takes you down, but not down to depression level rather it conveys tranquility.
However, we should be aware of the impact colour has on employees while decorating offices. It seems that if the workplace is decorated with too colours, employees may end up finding it hard to concentrate on their work. Yet, choosing colour depends on the type of business being conducted in the office. For instance, purple is appropriate for a designer who wants creativity. Since it stimulates his spirit and ego, and makes him more optimistic. In contrast, when it is dealt with something physical, then red is the perfect choice, because it stimulates physically. Similarly, hospitals have long been aware of few colours like mint greens and light blues are conducive in decreasing patient stress and can impart physical and mental relaxation.
All in all, I want to say that while a person’s personality affects how they determine colour, colours mold everyone universally. It, thus, is an inevitable fact that colours may somehow influence how we feel, especially in certain places like office and hospitals. So, keep it in your mind that which colour is suitable for hospital or office environment when decorating these places.

Write about the following topic:
Convenience Foods will become increasingly prevalent and eventually replace traditional foods and traditional methods of food preparation?
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
Give reasons for your answer and give any relevant example or experience you might have to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
It is assumed, following the veers today in our society, that the convenience foods will become prevalent more and more, and eventually wipe out the traditional foods and conventional cooking method. From the word convenient, the foods are being prepared for the people’s convenience. That is to say less time for the people to wait for their food and more time for them work. However, I am of the opinion that this assumption cannot be realized into reality.
First and foremost reason is the concern about health. Most convenience foods contain little to no nutrition value and have excessive amount of saturated fats, sodium, and sugar. While everybody ought to avoid these foods, it is highly recommended for those with the health conditions like diabetes, heart disease or hypertension these type of foods altogether. In addition, convenience foods are also loaded with preservatives, added flavoring, unnatural coloring, and other unhygienic substances. If consumed on a regular basis, such foods can quickly begin to attack the person’s health, which can contribute to serious health issues, for instance obesity, heart diseases, strokes, and cancers.
Another obvious reason why traditional foods or traditional cooking method would survive is that cooking and eating traditional foods is an indispensable part of our heritage. Take Chinese dumplings for example. Dumplings are the Chinese classical food and the traditional dish eaten on Spring Festival Eve wishing a good luck for the coming year. Not only do the dishes themselves matter, but also the preparation and the ways of serving and eating mean a lot. Therefore, it goes without saying that dumplings and the ways to make them will be inherited by the following Chinese generation. Moreover the longer time we spend on preparing meal for our family, the stronger affection we manifest for our beloved akin.
In my opinion, we should still need the foods that are prepared traditionally since this will ensure us of nutritious and hygienic foods. Convenience foods may be good option to partake when we are saving time or unable to cook food. But it will take its toll on us in the long run due to that it is a fact that this type of foods are bereft of natural and unique quality of traditional foods. So, to live a healthy and hygienic life, we must begin with a hygienic meal and a healthy habit.

It is important to ensure that children with a wide range of abilities and from a variety of social backgrounds mix with each other at school.
To what extend do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and give any relevant example or experience you might have to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Our society thrives on diversity. Our culture needs people with various kinds of proficiency, ability, interest, and personality. In this case, school is the best place mingling with students with mixed abilities and backgrounds prepares the children as a responsible member of society. Therefore, at school, the assurance of children with a wide range of capabilities and from a various milieus is very crucial, I think.
At times, school meant just learning the historical events, reciting poems and sonnets, solving tough mathematical problems or learning Newton’s Law. Nowadays, school has transformed into the first step stone of children, wherein they learn a lot more than just rote learning. Developing social skills, developing competitive attitude are two of the many things that a school equips a child with. However, children spend more or less six to eight hours a day at school and so it should be like another mini society where children can interact with children with a wide range of abilities and of different social backgrounds. If the school makes sure the children with various calibers, it provides them with twofold benefits.
On the one hand, they will compete with each other and the other hand they can also learn from their peers. Similarly, school ought to admit students from several social mountings. Children from different backgrounds subscribe different beliefs or norms. They judge same thing from different perspectives. Sometimes, there may have some disputes, animosity or hostility. It is when teacher can teach them how to act at some social situation, such as how to honor others’ opinion despite of difference or how to cooperate each other to avoid such unexpected affairs.
From what has been discussed above it is clearly seen that the school, with children with a range of abilities and from different social backgrounds, can impart overall development to children. The composition not only serves the academic purpose, but equally helps them to be a good human being. Thus, it is a good idea to give opportunity to merge with other as it makes them more amiable, broad-minded and knowledgeable.

Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
Give reasons for your answer and give any relevant example or experience you might have to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Todays, more than ever, our children grow up in a world saturated with the mass media. Most frequently, the media depict a world of celebrities in which unhealthy behaviours such as drug addiction, smoking and drinking heavily, and illicit sex affairs are exalted. Moreover, celebrities are everywhere in the mass media and used to sell almost every product out there. Certainly there are some role models for youngsters among today’s celebrities to emulate; there are also many who provide a decidedly negative influence.  Teens who try to follow these celebrities may fall victim to several negative matters.
To begin with, celebrities, generally, can earn much of money and public know who they are. For instance, you are famous cricket player, what makes up you to be renowned? It is your hard work, your perseverance, and your effort. Celebrities manifest their abilities to shine in our life. By having a role model in their lives, teens, thus, can sketch their path and follow their model to success in life. Moreover, celebrities are always the stimulating character for children. It is not so hard to collect celebrities’ information, no matter their images, their activities or their personal life have been circulated in the media. Youngsters can learn from their favourite celebrities’ experience that the way they deal with life under any situation.
However, most of the children have access to several media, and are susceptible to what they view. They are ductile to different messages in the media due to their brains are still developing. It seems that those who spend more time on media are more likely to interpret the real world in ways that echo the recurrent messages in the media. It appears like every day there are more and more glamorous exposures on the media of illicit activities of celebrities. Children see their favourite celebrities doing drugs or drinking alcohol, and partying, they think they should too. This conveys the message in order to be cool or to have fun you have to need these substances. At this point, I want to share my own experience that is I was started smoking with the influence of Al Pacino watching his movie Scarface. It is seemed like normal to me. So, this is how children may begin to think that it is not a big deal, and this can induce serious problems leading to and including alcohol or drug addiction and even several risk- taking behaviours.
After analyzing the both points of view, in my opinion, I lean on the fact that media coverage of celebrities is capable enough of making children in negative side. In this instance, as parents or mentors, we have to be aware of what we allow our children to see and listen to. In addition, the media ought to play positive role to build a sensible nation, because today’s child is tomorrow’s citizen. Furthermore, celebrities need to change their bad habits and should realize that they need to be more concerned with themselves, particularly with their portrayal in the media.

Write about the following topic:
In some countries the average worker is obliged to retire at the age of 55, while in others people can work until they are 65 or 70. Until what age do you think people should be encouraged to remain in paid employment?
Give reasons for your answers.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
Compulsory retirement age differs society to society in terms of socioeconomic condition. But now the issue of increasing retirement age has sparked a heated debate. Retirement at 55 can be as easily fitted as that at 70. I am of the honest opinion that it is the high time for re-fixing retirement age which is better for both the individual and the nation.
Age is the prime concern in deciding retirement, whereas, many a times age is proven that it is not the main yardstick of ability. In many cases, some 65 or 70 years old workers may not work efficiently as they work before, while many workers at this age are sound enough to work as well or better than they used to. The suitability of a position should be based on workers’ performance rather than their age. What the employers need to do is to observe their workers performance. Those who are performing poorly may be asked to retire, but those are yet able to do work efficiently should go on. The organization can be benefited in ways; on the one hand it can have an experience worker and the other hand it can save money and time on training new employee.
Similarly, since the life expectancy has increased around the world, it makes good sense to increase the retirement age. The overall lifespan has stretched shows that now people are able to work for a longer period than before. This means that people are now able to contribute more to society and they have also need income for longer period. At this point, the mandatory retirement at 55 cannot be justified. It violates human rights and puts nation in financial crises as well. What I am arguing is that if the state prevents a citizen from working towards their own ends, then it is hindering their constitutional rights to liberty, life and happiness. The state cannot defend forcing a person into inactivity for the rest of their life. The citizen should be allowed to continue for as long as they wish in whatever they choose to do, and hope any liberal man will agree with me by the time it becomes an issue. In other words, it also turns into a burden of social security system.
To sum it all up, I would like to say that age is not a crucial factor for retirement of people. Since the average lifespan has increase, it would be wise to rise retirement age that has two fold impact on both the individual and the community as well.

Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
In contemporary societies, there is a dramatic shift that celebrities are famous not for their achievements, but for glamour and wealth results in bad impact on youngsters argued by some people. I completely agree with the notion. Since glamour and wealth is what produces a pleasurable pang of desire; that is the feeling of “if only I could”. Almost every case, young people succumb to the glamour and wealth, and dream of if only I could belong to that group, drive those cars, wear posh dresses, and so on.
It goes without saying that celebrity is an unavoidable phenomenon in the mediated world. Whether active pursuit or even active evasion, it is unimaginable to evade celebrities and their actions through their frequency and quantity, which permeate all aspects of everyday life. Social media, films, magazines, radio and television all manifest celebrities in society influencing vogue, how we put on cloth, and even the food and drink we consume. Society, it seems, is stuck with the celebrities, attaching excessive value to the public figures whose achievements may be limited, but whose visibility is extensive. A case in point is pop singer Victoria Beckham, who is renowned for her style of dress, expensive cars, and lavish lifestyle. Which can have negative impacts on teenagers due to they try to emulate her superficial pompous, glamorous appearance. My point is here is that there is a seductive power in glamour and wealth what really is not a style or a personal quality but a phenomenon that reveals our inner lives and shapes our decisions, small and large. Consequently, youngsters are fostered many a times dangerous illusions.
From the above discussion it is obvious that the combination of glamour and wealth has a great influence on decision making about where to live, what to buy, which career to pursue, and so on. The young people, due to the lack of experience, are misled by those celebrities who are famous largely for their gorgeous appearance.

Televised talent shows have become popular in many societies today. Are these shows a good method of finding talented people, or are they just entertainment?

Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
In many contemporary societies, televised talent shows have become very popular over the past decade with shows such as “American Idol”, “The Apprentice”, “Survivor”, and “Big Brother” attracting big audiences. However, it is a well establish notion that every man is born with a unique innate talent. So there is no shade of doubt that among the seven billion men living in the globe has at least one talent of them are unique trait. Most of the cases, it is very difficult for them to parade the world what they are capable of doing. Talent show, indeed, is a wonderful platform for them to manifest their talent. In this instance, many people think that these shows are an excellent approach for hunting the veiled talents, while others oppose the view and claim that it is nothing but amusement. In the following discussion I will show both the points have some merits.
The mode of television programs have changed significantly with the rapid development of mass media over the last decade. Accordingly, TV talent shows have playing their role in changing the face of popular television. These shows simultaneously entertain a great extent of its audience and hunt real talent from the ordinary people. Talent shows have become a golden platform for common people to show their hidden talent, turn their dreams into reality, and ultimately, help them change from ‘ordinary’ to ‘conspicuous figure’. On these programs, anyone can participate, no matter who they are or where they have come from. Viewers of these shows acknowledge the contestants as very ‘ordinary’, and what is more, it is the proof of real success which is not confined to ‘special people’. Not everybody will make it big, but some do, and they are likely to be the boy or girl next door.
However, the opponent of talent show claim that these shows are mere an entertainment, no business with searching real talent. They point at the procedure through which a talent is selected or nominated is problematic. Let it be clarified, viewers are told to vote for their favorites instead best performer. What does favorite mean to the lay people? Their decision can vary from whoever they like best or sorry for favorite pro. The critics argue that if these shows claim themselves as talent shows then why not encourage viewers to vote for the singer or dancer, performance they thought was the best of that episode? Similarly, many opponents of televised talent shows, including the legend Elton John, contend that a show like X Factor is the wrong way to debut a career in music. Although there would always be the artist who would set forth to the top by means of a lucky fluke, but for the most part, success can be attained through a long, dedicated struggle. Consequently, most of the cases, the winners of these shows are faded away from the audiences’ memory immediately besides one or two exceptions.
In conclusion, all that I want to say that these programs are striving to be popularity shows rather than talents shows. To me, these shows are just the hollow performance of meritocracy that casually commodifies the performers engaged, treating them as two dimensional actors in an extended marketing practice. At the one hand it inspires to consume masquerading, and the other hand aspires to succeed. It replaces honest ambition and striving with an unhealthy focus on our own special want within a consumeristic fabric of instantaneous satisfaction.

Nowadays it is easy to apply for and be given a credit card. However, some people experience problems when they are not be able to pay their debts back.
In your opinion, do the advantages of credit cards outweigh the disadvantages?
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
Nowadays, human beings enjoy the freedom that no epoch of human history can imagine. Man can get what he wants; that is, he is now able to purchase commodities or services without making immediate payment just through a credit card. Yet what remain beyond the pleasure regarding such free purchasing approach are a multitude of troubles evolving from bad debts.
It goes without saying that credit card is a friend in need. This means that credit card offers people access to money and the facility to settle up later which is very useful in case of emergency. Moreover it helps people to maintain their quality lifestyle in a convenient way. Many a times, people want to obtain various commodities like tablets, smartphones, ornaments, exquisite meals, and even traveling packages which are beyond their immediate paying ability as they receive monthly salaries. In that case, credit card makes it possible to have those commodities what they long for without instant payment in cash. Instead, it gives people opportunity to spread the payment over several months. Furthermore, having a credit card means people can make purchases abroad without having concern for local currency. With the tiny card, people can attain a cozy lifestyle.
On the flip side, behind the bright facade of credit card, many people are affected by the problems spring up from the card. People are enticed to spend money they do not really have results in debts.  Most of the cases, consumers are less aware of the exact amount of money they spend due to the payment will be made at end of the month. They just keep in mind that they can purchase without making immediate payment. They can discern the liability only when a huge transaction knocks their door. Sometimes, when an individual cannot pay his debts, he is offered to apply for another loan in order to pay previous one. Consequently, he could be easily pinned down in the labyrinth of credit circle. Similarly, the prevalence of credit card among the youngsters undermines their capabilities to supervise their finance. Compare with the previous generation, the contemporary generation is more likely to be influenced by materialism. Recent studies show that young adults aged 18-25 are less likely to conglomerate wealth but simply spend on luxury item they craving for. As a result, they become spendthrift day by day.  The vital aspect of credit card is to allow people to buy products without the need to pay immediately. This option can be easily misused by consuming unnecessary things. The young adults are, thus, susceptible to bearing bad debts.
In sum up, I would like to reiterate that credit card is an essential thing for modern life. Although it has huge benefits, it can be curse for those who are unable to manage the card meticulously. So, the question of whether it designs our life in a better form or it destroys us depends on how we master the card.

According to those in the travel business, the nature of the average ‘holiday’ is changing. Rather than seeking a relaxing break in a far-away place, people now want excitement on their holidays and are keen to participate in unusual and challenging activities.
Why this change has happened? Do you think it is a good trend?
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
Typically, holidays seem to be a relaxing pause between busy routines. But this conventional notion of holidays is changing day by day. In holidays, people tend to engage in unusual and adventurous activities rather than looking for comfort, calm or amenities. Several reasons, like competitive attitude, dangerous sports, prestige, lie in this current vogue. However, I think these changes have positive impact.
First of all, the world has become more competitive than it was before. People are always in race and do not want to tame the spirit even during their holidays. Accordingly, they have predilection for adventurous sports, such as skydiving, snowboarding, river rafting, paragliding, snowshoeing, scuba diving and so on. Besides, technology is changing the way tourists make holiday. People are being engaged in risky activities during their holidays, because technology has made it easy to take challenging activities furnishing safety measures.
In addition, tourists are propelled by the prestige of the destination or activities, which ought to be exclusive or unusual, perhaps inspire appreciation or envy in others. Moreover, people seek a unique destination or unusual activities so that they can get an exceptional, authentic experience because of having penchant for exploring new goals and wanting new experience. Furthermore, people lust for many records in order to be famous. One of my friends, Musa Ibrahim, reached the highest peak of Himalaya during his holiday trip and now he is a celebrity in the country and has earned both name and fame.
However, the implication of engaging unusual activities in the holidays is great. If the motto of the holiday is to rejuvenate life, then challenging and unusual activities are the best way to achieve it. Not only it boosts energy level, it equally makes competent to cope with our fast paced lifestyle. That is to say that these activities infuse new energy refreshing our body and mind in order to prepare us so that we can work more efficiently.
In conclusion, the new trend of holidays is associated with varying degree of risk, thrills and excitement in an exotic, unusual, and remote or wilderness destination. These activities increase the ability in adjusting an unexpected situation which every man should attain.

Some people think that in the modern society individuals are becoming more dependent on each other while others say that individuals are becoming more independent of each other.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
We live in the modern world where technological accomplishments inconceivable in previous societies are within our grip. This is an era of genetic engineering, of space travel, of internet. Human beings are enjoying the freedom which no epoch of human history has suspected. Yet never before are we dependent on what we ourselves have created. Never before have we designed by that which we have designed. The more densely populated our world become, the more our lives characterized by feelings of loneliness and isolation. Everything, in the contemporary societies, seems pregnant with its contrary.
In modern society, there is a paradox of differentiation. That is to say that in day to day practice there is on the one hand an increase in independence, yet on the other hand there is an increase in dependence can be found. The increase implies to the process in which the division of labor is consistently getting more extensive. That means existing social units are being split up into independent sectors, each emphasizing on a particular function. However, the differentiation also induces a process of increasing dependence, since individuals all become more and more dependent on each other as they intend to meet their growing needs. Everybody has his own place in the intricate arrangement of modern society, and constitute, combined with other individuals, a part which have to assist other parts so that the system can be kept going on. A good instance here is the mode of production in garments industry. There are divisions of labor, such as different parts of a shirt are made by different workers in various divisions. Everyone has his certain task in order to complete the whole work.
All in all, I want to say that everyone is independent, yet nobody is independent. In the modern, differentiated society, individual leans on his fellow men has declined, but on the other hand dependency has increased on abstract, large and anonymous systems pertaining to care, information and money.

Teenagers have problems at home and school. What difficulties are they facing now? What should parents and schools do to help them?
Give reasons for your answer and give any relevant example or experience you might have to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Adolescence is one of the crucial stages in the lifespan of human being. It is the time when very rapid changes take place both mentally and physically. Accordingly, it is quite natural that teenagers may encounter several problems like substance abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, bullying emotional problems and so forth. In this case, both the family and school have lot of things to do in aiding the youngsters.
Growing up into adulthood makes one to experience many difficulties in various sphere of life including personal, social and educational problems. One of the major problems is substance abuse. Very often teenagers are susceptible to drug addiction. Reliance on hard drugs and alcohol to cope with daily stresses reduce their responsible decision making proficiency that leads to serious adjusting problems including anti-social activities and depression. In order to avoid these problems, parents and teachers should come up with proper guidance while at the same time ensuring conductive atmosphere so that they can cope with their stresses.
Similarly, another noticeable problem they face is sexually transmitted problem. They are likely engaged in irresponsible sexual behavior which induces several sexual diseases. In this case, the youngster ought to be helped by teachers and family in discarding stereotypes about sex which throws them at higher risk. Adolescent should be rendered with proper sex education in an effective approach both at their homes and in school.
Again, widespread problem is bullying. Most of the cases, it takes place in areas which are less monitored by adults, for example in the student cafeteria, locker rooms, restrooms and on the school bus. Schools should keep these places under surveillance by using security techniques comprising close circuit camera. In addition, teacher can help to solve the problem through guidance and proper counseling. The parents can also play an important role in solving the problem. Parents should come as useful help for the growing teenagers.
In conclusion, at this period, adolescents want to be more competent and independent. They get opportunity to spend much of their time without any supervision. They need the acknowledgement of their developing maturity and since they are still children, they are needed guidance, discipline and above all protection of teachers and of parents. In order to set effective boundaries, both the parents and teacher should actively consider both sides of this balance.

Write about the following topic:
In many cities the use of video cameras in public places is being increased in order to reduce crime, but some people believe that these measures restrict our individual freedom.
Do the benefits of increased security outweigh the drawbacks?
Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
The post 9/11, the risks have increased tremendously now with the war on terror and security turns into the main concern of our society. Consequently, the practice of using surveillance cameras in public places to record public activities is ever-expanding, and will definitely expand still further after declaring war against terrorism. The cameras make many people feel more secure, knowing that bad guys are being monitored. But the proponents of the right of privacy and some citizens are frustrated with the idea that the authority is watching their every public move. Discussing the both points of view, I will give my opinion.
The surveillance cameras are used to curb the potential crimes and find out the culprits as well. In addition, facial recognition software and other technologies have made these cameras more effective and the images are more valuable to law enforcement. Police could easily identify criminals through parsing the CCTV (close-circuit television) footage after committing a crime. A very good example here is the incident of bombings at the Boston Marathon. The law enforcement agencies analyzed footages from government surveillance cameras, private security cameras, and imageries shot by bystanders on smartphones. It took the FBI only three days to bring out blurry shots of two suspects, take by a departmental store’s cameras. Moreover, CCTV systems impede potential crimes. Once the criminals realize that the place is under surveillance by a closed circuit television system, they eventually choose to go somewhere else. Every day, several heinous crimes take place around the world that these crimes leave a deep mark of fear in our collective consciousness. Consequently, many feel a strong need for surveillance camera to calm their fears.
Though this statement may be apparently intriguing, it is ultimately unpersuasive. The individual right of privacy is deeply rooted in our culture for many reasons. It defends ordinariness of life. That is, it enables us to engage in our business on a day-to-day basis without having consistently to worry that we will be judge by other now or in the future for everything we do. It frees us to make decisions and to lead our lives in ways that we believe to be right without having incessantly to justify ourselves to others who would condemn our decisions. That is to say that the right of privacy, indeed, is a crucial part of what it means to be free. Again, where the state is involved, there is a special dimension to the right of privacy. If the state could learn everything it wants about every one of us, it would be hard if not possible for citizens to keep in mind the state works for them, rather than the other way around. The right of privacy, therefore, is an essential component is preserving the citizens’ own sense of dignity and autonomy vis-à-vis the state. Any democratic state is chained in oath that the right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable interference.
All in all, I would like to contend that surveillance on individuals in public is permissible only if the footage can be accessible by the law enforcement agencies only if they obtained search warrant from a judge who has determined that the law enforcement agencies have probable cause to believe that viewing the footage may reveal useful information in a criminal investigation. This seems to me the best approach to reconcile the interest in individual liberty with the competing interest in effective law enforcement.

Write about the following topic:
It seems that many companies today are becoming much more concerned with profit than with happiness of their workers. How could companies take care of their workers in the future?
Give reasons for your answer and give any relevant example or experience you might have to support your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Typically, financiers and economists contend that the sole purpose of business is to make money, the more the better. This narrow view, deeply embedded in the capitalist system, molds the actions of most companies, constrains them only to emphasize on profit maximization and delivering returns to stakeholders. Workers are being neglected to the companies. However, the conventional notion has been started to decay that many deem that main focal point should be worker. This sounds very optimistic for workers that in future the worker will be got to priority.
It goes without saying that workers are the ones who translate companies’ vision and mission into actionable. Consequently, industrialists or business are bound to think differently in if they want to better performance from their workers and better performance means efficient and quality production ultimately proliferate  profits. So, the companies, in future, will make worker friendly plan so that they can feel that they are taken care by their employers.  First and foremost thing will be worker safety. Most of the cases, safety is the major concern for workers. When they feel safe in a workplace, it will increase productivity rapidly and that will contribute to the profit maximization. Secondly, it will be advancement opportunities. A worker is more likely to perform his best when advancement opportunities exist and he can find a bright future with the corporation, in lieu of working day-in and day-out that shows no chance to advance or excel. Future companies will give workers opportunities to expand their knowledge and keep up-to-date we information with latest technology by paying for seminars and professional courses and catering them updated training manuals.
Last but not least, paid vacation would be very useful for the future business. The worker should be rewarded for their hard work by giving them paid vacation so that they can spend time with their family and friends. This will definitely boost their energy and motivate to work more.
In conclusion, I want to say that when workers feel that the company takes their interest to heart, then workers will take company interest to heart. So in future, what business owners will need is keep their promises and show compassion for their workers. Company will provide resources to help workers be more efficient at their job. Every company will find what is crucial for workers and will give it to them.

Affluent parents tend to send their children to private schools. Parents that send their kids to private school need not pay taxes for public school system. From the view of the people deriving no direct benefit from the state education system, they do not see the point. It is viewed as a policy that sucks more money out of the pockets of taxpayers for apparently useless expenditure. I completely disagree with the notion. In a society where we deserve people to have certain services and society to function the way we expect, we will always need to pay for something we do not need, I think.
At times education was privilege. But when the state had discerned the importance of education, it acknowledged that education should be a right. The state introduces public education system through taxes. Public school system ensures the education for all, since education is crucial for our society, our communities, and our economy. In this instance, everybody should contribute to the state education system for the betterment of it. That is to say that better schools produce better educated students who get better salary that allow people to make a better life for their families and pay taxes for more investment in our schools, roads, parks, and so forth; there is that virtuous cycle again. My point is that whether you have children in public schools or not, you benefit by making sure that all children get a quality education that all public schools provide.
Americans have also experienced, from at least the time of Thomas Jefferson that a high-quality state education system accessible to all is extremely important to constructing a vibrant democracy in which intelligent and engaged citizens constructively debate public policy decisions. Thomas Jefferson himself wrote to James Madison in 1787: “Above all things I hope the education of the common people will be attended to; convinced that on their good sense we may rely with the most security for the preservation of a due degree of liberty.”
In conclusion, I want to return to the view the parents of children in private schools should be exempt. If I, as a taxpayer, choose to car to work, my taxes still go to repair the roads and if I use public transportation same thing happens. That is quite logical, because my daily bread comes in trucks that use those roads. If I get hit by a car, the ambulance will need those roads to carry me to the hospital. This means that not all benefits in society are direct, that does not seem they are non-existent.

Write about the following topic:
Some people feel that entertainers (e.g. film stars, pop stars, musicians or sports stars) are paid too much money.
Do you agree or disagree. Which other type of job should be highly paid.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
Celebrities in the entertainment business are phenomenally popular, and usually earn a substantial sum of money beyond compare with other important domains. The question of whether or not they should deserve over paid has sparked a heated debate. Some people find it quite acceptable, but on the other hand, others opine that it is simple unfair as teachers are playing the most important role in the society, but earn less than those celebrities.
There is not a shade of doubt that entertainers get bigger salaries. Celebrities have a great acceptance and influence on the people’s thought of process. They are very popular people in the world. Salaries are usually determined by the supply and demand in human resource market. The salary rises only when the number of vacancies is provided by the employers outnumbers the candidates and vice versa. In this case, the supply is very few in terms of successful entertainers, sports or film stars.
However, the proponents of teachers believe that teachers are important to be paid more than the celebrities. They claim the reason is that the teachers perpetuate the advancement of human civilization. It is quite true, but the society we live in is profoundly influenced by the market economy, in which the worth depends on supply and demand law. That is to say, the salary of teachers is determined by the reciprocal action of supply and demand in a market. Currently, the supply of teachers surpasses its demand on the one hand, and the supply of famous celebrities does not exceed its demand, on the other. Consequently, celebrities are paid much more than the teachers.
All in all, I want to say that the huge salary a sports or film star gets is quite justified. My point is that they have proved themselves as having rare talent and they should deserve rewards.

Write about the following topic:
Tests and examinations are a central feature of school systems in many countries. Do you think the educational benefits of testing outweigh any disadvantages?
Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Tests and examinations are a formal, systematic procedures used to gather information about a student’s performance on the basis of which conclusions are drawn about the more general rudimentary skill of the student  become the cornerstone of education systems in many nations. However, these evaluation systems have contributed to the debate that the benefits of these assessments outweigh the detriments or not. Although such exams have some merits, I personally believe that it induces bad impact on students.
Tests refer to any kind of measurement technique which aims at describing the students’ proficiency have some certain benefits. First of all, tests or exams are usually administered at mid-and-end point of the academic year and, they determine what a student has learnt pertaining to stated course outcomes. Secondly, assessments identify the feeble areas in which a student needs further help. In this instance, the main goal of the test is to help teachers decide what needs to be taught to the students.
On the flip side, in spite of the above mentioned advantages, some limitations still remain. There is always an inherent limitation in judging the student’s competence under set condition and limited time. Many a times it can be happened that a student who is otherwise good may feel stress in the exam and may performed not as adequately as usual which leads to inferior result. In addition, when a student does not good grades he is put under pressure, both by the teachers and parents, to have good results. Most of the cases, the student cannot combat with such stress and he may involve in drug addiction or the worst case is he might suicide to relive from the extreme pressure of the exams. From my own experience I see that education is so emphasized that not getting good grades very often considered as failing to attain your goal and, thereby, failing your own and family’s prospect. Consequently, students learn to measure the world and themselves solely through a pedagogic lens. Two decades ago a studious friend of mine suffered from an episode of psychosis and committed suicide due to he did not cope with stress of the exams. I can still recall his suicidal note that said “not living to expectations”.  Ironically, in my friend’s family, there was an unwritten rule is that you are how well you do in the exams.
In conclusion, although there is no better tools except exams for evaluating a student’s merit, tests or exams still have some implicit drawbacks, which, sometimes, lead to unexpected results.

Write about the following topic:
Some people prefer to live in a house, while others think that there are more advantages living in an apartment.
Are there more advantages than disadvantages to living in a house rather than in an apartment?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
Some people have predilection for living in a house while others would much rather have an apartment. The truth is that there are always two flips to every coin and it is a subject to personal priority and lifestyle. In this essay, I am going to explore the advantages and disadvantages that come with living in apartment or house.
To commence with, a house is the proverbial castle for human being. There are several points to make in preferring house, particularly privacy. People are mostly free to do with their home what they like. Space and nature add extra benefits of owing a house. There is heavenly touch of thinking that the plenty of room to do whatever owner wish and the neat and clean ambiance. Just imagine that you sit on your back porch with the lights off and sees the Milky Way at night. Though there are plenty of issues in owing a house, there are also several drawbacks. The main limitation is that the property maintenance costs money and takes time, even for handy owners.
On the other hand, a large number of people want to live in apartments. Apartment buildings usually come with a series of amenities, for example gym, beauty salon, community centre, playground for the kid, etc. in addition, these buildings also have 24 hours security which is indeed a welcomed feature. Other benefits that offer apartments comprise close by clubs, bars, restaurants, and so on. However, there are certain limitations that you have to take into account if you prefer to live in an apartment. Privacy comes first into consideration. You may not have a lot of privacy in an apartment. For instance, as you share the walls with your neighbors, you have to be cautious and not irritate them.
In conclusion, preference of owing house or apartment is a very subjective issue depending on ability mostly. Although, having house is obviously is a part of dream, apartments meet the increasingly demand of residence. The city dwellers are more likely to prefer apartments rather than house from a realistic viewpoint.

As part of a class assignment you have to write about the following topic.
Millions of people every year move to English-speaking countries such as Australia, Britain or America, in order to study at school, college or university.
Why do so many people want to study in English?
Why is English such an important international language?
Give reasons for your answer.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
In schools, colleges or universities in America, Australia, and England, which fascinate a large number of international students, the primary language of instruction is English. English is the language used in every activity at the most of the top medical centers, business schools, and advanced-study institutions. Most reference books, journals, and technical periodicals that give global kudos to the doctors, engineers, scientists, and technologist are printed in English. In this essay, I will discuss why students have predilection for study in English as well as the importance of English as a global language.
The world has been transformed into a global village and English has attained the glory of being global language. Consequently, English attracts a significant number of people, especially students.  Students consider the two factors: medium of higher study and future of career. In the most cases, the medium of teaching in higher learning is English. In addition, as we have already embraced technological era, technology serves in every sphere of life, particularly learning period. In this instance, the elementary language of technological devices and of internet is English. Therefore, students logically prefer study in English. Another vital reason for choosing English is job opportunity. There are multitude avenues for the person who has good command over the English language. The transnational companies appoint professionals with multilingual skills but also expect the candidates to have English speaking, listening, reading and writing skill.
The significance of English is enormous, namely in politics, trade and commerce. Firstly, there is not a shadow of doubt that the United States has a great influence on political affairs and international relations for the last six decades. American influence has contributed to the primacy of the English language. So, in order to better understand the nuance and craft of global affairs, concern people have no other choice but to learn English. The language, however, also create manifold opportunities in international markets and region. A businessman who is competent enough in English language can utilize trade opportunities available at every nook and corner of the world.
In conclusion, it goes without saying that English has become lingua franca. The language enjoys the official status even in the nations where it is not the primary spoken language. Communicative skill in English is crucial to enter and ultimately succeed in mainstream world.

Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the work place. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer.
What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university?
Give reasons for your answer.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
It goes without saying that university has great contributions to the human civilization. In recent years, the question of universities’ function has sparked a heated debate. Some people contend that universities should embrace skills-driven programmes that enable students to acquire business acumen and mandatory competencies needed in the workplace. Yet others believe that universities should emphasize on knowledge production, whether or not it is useful to an employer. Personally, I would argue that universities have to gravitate its attention in knowledge for knowledge’s sake. Let me clarify it, only knowledge can enlighten us so that we can remove all our obstacles that hinder our progress.
Although, there are some proponents of the idea that we should get career-oriented education from the universities, I think that we should never confine universities’ role to the employers’ need. Since there may likely to happen that the boundless possibilities of knowledge can be reduced into the pocket of commercially value courses, end of the day, it would produce a good worker, not a good citizen.
On the other hand, tertiary education’s aim should be the teaching of how to extract knowledge and how to produce knowledge. Because, the world we live in is consistently changing. So frequently, we need to introduce new technology in order to response to the new situation. In that case, if we limited our education to job related courses, we will know manually how to do a particular work in a particular situation. This will cruelly abolish our ability in producing knowledge. As a result, we cannot ride on the flow of change and our civilization would be motionless.
In fine, universities should play the role in the development of full human potential in terms of knowledge or wisdom. By educating student to be capable of producing new knowledge and creative responses to the ever changing condition, universities can serve its true responsibility.

Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment in essential to control violence in society.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
You should write at least 250 words.
You should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.
Model Answer: 
The death sentence tends to be a lightning rod for debate and discussion because the deep feeling and emotions as it evokes as it relates to living in a safe society. Every day we learn the news about many heinous crimes with the help of print or electronic media that leaves a deep mark of fear in the country’s collective consciousness. As a result many people still feel a strong need for death penalty to mitigate their fears of these crimes. I am of the honest opinion that the insanity of death penalty should be stopped as soon as possible.
To begin with, there is no conclusive evidence that the death penalty is a deterrent to the crimes they are intended to curb. As a matter of fact, in the states of USA where death penalty is banned there have been steadily lower rates of murder than in the states where there is death penalty instituted. Moreover, more and more states have dropped death penalty; the overall murder rate of America has consistently decreased.
Again, justice systems around the world are erroneous to some extent and wrong judgment takes place more often we would like to believe. Therefore, there is always a possibility of miscarriage of judgment results in wrongful and irreversible punishment to the innocent. The spirit of justice lies emphasis on to ensure no innocent people is convicted in any circumstance. The probability of punishing innocent people is sufficient to make the issue for repeal of death penalty.
To recapitulate, the champions of death penalty contend that “eye for an eye” approach deter crimes, and is the best way to provide justice to the affected people by heinous crimes. But the evidence tells different story. Therefore, I would like to say that the death penalty is not only barbaric but equally pointless.

Write about the following topic:

Recently the freedom to work and live anywhere has become the main trend due to the development of communication technology and transportation.
Do the advantages of these developments outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
Over the last two decades, man has achieved an unprecedented success in communication and transportation with the help of technological revolution. Technology has blurred the lines between office and home. Now, people can do their task no matter where they are. As every coin has two flip sides, the advance of technology has also dark side. Consequently, the question very often arises that the benefits of these developments preponderate its shortcomings or not. Despite of all of its limitations, the advantages of these developments have surpassed its disadvantages.
Technology has changed the way we live and work. Work is no longer something we do at specific place or time; work can be done anywhere and anytime. A very good example here is internet. With the help of this amazing tool, man can do his job wherever he stays. Furthermore, internet renders manifold opportunities. People are now able to do several works through outsourcing around the world. On the other hand, due to the high speed transportation system, people not only travel from one city to another very easily and quickly, but equally can one country to another. People have no need to live near the work place. They can easily commute from home to office in a minimum time. Take Kolkata city for example. Every day, hundreds of thousands of people come to the city for work and return to their homes finishing the jobs. In addition, one of the outstanding aspects of these advancements is accessibility. People triumph the physical distance and are able to connect with others instantly at their fingertips. A case in point is smart phone, with which they can communicate from entirely different locations in real time.
On the flip side, there are also negative sides. Communication technology makes it difficult to focus, pay attention and connect with others. Although people can easily stay connected with each other through high tech communication system, it can also keep them apart. Imagine today’s people interaction. It is quite frequent that people are keeping an eye on their phone screen while they are talking to each other. So, they are physically together, but they are not totally paying attention and focused on each other. At least, they are partly attentive to a beep signaling that there is a missed call, new text message or email.
From what has been discussed above we may draw the conclusion that both points of view have their merits. Although these developments have negative impact on our life, its contributions will always overlap its disadvantages.

Write about the following topic:
Some people think that it is necessary to travel to other places to learn about other cultures. Others say that books, films and the Internet can be used as a source of information about different cultures.
Do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
Over the history, man has always been traveling one place to another in order to gain information and acquaint with several cultures. But in last two decades, with advancement of technology, one is able to be acquainted with different cultures through different mediums, such as internet, movies, books, and so forth. The question of whether alternative source of information like books, films and internet can be used to have information of other cultures rather than visit there personally has become a much debated issue. There are, therefore, people on both side of the view who have argument either for or against. To some extent, I disagree with the notion that books, films or internet is better source for information about other culture than first-hand experience.
Historically, we have reached where no human has reached before, hooked up to apps offering unprecedented exposure to the world in which we live. Technology blurs the boundaries between countries. Now we can get information of nation which is thousands of miles away from us by just a click. For example, if you want to know about the lifestyle of Eskimo, what you need is just to go any search engine like Google and you find plenty of sites about Eskimo. Besides, we can learn from documentary films or books. Accordingly, there are manifold avenues for learning information about different cultures.
On the other hand, there is a nuance between simply learning about a culture from secondary sources and physically experiencing it and eventually discerning the several traits of it, something which can never be gained otherwise. To fully understand a community, it is necessary to be part of the culture for extended time and should observe how the culture has evolved over the period. A case in point is anthropologists, who study cultural behavior of a community by physically experiencing territory. This does not mean that everybody who wants to understand various culture need to be an anthropologist. Rather I want to say that if anyone wants a comprehensive understanding about a culture, he must visit to the land and should observe the cultural pattern instead of learning from second hand experience.
From what has been discussed above we may draw the conclusion that both points of view have their rationales. Although it is possible to learn various cultures simply by surfing internet or reading books without ever visiting the country and people, traveling the place and being part of the community provides a holistic apprehension of the culture than the simple secondary sources can ever provide.

It’s generally believed that some people are born with certain talents, for instance for music and sport, and others are not. However it’s sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become good sports person or musician.
Discuss the two ideas giving your opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
A commonly held belief is that some people have innate skills, especially in music and sport. The proponents of this opinion think of it as a gift which is impossible to attain only by training or practice. Yet others believe that any one can be good at sports or music if he gets proper training. I am of the honest opinion is that when it is about exceptionally talented; this is obviously a matter of gift.
To begin with, everybody has the ability to be good at anything through proper training and correct methods with strict discipline. People can acquire some skills when they are enthusiastic to be good in those skills. There are various institutions with particular purpose to train people in special skills. Interested people can learn particular skill from these institutions by dedicated practice.
It is, however, clear that some people are born with congenital talents such as sport and art skills. They have the natural ability of being good at particular fields. In this instance, I want to focus not on good but on exceptionally good. A case in point is a study by Drs. Micheal Lombardo and Robert Deaner of Grand Valley State University’s biology and psychology departments. Although, the study sample was small, but highly sophisticate. They select a field of twenty seven sprinters included 8 fastest male sprinters and 15 Olympic gold medalists in U.S history. They found that the most sprint champions were the fastest kids in their neighborhood, even before they did any formal training or received any coaching.
To put in a nutshell, I do not want to say that talent trumps everything. Obviously, the significance of training is undeniable, particularly the kinds of training focused by the deliberate practice model. But in extraordinary cases, inborn capacity comes first.

As most people spend a major part of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual well-being.
What factors contribute to job satisfaction?
How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
It goes without saying that in adulthood most people engage in jobs for their living where job contentment is crucial component of individuals’ welfare. There are several issues lie in job gratification. But it is absurd to think of job satisfaction for all job holders.
Satisfaction is a subject to highly relative that satisfaction means different things to different people. Nevertheless, there are some prime considerations to be counted in job contentment. The first and foremost factor is that of handsome wage. It tends that almost every job seeker has predilection for highly paid salary. Secondly, work environment is another incentive issue for applying a job.   A favorable environment includes hygienic workplace, helpful coworkers, sympathetic management, etc. in which a worker generally feels pleasure. Last but not the least, job security is also an important element that greatly contributes to the job satisfaction.
However, no job seems to perfect pertaining to satisfaction. A well-paid job often goes with very stressful condition and vice versa. Moreover, in many cases, people have no option but do the job whatever it is satisfactory or not. For example, people who are in a position that they have to earn to pay mortgages, bills or everyday living cost. In this instance, necessity is of much greater concern than job satisfaction. However, this is not to say that I am against the idea that there are no such occupations. Indeed, there are excellent jobs in which people are serving with great contentment. This means that what I want to say is that all occupations is found satisfactory is an absurd idea.
In conclusion, job satisfaction is very subjective notion. It leans on how an employee looks at his job he is serving. However, although there are so many nice jobs, but the hope for all workers pleased with their occupations would be unrealistic.

The position of women in society has changed markedly in the last twenty years. Many of the problems young people now experience, such as juvenile delinquency, arise from the fact that many married women now work and are not at home to care for their children.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
You should write at least 250 words.
You should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.
Model Answer: 
The proverbial role of women has undergone a striking change over the last two decades. They are stepping out of their home after being deprived by the patriarch society’s economic reality. They have also started the role as a breadwinner. Consequently, most of the married women unable to spend quality time with their children. This causes several problems like juvenile related crimes.
It is undeniable phenomenon that women are endowed with Almighty’s blessings in upbringing the offspring. It is who are mostly responsible for rearing their children. However, teenagers are like clay ought to be shaped by the mothers as like the potters shape their potteries. To play this role meticulously, women should share a significant amount of time with their young adults to raise them as a good citizen of the society.
However, the increasing number of working married women imparts worries in rearing up children. Most of the working married women spend eight hours of their day or sometimes even more. Accordingly, they have no time for their offspring. Children are failed to communicate with their mothers and deprived from moral, psychological, or physiological development. Moreover, the values of job holder mothers decline remarkably. They care more about their jobs rather than their children. Children very often protest and do bad things in order to attract their mothers’ attention in response. Not only that, they also involve in several anti-social activities. Lately a study shows that the crime rate of Australian youth in the last three years has increased by 40%, and among these young adults, over ninety percent of their mothers have a well-paid-full-time occupation.
To sum up, I am of the view that each and every mother should serve her motherhood duties first. Because nation’s future depends on children and their future depends on mothers.

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
The issue whether the children should be taught to compete and reach the top or to let them co-operate each other without competing is a debatable issue. While some people opine that, positive competitions among kids are always good and this helps children to supersede others in their perspective fields, the other group completely opposes this viewpoint. According to the second group, competition and the desire to reach the top is not a moral lesson we should teach our children and rather they should work together for the greater benefits of the world. Both parties have their reasons to express their view points and in this essay I will explain both of these view points from my own experience and view point.
First of all, positive competition among children is always good. It helps children to do even better than the way they would usually perform. Though some people would deny that this is a positive thing but I am sure all of them will want their children to become the top scorers or best performers in the school. The city schools have more talented students at a certain period than the rural schools and one of the main reasons for this is the competitions the city school-students face is much higher than the pressure and competition rural-school students face. This proves the better side of competitions in positive way. On the other hand, the positive competition always creates a desire to work harder and try over and over again to reach at the top and this enhances the overall performance.
On the contrary, the competitive mentality in children would last in them throughout their lives. So if the parents and teachers teach them to compete each other, they would start doing competition in every way possible and that would include them to do some unfair and immoral actions. They would always want to stay ahead and sometimes disappointment would ruin their success. Considering this cooperation and team playing seem a better way of addressing the better performance issue among children.
In conclusion, positive competition can bring many benefits among children as this brings best performance among kids while the mentality of competing always in all perspective can be a bad example to set for our next generation.

Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
In this modern era, there is no scope for deciding whether a particular responsibility is for females or for males. Moreover, we should not avert people from becoming what they wish to be, in this instance, learn what they wish to learn. Instead of this, we should inspire people to combat with the social bias. So, I firmly contend that we should not permit a certain gender to eclipse anything in the modern society.  To do so, we should make it compulsory for colleges or universities to nominate male and female equally in each course.
To begin with, male and female do not think in the same way or do thing similarly or even believe identically. These differences lead to a great advantage, I think. First of all, they do not gestate alike, creative and innovative ideas will finally emerge from each of them in every topic they are into. They will judge things from different perspective that result in a balanced expression of insight which can ensure and improve their apprehension of various subject matters. Thirdly, when the equal number of male and female is constitute a class, the communication proficiency is sharpened, the relationship between them will be more harmonious and it would be very worthy if they start working in team. Finally, it ensures the equality of the society ultimately that many societies are ready to accept ability of both in any way for the sake of better society.
All in all, I believe that education is the key to solve every problem, if men and women function jointly as equals many other mundane issues can be resolved with haste, whether it is be social, pedagogical, or politics related. What we need to understand is that the world cannot run efficiently with half of its population treated as inferior citizens. Females will gift a new perspective and that is what is needed in today’s society.

“Prevention is better than cure.”
Out of a country’s health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
You should write at least 250 words.
You should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.
Model Answer :
Nowadays, governments in every country particularly in wealthy countries governments tend to allocate a significant portion of budget to the health sector. They realize that only a healthy nation can enhance efficiency and can boost productivity. But, now the question of whether or not the government should distribute a large proportion of the country’s budget health education and precautionary steps has sparked a heated debate. In that case, I am of the honest opinion that the best time to fight disease is before it strikes.
To begin with prevention is always good rather than remedy. Take sub-Saharan Africa as an example. The unprecedented success of numerous prevention programs implemented in these territories such as widespread bednet distribution program, national childhood vaccination schemes, and large-scale deworming programs suggest that the majority of the adverse effects of epidemic diseases can be chipped away solely before they take place. Besides, lately, the treatment cost has increased staggeringly. There is lot more people who simply cannot afford its cost, yet in many instances by allocating mere amount we can prevent needs of people for treatment. To achieve this goal, I think that lifestyle changes from the early ages might be crucial in preventing many diseases. Therefore, government should take program on educating people how to lead a healthy life. For example, many doctors suggest that postponing menarche might prevent breast cancer.
However, no one can put aside the importance of hospital, doctor or medicine. It would be unwise to allocate a tiny budget on the treatment of people who are contracted with diseases, like heart diseases, rheumatic fever, and so on. Government should give adequate money to the researchers so that they can search for cures and for the development of new medicines.
To sum up, I contend that prevention is the first aid to obviate diseases. So, what we need is to educate people about hygienic lifestyle.

In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies.
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
In many countries students prefer to take a year off after finishing their school and then get engaged either in jobs or travel to enhance their experiences before starting their university education. In many ways, this is a great opportunity to improve the experience and skill and on the contrary there are some negative aspects of this as well.
First of all, taking a year off and then doing jobs before starting university education gives the students a perfect opportunity to learn about the job sectors. This in terms of learning about the practical works, job environment, other colleagues, and challenges in executing tasks is a very important experience that would prepare those students to become better leaders in job sectors. The study environment and job environment are not same and those students would be better prepared for the future. Those who decide to travel instead of getting involved in jobs also learn about different cultures, meet many new people and are better prepared to interact with others.
Then, students who have practical job experience would do better in their university education because they would be able to relate the educational aspects with the practical world. They would be more focused on education and their interpersonal skill would be much better. Finally, traveling and practical job experiences are two vital aspects that could not be gained in any other ways. There are other benefits of this trend as well including: gaining self-confidence, improving social interactions etc. those skills are important for future generations who would lead the future.
On the flip-side of the coin, there are some negative aspects of taking gaps amid of education years. First of all, not all students can manage the necessary expenses to travel and they might spend the time in unproductive way. The students who take leaves from their education might find it difficult to get back to the harmony of continuing the education. In is not uncommon among students not to return to university as they start earning money. To ensure a better generation, some people discard the idea of taking leaves and emphasize on continuing education and in fact they have their reason to believe that.
In conclusion, if the gap taken from educational institutes to get involved in jobs or to travel different countries is spent wisely, it would bring more benefits than drawbacks. This important aspect should be decided based on a student’s academic performance, economic condition, adherence to education and the future prospect of it.

Present a written argument or case to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic.
Fatherhood ought to be emphasised as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
You should write at least 250 words.
You should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.
Model Answer: 
The notion of only mother rearing their children is decaying day by day. Conversely, ‘men and women should have their childcare duties evenly’ has become current vogue. Personally, I firmly believe that man can play an important role in raising children together with woman.
To begin with, modern era deserves father’s role as caregiver and chip away at the hackneyed idea that stresses only motherhood. In this era, the socioeconomic condition has changed dramatically. The living standard and its maintenance have increased than ever before. Many a time, it becomes hard for father to ensure the minimum living standard. As a result, mothers are also working hard to earn living and they do not have all the free time they used to have to take care of their children. After spending a significant amount of time at workplace, it is really tough for her to help the kids with their homework, cooking food for them, washing and ironing their dresses etc. To that end, the reality demands that the father should also involve in managing the house and bringing up their offspring.
Similarly, many studies show that paternal parenting is good for a child’s physical, cognitive, psychological and behavioral improvement. Father’s influence translates the children into well-adjusted children. Children who can enjoy a quality time with their fathers get better grades, peer relationships and have higher self-esteem revealed in several studies.
In conclusion, father’s presence is the greatest gift in a child’s life. I want to say that fatherhood is the utmost important job a man have in his life. I do not think that fathers’ role is less important or less effective than mothers’ in raising children. Rather, I am of the opinion that both father and mother have equal role to play in raising their child.

Research indicates that the characteristics we are born with have much more influence on our personality and development than any experiences we may have in our life.
Which do you consider to be the major influence?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer 1:
The characteristics we are born with and the characteristics we acquire throughout our lives are both important while determining our overall behaviours and characteristics. In my opinion both has equal influences on our personal development and defining who we really are.
The nature and nurture are the two factors that contribute in making an individual. The inherited characteristics can’t be denied as it determines the basic formation of human; like how we look, how we think etc. These characteristics are often shaped by the later experiences and development we face in our lives. This is how a modest son of a very rude people can be an exemplary personality in our society. And on the contrary an honest father might have a dishonest son.
The by-born physiognomies are something we will have to bear in our entire life. But, there is always a chance that we would become different in many perspectives from our ancestors because we have different experience in our lives and we were raised in different societies. As human we will always be afraid of darkness and imaginary ghosts as we have got these things in our gene from the ancient people. Someone who has never seen a ghost will be afraid of it at some time in his life. On the contrary, we have the perfect opportunity to build ourselves in the way we want through education, experience, social structure and our determination.
There is no definitive way of determining which of the two factors influences us most as there are always the exceptions on either way to discard any hypothesis. For instance, if nature and genetic code was the most important factor to determine our characteristics, we would always have been like our ancestors. In another way, if the experience and surrounding environment was the determining factor, then all of the students in a class would perform equally as they would get the same facility to perform well. But neither one is a universal fact.
Model Answer 2: 
Scientific studies show that inborn traits have a deeper impact on our personality as compared to the experiences gain from our daily life. While the argument has merits, I believe that the situations we face during the course of our life have a stronger effect on our personality and temperament.

As part of a class assignment you have to write about the following topic.
Some governments say how many children a family can hare in their country. They may control the number of children someone has through taxes. It is sometimes necessary and right for a government to control the population in this way.
Do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
Over population is one of the pressing problems appears in the world. The demographic problem has led to the question of whether or not government should take step to curb the problem. Some people contend that government should make policies for controlling the problem. Surely, government ought to introduce programs to subdue the crisis. But when it is about taxes, I strongly oppose the idea. Rather, I believe that other means can be applied except imposing tax.
First of all, the decision of giving birth enjoys the fundamental rights of individuals, I think. For the governments has no right to intrude in their personal life. We must acknowledge individuals’ right.  What I want to say is that it is the couples who should solely decide the number of children they can have. In this case, the government can employ some incentive program. For example, government can render some special facilities like scholarship for their children of the small families.
However, in many third world countries, the main cause of the population explosion directly lies in illiteracy, poverty, and unhealthy lifestyle. So, introducing extra taxes would propel them to a more appalling condition. At this point, the government can introduce some educational campaigns so that people can understand the pitfall of overpopulation. In addition, imposing extra taxes undermines the spirit of democracy. Because it is the clear manifestation of unequal approach by the state, it is in this sense that it is a kind of discrimination that allow affluent people to have as many children as they want, whereas poorer people confined at this instance.
To recapitulate, it goes without saying that over population engender severe crisis with both individuals and the states. I feel that whether to have many children is a very personal matter that should be made by the couples. They should have the right to make decision for themselves. The government can undertake educational program that points out the avenue a modest number of family members can ensure an improved quality of life for the family members as well as less strain on the states.

Some people believe that children are given too much free time. They feel that this time should be used to do more school work.
How do you think children should spent their free time?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
Childhood is the most precious time of our life. However, many people consider that kids are given lots of leisure time. They claim that this time should be properly utilized by doing homework, if not it would be waste of time. I, personally, do not think so. Instead, I believe that free time occupied in playing fosters creativity and emotional development of a child.
First of all, free time means leisure time for children. That is to say that they are away from stresses of school or chores. This time certainly should be spent whatever they want to do without any interference of adults. In this case, playing is a refreshing recess from learning. From that point, summer vacation is just a long break. Hence, I will show an alternative point of view that should be obvious but apparently is not; that is playing is learning. At play, kids can learn the most important skills of real life, the ones that cannot be taught in the classes. To acquire these skills, children need lots of play. For example, just think of a team sport, like cricket, soccer or baseball. These sports allow children to learn several social skills, most importantly the one that is the team spirit. They are taught how to work as team towards a common objective.
Again, unstructured plays can stimulate and germinate child’s imagination and polish creative and cognitive abilities. These plays can also strengthen critical thinking and problem solving skills in kids to help successful school career.
In conclusion, I would like to cite that many research studies infer that children pay more attention after they have had a break, an unstructured recess in which they are allowed to play without any interference. Therefore, when it is about the overall development of children, children are needed adequate free time to be spent as their wish.

Nowadays we are producing more and more rubbish.
Why do you think this is happening?
What can governments do to help reduce the amount of rubbish produced?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
In this industrial era, thousands of millions of tons rubbish are being produced around the world every day. This garbage generates in many ways and thus it becomes a pressing problem regarding ecology. Both the government and individuals should be aware of this grave problem without any delay. Otherwise, there will be a disaster waiting for us.
Sever factors lie in increasing the amount of rubbish. Firstly, as we all know that the earth can assimilate all the organic things like fruits, vegetables, human or animal body, and so forth, which is good for environment. But due to the technological advancement, plastic and metal are being used as packaging that is resistant to degradation makes real cause for rubbish. Secondly, the lifestyle of people is also account for garbage. People are now more consumptive than ever before. Therefore the wastage of their consumption is proliferating automatically. Moreover, now people tend to just throw out their old electronic devices, such as cell phone, monitor, laptop and so on, and these all cause the electronic wastage.
However, to solve this problem, both the government and citizen have to undertake few courses. First of all, the government needs to devise a good waste-management policy and Sweden is a good example to be mentioned here. A recycling revolution has taken place there. They have proved themselves as a very good waste management country in the world. The Scandinavian country is now closer to zero waste. Even, the country is importing garbage from the neighborhood countries to feed their thirty two waste-to-energy plant. As a result, the country transforms the garbage into commodity. The government should also restrict the production of plastic packaging and can encourage organic products like jute or paper bags. Secondly, people should change their habit of consumption. Besides, they ought to use recycled and biodegradable package.
To sum up, it is we who should have the responsibility to keep the place living friendly where we live. In order to do so, we have to follow fairly hard-and-fast rules when it comes to managing our waste, both for households and more industries and municipalities.

Write about the following topic:
Successful sports professionals can earn a great deal more money than people in other important professions. Some people think this is fully justified while others think it is unfair.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer :
Nowadays, it seems that reputed sport professionals make a lot more money in respect of some other dignified occupations. The fact of whether or not sport professionals should deserve the salary has become a controversial issue to a great extent. In this essay I am going to set forth both the views and after that I will draw my conclusion.
To commence with, many individuals deem that sportsmen are paid exorbitant amount of money for what they do, while there are some other professionals who plays a significant role to serve the community but paid less. They claim that it is absolutely injustice. For instance, US marine, who risks his life to save the country, get paid a tiny salary compare to a sportsman.  There are also certain contributory occupations that serve a magnificent role to advance the mankind, such as scientist, engineer, teacher, doctor, and so on, are not paid as well as a popular sports star. They stand for these professionals, since they are contributing lot more for the welfare of the society and the nation as well.
Some people, however, contend that famous sports stars deserve high salary. A player or athlete exercises diligently to attain skills by spending enormous energy and time on the field. For instance, any celebrated sportsman has to go through many years of schooling to acquire the competence and physical fitness required. Moreover, career lifespan is significantly shorter than any other profession. It is quite normal that a successful player spent his whole life in the teens to become a successful player and then retire unfortunately in the 30s as a consequence of injury or lack or physical fitness. However, an eminent player can build a strong brand image that contribute to the product selling to a great extent. That is why, Coca-Cola Company frequently uses sports star as a model for its advertising. Accordingly, successful sports professional’s income is valid in terms of justice.
To put in a nutshell, I contend that a reputed sports star proves himself that he is worthy of getting a handsome amount of salary. So, there is nothing wrong with it if he deserves such amount, I think.

Creative artists should always be given freedom to express their own ideas (in words, picture, music, film) in whichever way they wish. There should be no government restrictions on what they do.
To what extend do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
One of the most controversial issues nowadays is whether the creative artists like film-makers, writers, artists, photographers should be given absolute freedom to present their thinking or not. While in some countries the government strictly imposes restriction on this freedom, in many other countries those innovative artists and writers get their freedom to express their view. In my opinion, the freedom should be given to those creative artists both by the society and government but the artists should not be influenced by their personal gain and biasness.
First of all, the people who are in writing, journalism, art, music and film-making industries are considered to be very creative and are the voices of the humanity. Their way of working involves creativity and social responsibilities. Thus, they present the idea and imagination in their works and often represent the oppressed people. They contributed throughout the history and have greatly contributed towards making the worlds a better place. The creative mind like Leonardo Da Vinci is an icon to the world and his contribution is invaluable. Imposing restriction on creative minds is an act that can only kill the potential of a great work. The writers use their experience and blend their imagination to create legendary works while journalists or photographers catch the history in their pen and camera. If they are given the freedom, we will never know the heinous act of an evil leader in a distant part of the world. They help us building a better society and represent the expression of mass people. The dictator government would only want to impose restriction only to kill the voice that might go against them.
On the contrary, the creative writers have their own responsibilities not to present something that would hurt the people’s belief. While depicting a religious view in a negative way might seem to be an act of creativity to some people, it would actually hurt millions’ of people’s feeling. The great mind should be aware of such controversy and focus on doing something better for people. Their works should not get influenced by any political axiom not should their output create a social crisis.
To reiterate, I strongly believe that the freedom is essential for creative artists to create great works and to contribute to give the opportunity to just an unjust, but they should work beyond any political motivation or personal achievement.

Write about the following topic:
Today the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold.
To what extent do you agree with these views?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer 1:
We all are surrounded by catchy commercial advertisements and undoubtedly, it has a great implication on consumer behavior. Most of the cases, people are provoked to buy products that are not response our need at all. In this essay, I will delineate how ads play a vital role in shaping buying decisions.
First of all, we have already embraced the technological era. That is to say, technology is available to all of us and through these technologies, companies’ ads reach us very easily. For instance, Companies could conduct advertising campaign incessantly with help of social media like facebook, twitter, etc. As a result, people impulsively buy the products that are actually unnecessary for them.
Secondly, a good advertising could play with human psychology. It could change mindset transforming needs into wants. Hand phone device is a good example here to be mentioned. Due to the hostile market, cell phone producers compete with each other to pursue the consumer buying their products using smart advertising which focuses on so many features that in fact, is not real requirement of the consumer. Individuals like to think that a phone with many features is a useful thing to use, yet it is not tailored with their needs. In other words, ads could create a popular vogue in terms of lifestyle. For instance, in our country, most of the students in primary level are keeping smart phones while they have no need to have sophisticated phone set at this level. They argue that they are just responding to the trend using the advanced technology. Consequently, the sale of cell phones is boosted by particular class of consumers.
Last but not the least, companies tend to use public figures, like film star, sportsman, media personality, etc. to build brand image. People tend to mimicry their favourite personalities. Therefore, company who uses prominent figure can create a good brand image very easily and a strong brand image has a great impact on sales rate. Take Sakib Al Hassan, the best all rounder in cricket, as an example. He is a brand ambassador of Liver Brothers Bangladesh Ltd. contributing in building brand image to a great extends.
In conclusion, we get information about different products from the advertisement. This helps us to compare various goods and to take the right decision. Therefore, we need to be aware of our genuine requirement so that we can make a sensible choice.
Sample Answer 2:
Advertisements are everywhere nowadays. Advertisements in newspapers, magazines, television channels, hoardings, pamphlets, and radio announcements are making consumers to want more and more regardless of their needs. We are surrounded by it all the time, hence it is impossible to escape from its effects.
We buy the product, whether it is required or not, because companies are targeting our decision making by showing glamorous advertisements on television. They show its products features in such a way that people get attracted towards it. Moreover, we never feel rich and content unless we wear or use the products endorsed by our favourite film-stars, sportsmen, and models. These things set a trend, and many more start following it in order to keep a pace with the society. For example, new smart-mobiles keeps coming in the market, and if somebody buys it regardless of his/ her requirements then many of his or her  friends and family members buys it  and this goes on and on.
On positive side, advertisement brings the awareness amongst the general public that certain product is introduced in the market with more advance qualities. So those who require it may buy it.
Whereas, it is not untrue that needs of the people has increased. With rise in their income, today they want to live more luxurious and comfortable life. Their increased purchasing power is giving them a free hand to buy whatever they want. Also there are some things which need to be bought. For example, with ever-changing technology in many fields, business houses have to buy it in order to compete in the market.
In conclusion, both, rise in the lifestyle of people and powers of advertisements are reasons behind the high earnings of the corporate world.

Happiness is considered very important in life.
Why is it difficult to define?
What factors are important in achieving happiness?
You should give reasons for your answer using your own ideas and experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
The definition and per-requisite of happiness vary from person to person and this is a feeling that comes from deep inside of our hearts. While some people consider sound personal life and economic freedom as the main sources of happiness, others seem like running for something else to achieve happiness in their lives. Thus, the concept of happiness is not something that can be described with a neat little theory.
There are numerous reasons why people can feel happy and among them mental satisfaction is the most important one. Only a contended soul can feel happiness even in adverse situation. Indeed, happiness is a state of mind and someone contended with whatever s/he has would be happy. Among other factors, success and fame can sometimes bring happiness, though they have their own costs. Sound body is another important factor for being happy in life. If someone has accumulated a great fortune but does not possesses a sound health, might feel unhappy quite often. The strong family bonding, sharing and caring are some other reasons that contribute to make us happy. Freedom, besides the other important factors, is a great way of feeling happiness. Freedom makes us happy naturally and we know the value of this only when we are deprived from it.
Many people find happiness by helping others and from religious rituals and those two habits are indeed very important aspects of life for being happy. Most important thing is the capability to hold on and carry on in opposing time to overcome it. Being happy is a mantra that everybody of us has inside our heart and mind. All we need to do is find it. This is part of life and possessing a satisfied mentality is the most important factor to be happy in life.

Compare the advantages and disadvantages of three of the following as media for communicating information. State which you consider to be the most effective.
• comics
• books
• radio
• television
• film
• theatre
You should write at least 250 words.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Model Answer:
In our daily life we heavily rely on the different media like TV, Film, newspaper, radio, internet books etc. as our main source of communicating information and these media greatly influence our personal and social life. All of those media have their own advantages and drawbacks. Some are easily accessible but are not reliable sources for information while some others are personal favourite for many people but are not widely used. In this essay I will pick three media for comparing their advantages and disadvantages and would explain why books are the best media for communicating information.
First of all, television is a widely used medium that can be found almost all of the houses in the world. It is easy to access and people from all backgrounds and economic conditions can accommodate a TV at their home. With the advancement of satellite technology, the TV viewers have plenty of options to choose from and watch the type of programs they prefer. The high competitions among the TV channels are helping people to get quality news, watch many educational and recreational programs and getting updated about the current events all around the globe all by sitting at their room. The audio-visual presentation of the TV programs make them more appealing compared to the radio and thus it is the most widely accepted medium for communicating information and current events. On the flip side, TV channels do not always broadcast quality programs and if a viewer does not pick quality channels, s/he might waste times watching it. Moreover, people spend their time mostly for entertainment purposes while sitting in front of the TV and very few people can wisely decide what to watch and what to avoid. The news presented on TV is often biased and can create social dilemma by doing so. Watching TV are highly addictive and if teenagers spend a lot of time watching TV channels can often perform poorly in their academic education. Thus TV offers both the tremendous advantages and a numerous disadvantages as a medium of communicating information.
Films are also a very effective media that not only gives recreation to people but also offers meaningful learnings to the viewers.  In this age of technological advancement, people can easily watch films at the cinema hall, home or even in their laptop while on move. Thus the easy access to films has made it one of the prominent medium for learning and entertainment. The films are made by a team of talented people and have often very prominent influence on us. The message and moral of a movie often touch the viewers and can shape their perspective in a positive way. Many movies are based on historical events and true stories and those films are a good source for education. On the contrary, poorly made films and movies made for commercial success only can deterioration the moral perspective of persons.
Finally, books are the best medium for communication as they are the bridge among generations and time. Books written hundreds of years ago still play a vital role to educate people, to teach them history and to open unknown horizon to people. There are plenty of good books to shape the people’s thought in a positive way and the knowledge and experience gathered by people are often passed to the new generation. The books written in ancient period like Greek era are still the inspiration for generations and many of them have made the world the way we see it now. The social structure, political view, the life style, religious belief and many other important aspects of our daily life are still shaped by the books written in earlier ages. The knowledge we know in different fields like Physics, Chemistry, Math, Astronomy, Arts, Business etc. are all the accumulated knowledge of previous generations and those were passed to us through books. There are very few drawbacks of books and it mostly depends on the readers who choose to read it. The disadvantage of books as a medium is that not many people can make the habit of reading books to learn from it.
Thus though all the given media have their own benefits and downsides, book in my opinion, is the best way of communicating information.

Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. Others, however think that change is always a good thing.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
Change is an ineluctable fact in life. Several changes may take place with or without ringing bell. Some people tend to embrace change, while others try to avert change in their lives. Before presenting my opinion, it would be wise to discuss the both sides carefully, I think.
People who have predilection for changes think that changes can elevate and ameliorate lives and facilitate progress and invention. First of all, changes unveil new opportunities, which help us to step forward. If we can acquire knowledge and experience from different changing context, we can make life better by utilizing these experiences. For example, an executive who easily coup with the new environment and new technology achieves better position in the job place and can earn handsome amount by which he can lead a cozy life. Secondly, by changes man can experiment different things which leads to new innovation that ultimately improves human civilization.
Some people, however, cannot welcome changes in their life. They tend to feel content in their current situation. These people claim that it is the best way to lead a safer life through maintaining current circumstance. They always try to take advantage from the familiar condition. They deem changes as stressful or challenging factors. In this instance, shift in new situation or condition offers them anxieties as to whether they can adapt with the new environment.
In conclusion, I suppose that we want or not change is indispensable part of our life. Moreover, life becomes more complex and dynamic in these days. Consequently, it would be wise to response to this dynamic process rather than obviate it. One thing we just to remember that we need to be fully aware of the negative effect regarding the change.

Some people believe that visitors to other countries should follow local customs and behaviour. Others disagree and think that the host country should welcome cultural differences.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
People tend to travel to different countries for vacation or official purposes. Some people believe that tourists should respect the native culture and way of life, while others contend that it is the duty of a host country appreciate the cultural variety. The essay is dealt with the both side and then the opinion will be presented.
It is quite natural that the visitors ought to comply with the social norm of the foreign territory. Firstly, it helps to avoid some bitter experience. For instance, in the month of Ramadan, it is restricted to eat openly in the Muslim countries. In this instance, any traveler should conform to the etiquette to avert unpleasant incidents. Besides, tourists can enrich themselves learning the local culture, their attitudes and values. Japan is a very good example to be mentioned here. Hence, travelers can participate many traditional ceremonial occasions like the famous tea ceremony and learn different types of bow and their meanings.
On the flip side, it is also very rational that host country should appreciate cultural diversity. First of all, local people can be acquainted with foreign culture that results in broadening their horizon of knowledge. In addition, it enhances the cultural tolerance and at the same time, it also can assuage the international tension. Secondly, tourism comes out to be a big boon for many countries. In this instance, an interesting evidence here is Anguilla. The drastic expansion of tourism improvements creates an excellent opportunity for new partnership with multinational companies and augments foreign investment in luxury tourism. Anguilla attains 75% GDP “(Gross Domestic Product) from its tourists’ expenditure.
In my opinion, both the views seem to have their own rationale to some extends. In a way, these attitudes improve cultures and at the same time, these also contribute to the economy. Therefore, respecting local culture and welcoming cultural diversity both can bring blessing for the world as well as for the host territory.

In many countries schools have severe problems with student behavior.
What do you think are the causes of this?
What solutions can you suggest?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Students’ bahaviour in schools is a serious problem in many countries and this is very negatively affecting the study environment and overall educational system in those countries. There are many different reasons for this issue and immediate solution of this issue is really important for overall progress in the education sector.
The way the students behave with their classmates, teachers and other staffs of the schools has a direct effect on the study environment and in recent days, the student’s attitude towards teachers and others has reached to an abhorrent situation. The political influence on some students and their direct involvement in politics is one of the main reasons of their unacceptable bahaviours and activities. Only a handful of political students are worsening the overall study environment of the school. The student politics should be refined and they should be inspired to work for the betterment of others, but not to show their muscle power.
The social changes, psychological degradation and lack of family bonding are some of the reasons that cause the students behave rudely and violently both in social and school environment. Children spend almost 5-6 years at home before attending schools and their morality, behaviours, attitude and other human characters are built up at that time. Considering this, the parents should always teach them the way they should behave.
The family background, powerful family, personal powers are three other reasons why students show improper attitudes at schools. Drug is another issue that might mislead many young people and put them in darkness. The government should make sure that the schools have proper environment to make sure the study to the students and the school authority should take some strict steps to wipe up the bad eggs from school if they hamper the school environment.
The teachers sometimes behave rudely in many countries and cruelly punish the students for silly reasons. That should not be the way of teaching and teachers should come forward to take the responsibilities to take care of the students as they for their own kids.
In conclusion, there is no single reason that has ruined the study environment and students’ behaviours in schools in many countries and a combines steps from parents, governments, students and school authority should be taken to address this pressing issue.

Some people think that it is better to educate boys and girls in separate schools. Others, however, believe that boys and girls benefit more from attending mixed schools.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer: 
It is a growing trend in many schools separating boys and girls in the classroom. The question of whether or not the pupils should be segregated by in the classroom turns into a very controversial issue. Many individuals contend that single-sex education is more advantageous, while others oppose to the notion. The truth is that there are as many numbers of drawbacks of this discrimination as there are the numbers of benefits.
To begin with, co-education serves students’ purpose more than keeping them in separate classes. It is true in some cases that educatees get better results in single-sex classes. But the prime focus should be on the overall development of a student. It is about enhancing one’s personality by co-education. In the real world one does not compete only with candidates of his own sex but everybody. Hence, they ought to be kept in the same class so that they are to work on their skills to match up to the level of the other sex. In this way, they would simultaneously excel in all the fields. In addition, they would be lot more social and understand the people irrespective of their gender.
Some people, however, plead for separate classrooms due to boys are intimidated by girls. They claim that if you have a very bright, very driven, much focused, very articulated lady, which a lot of girls are, that intimidates a boy in the classroom, particularly boys of average ability. As a result, boys do not put their hand up to answer questions or sometimes they indulge in immature behavior to avoid being shown up. Boys are falling behind as girls are doing better. Boys fear failure just like girls do. It is worthy to mention it here that a new study by the three university of Pennsylvania researchers looked at single-sex education in Seoul, Korea. In Seoul, until 2009, students were randomly assigned to single-sex education and co-education. After controlling for other variables such as teacher quality, student-teacher ratio, and the proportion of students receiving lunch support, the study found significant advantages in single-sex education. The students earned higher scores on their college entrance exams and were more likely to attend four-year colleges.
In conclusion, although, there are some advantages with shared schools between boys and girls, separate schools are most beneficial for both students and school authorities. The reason is that boys and girls brains do function in different ways, so they learn very differently. Girls are more passive learners; they are usually good visual and auditory learners and do well with lots of class discussions and diagrams. In contrast, boys are more kinetic learners. So, single-sex class would mean we could cater for different learning styles.

Why paid work is good for children:
Why children should not be engaged in paid work:

Model Answer: 
The question of whether or not children should be involved in some paid job is a very controversial issue. Some people deem it as worthwhile job experience. They claim that this work experience is conducive to a child’s learning and improvement. However, I believe that it would bring harm to the child in several ways.
First of all, a commonly held belief is that children can get useful job experiences from the work ambiance. This might be valid in few cases, yet what type of work they do and the experience they gather are worthless for the future, I think. The children are mostly employed in those sectors that require manual labor, such as cleaning floor, washing dishes, serving foods in the restaurants, and so on. Actually, this type of job’s experience cannot provide the children with that much useful competence so that they can apply it in the future trade.
This leads me to the second point. The advocates of child work argue that it is helpful for learning of the children. The reason is children will get the opportunity to apply what they have learned in practice. I believe there is a sheer chance distracting the children from classroom study. They may become so occupied with the temporal benefit in front of them like small wage, and this may provoke to leave school. Furthermore, most of the workplace is lack of sufficient support for children. Without adequate support, a child’s misunderstanding or improper communicating with adults would only frustrate him and prevent him active learning and interacting with other people.
Finally, it is also argued that it boosts their sense of responsibility. The logic is that they will feel earning money is not an easy task. So, they would spend every penny very carefully. But the reality says a different story. Most of the cases, they become spendthrift, because at this level they are not mature enough that they have sense where to spend and where not.
In conclusion, children paid job experience neither build valuable skills nor impart responsibility. In terms of learning and building responsibility, it is suitable for them to do some volunteer service where they can learn crucial skills used in workplace with enough care and support.

In agreement (Children’s leisure activities must be educational)

In disagreement (Children’s leisure activities must NOT be educational)

 
 
Model Answer :
Today, along with growing interest in child education, attention to the leisure time that how it should be spent also increased. Many feel that kids should engage in educational activities in their leisure hour, if not it would be waste of time. In this essay, it is proved; however, that free time ought to be authentically recreational. It is in this sense that free time means children have already completed their study. Therefore, children should be provided with the activities what they enjoy and that will sharp their average improvement. This will be showed based on two reasons.
In the first place, when it is about children’s overall development, leisure time activities are as crucial as traditional education. Children can develop crucial cognitive and motor skills through play.  For instance, some sports activities like soccer, baseball, basketball, etc. not only teach a skill, but also teach how to work as a team towards a common goal.
Moreover, taking break and having fun is a part and parcel of life, particularly for children. Through the short break between study periods, children can refresh them from stress which ultimately resulting in efficient study. In addition, sports improve fitness and build healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, creative mind will grow while there is no obligation or pressure from others. That is to say, even play with water and sand can be effective to a bright inquiring mind.
To put it in a nutshell, childhood is the sweetest part of life a man have. That is why it would be unwise if we steal their childhood away. Instead, I firmly believe that we should make sure their leisure time what the children really enjoy.

Disagreement with the given statement:

Model Answer :
It is the obvious fact that health, education and commerce are the most crucial matter for the progression of third world countries. The issue of whether or not the developed nations should take more program for assisting the less fortune nations in those sectors has sparked a heated debate. In that case, I contend that obviously wealthy nations should cooperate the poorer nation, but in different ways, such as, ensuring good governance.
Health, education and trade are the key tools for development. But, without good governance, no nation can achieve success in these domains. Most developing nations suffer from widespread corruption in absence of good governance.  These nations simply waste valuable resources in corruption, such as excessive private and public consumption. The corruption cripples the economy and the citizens are deprived of basic needs like health and education. On the top of that, the corruption also creates an adverse situation for trade and commerce. Thus, the lack of good governance impede the progress in health, education and trade.
Now, actually, what we need is to ensure good governance. In order to ride the wave to sustainable development, good governance needs to be focused on governance for meeting the basic needs of the citizens, such as food, shelter, health, primary education, social security. Here the point is how wealthy nations can play an effective role in ensuring good governance in the developing countries. The developed countries can promote good governance through many avenues. They should design a package program, for instance, actively support national processes of democratic transition.
In the process, they ought to provide the developing countries with policy advice and technical support and strengthening the capacity of institutions and individuals. They also can encourage the countries to improve accountability by enhancing transparency in policies. Bangladesh is a good example to be mentioned. In spite of adequate natural resources and industrious manpower, she cannot touch the optimum mark. The sole reason is the considerable lack of good governance. Furthermore, the developed countries always enjoy superior position in establishing trading rules and regulations. So, they should be generous during the negotiation of an international trade. Market access would be the great opportunity for the poorer nations.
In conclusion, the assistance in health or education is good. But when the question is sustainable development, ensuring good governance is the right field where the developed countries could cultivate for better crop.

Some people think that parents should teach children how to be good members of the society. Others, however believe that school is the place to learn this.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer :
Preparing children as a good member of society is very important since its future depends on them. Some people contend that it is the parents’ duty to make them more responsible citizen yet others argue that institution can contributes more than parents in this regard. In my opinion, parents and schools should go hand in hand in order to prepare the youngsters as responsible member of society.
Children are born without any knowledge and social skills, and they keenly look for someone to mimic. Which is why, some people believe that the onus is on the parents to teach children how to be a responsible member of community.  Empirical evidence shows that children behave in the way their father and mother behave. This means that they learn how to behave by following how their parents behave. For example, a child learns respect for others if he or she is treated respectfully by parents, and in the case, the parents should spur all the family members to treat one another with respects. The parents’ role, in fact, is to lay the blueprints for their children behaviour. Children can be sensible member of society in consequence of the parents’ sensible behaviour towards society.
Alternatively, other people subscribe the belief that school is the right institution where children can get the proper guidance to become a sensible member of the community. They argue that the pupil spends at least eight hours a day at school and it is like another society where children can interact with each other. They claim that teachers or mentors have scientific approach to educate learners how to be a good citizen in terms of nation. In addition, they can also learn from their fellow students. Sometimes, there may have some disputes or quarrels between them. It is when the teachers’ responsibility to teach their student how to act at some social situation properly, like how to cooperate with each other to avoid such unexpected situation.
In conclusion, it is obvious that parents and school are not alternative with each other. They are interconnected in such a way that one can be effective through other.

Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement? What other measures do you think might be effective?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Model Answer :
Traffic and pollution are the most pressing issue of city life. Each day, the problem is going from bad to worse with the growing number of private vehicles. That is why, some people contend that the price of fuels should be soared. From my point of view, I do not think it is a sensible idea as it may bring forth devastating consequence in economy. I would rather want government to encourage people to use public transports instead of using private cars.
To commence with, traffic and pollution issues are getting worse and worse. In many circles, it is argued that government should hike the price of fuels up in order to grapple with the issue. They claim that when the price shoots up, people will tend to lessen their use of private vehicles, which in turn will curb the issue. But, the increase in fuels may impact on economy severely. If the price of fuels soars, it will eventually affect each and everything that we use or consume in our daily life. That is to say, the increase in fuel price will raise the transport cost, the rise in transport cost will increase in the price of commodities, which in turn will cause inflation. The increase in fuel price, thus, has dire consequences.
In my opinion, the government should spur people to use public transports rather than increase in fuel price. This is because, it will decrease private cars on the roads, and at the same time the economy will come to no harm. As a result, it will curb the traffic congestion and environmental damages as well.  Apart from that, the government also should try to raise awareness of disastrous consequences of the increasing number of private vehicles so that people are encouraged to change their driving habit.
To reiterate, the increasing traffic and pollution issues are a matter of considerable concern. Some people opine that the price of fuels should be rocketed up, while it could be argued that a price rise may actually increase the risk of damaging economy. It would be good if the government encourages people to use public transport as much as possible.

Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology.
In what ways has technology affected personal relationships? Has this become a positive or negative development?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer : 
Throughout history, man has always served the ways to improve the quality of life. From telegraph to today’s modern cell phone, we have always found the better ways to communicate to each other. A concern has been raised, however, whether or not these technologies are contributing to interpersonal relationships or actually hindering them? The answer is both, I think.
To begin with, the positive aspects of technology are accessibility, networking and communication. Technology makes it easier is first communication. With technology, we have accessibility to connect with people instantly at our fingertips. A very good example here is internet, an amazing tool for communicating. Through the internet, two or more people are able to communicate with each other from entirely different locations in real time. The benefits of this technology include instant communication with family members in abroad, online business meetings, online shopping and so on.
However, on the flip side, there are negative impacts as well, like distraction, health issue and technology dependence. As I have already said that now we are able to communicate whenever we want wherever we stay. Ironically, by being connected, we are also disconnected. Our social behaviors have taken a toll since we decided to place a screen in the middle of our interactions. While busy on our devices, the world gets our divided attention. It is where face-to-face communication is interrupted the moment we turn our attention to a cell phone screen. Furthermore, we start our day by checking emails, skimming the latest headlines, and then posting something ambiguous. Then, we spend the rest of our day texting, tweeting, facebooking, browsing, and sharing. These habits clearly manifest the technological dependence resulting in addiction.
To recapitulate, reality does not permit us to go back to the way we communicated fifty years ago. There were some inconveniences in communication back then that our technological advances have solved. Like any useful tool, to make technology serve us well requires the exercise of good judgment, is all we need.

Reasons why families are not as close as they used to be: 
Model Answer:
Family is the core institution that glues a group of people together. But today, it seems that families are not as intimate as they were before. That is why, now it becomes the demand of time that we unveil the reasons lie in this unfortunate trend and explore the pragmatic solutions. In my point of view, multifaceted causes are liable for this fate, though there are always have remedies.
First of all, life becomes more complicated. The living standard and its cost have soared significantly. People have no option but increase their income to have better lifestyle. Consequently, they are extremely occupied in earning their daily breads. Even most of the cases, they have not any opportunity for spending their spare time with family members. Secondly, there is a tendency of feeling independent. That is to say, very often people think that they are able to handle all the things. They can fix their problem on their own way. Even when they fail to solve their problem, they lean on their friends instead of their families. As a result, there is less sharing among the family members.
The above discussed problems’ solution can be made through two ways. One effective solution can be organizing get together party and picnic with family. This would bring a change in the daily hectic schedule and at the time it also a fantastic opportunity for personal interaction which results in good family tie.  In addition, parents should be lenient and give space for their children to be more expressive. This will impart a strong bond between parents and children. This attitude leads the children to change their mind-set on who to turn to when troubled.
In conclusion, all I want to say that is we should make every effort that ensures a healthy and harmonious family relationship so that we can lead a better sound life. For that, if we employ the steps above outlined will reunite family members, I firmly believe.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?

You should write at least 250 words.
Model Answer:
Traditional skills and way of life are being fading away with the phenomenal development of technology. Some people consider the conventional competencies and lifestyle as worthless, therefore, it does not need to be preserved. In my opinion, I completely disagree with the idea that they fail to take into account how the extinction of the skills and way of life cause the disastrous affects in terms of knowledge and wisdom for the present and future generations.
Traditional skills and ways of life is very handy in order to grapple with natural calamity is the harsh reality in the current era. For example, indigenous people acquire immense skills, and knowledge and wisdom of their environments, based on centuries of living intimate to nature. Remaining close to nature, they have a comprehensive knowledge of properties of plants and animals, the complex rules of ecosystems, and the techniques for utilizing and managing them in a eco-friendly way. So, modern solution and technology could be invented from the tradition skills and way of life practiced by indigenous people.
Likewise, the traditional way of life can save the planet from environmental pollution. Every day, modern lifestyle is deteriorating environment by exploiting the natural resources. Modern man cannot form intimate relationship with nature. In contrast, indigenous people are the priest of nature. They conceive of nature as a living personality; according their belief, a divine spirit pervades all the objects of nature. That is why, they never want to harm or exploit the nature for quenching the lust for life. Apart from that, indigenous people have attained immense knowledge of herbs. For centuries, indigenous people have been using herbs to heal their body. For example, Native Americans have been using an important herb named Sage that heals multiple problems of kidneys, lungs, stomach, skin, liver, and many more. Therefore, many sophisticated medicines could be invented with the help of indigenous people’s knowledge of herbs.
From what has been discussed above, it could be argued that traditional skills and way of life are precious resource for mankind rather than worthless. Therefore, we should preserve traditional skills and way of life as much as possible.

What causes the increased weight of people in many countries?
Measures that could be taken to tackle the overweight issue:

Model Answer :
Almost a third of the world is now fat, and no country has been able to curb obesity, according to new global analysis. In this essay, I am going to unveil some contributing factors result in this problem as well as corresponding remedies which could be taken to cure this issue.
Many studies have shown that lack of access to quality food contributes to obesity. Take America as an example is here. Two-third of U.S. adults is now overweight and one-third are obese, making normal-sized people actual minority. People, in poor neighborhood of America, are confined to unhealthy food environment. Residents of these areas are surrounded by junk food heavens like McDonald, KFC, Subway, and so forth. People have no option but eat rich food. Almost every American is struggling every day navigating the food system in which everything seems to make them overweight and obese.
Now, in order to grapple with the obesity issue, government and individuals should take some measures. The government ought to subsidise fruits and vegetables and should impose tax on junk foods so that people can afford healthy foods and are discouraged to eat unhealthy foods. In addition, the tax money should be spent on raising the awareness of the hazardous effects of junk foods. Likewise, individuals should change their food habit. They ought to cook and grill more frequently at home with healthy food items. For example, many studies show that people are less likely obese with home-made meals than those who eat junk foods of restaurants. So, changing the current food habit will curb the obesity and ameliorate the level of health and fitness.
All in all, I want to say that if we do not consider this as really serious urgent national priority, we are all of us individually and as nation going to pay really serious price. What type of nation can live without a workforce that is healthy? So, what the obese or the obesity is doing to the nation is crippling the workforce, beyond that crippling the families, crippling the individual, and the community. Therefore, the government and individuals should make efforts in tandem so that obesity could be conquered entirely.

Disagreement:

Model Answer: 
After every four years, the world experiences several international sporting events like the FIFA World Cup or Olympics in which different nations participate to show their best performance. Some people argue that these events play an important role in pacifying the international stresses and evoking patriotic feelings among the individuals, while others believe that those events actually fuel the further disputes. From my way of thinking, these events cause vulgar nationalism that worsens international harmony.
Popular international sports events, like FIFA World Cup or Olympics, exhilarate intense patriotic emotion and people, very often, are maddened with the intense emotion. As a result, the playground may turn into a battlefield and the international relationship among the nations gets worse rather than better. On the top of that, the media of the respective nations wage a campaign of deep hatred. Consequently, these events, in fact, fuel vulgar nationalism and people may become angry to the point of erupting into violence. A very good example here is a World Cup qualifying match in 1969. The match between El Salvador and Honduras caused a terrible war that took hundreds of lives, thousands of people were wounded and maimed, and hundreds of thousands of people were made homeless. Thus, these popular may turn into bitter experience ruining international relationship.
Besides, patriotism, in common parlance, is the love for the country. International sport festivals can be a tool for sticking the people of the same nation altogether but for the time being. The abrupt feelings are faded away soon after the finishing of the match. As far as I believe that a true emotion for the country lies in the awareness of the people. The people of the country should be constituted as a political community, only then, there may exist a sustainable emotions for the country. And the international sports festivals can only entice vulgar nationalism rather than patriotism.
All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume that international sports competitions are unable to calm international tension. In reality, these occasions bring forth vulgar nationalism, which in turn leads to conflict, even armed strife among nations.

Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?
You should write at least 250 words.
Use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and with relevant evidence.
Model Answer:
Hundreds of thousands of people are going through pandemic poverty in the developing countries. Some people opine that wealthy nations should lend their support by sharing resource, such as food and education.  Others, on the other hand, argue that the onus is on the governments to provide their citizens with fundamental needs. Although this is a very complicated and controversial issue, I firmly believe that the governments of the developing nations are the right agent in the case.
For a start, the root cause of why people are deprived of basic needs, like food and education, is the lack of good governance. And in absence of good governance, the governments eventually become corrupted. These corruption-ridden governments exploit resources for their own interest instead of people, and eventually, they fail to provide their citizen with the basic needs. In the case, affluent nations’ help does not knock the doors of the deprived people, if there is lack of good governance. So, it is the governments which only can ensure the fundamental needs like food and education for their people.
Besides, many empirical evidences shed light on that that wealthy nations are unable to sustainably develop the poor nations and reveal that if the governments are efficient and good governance prevails, then the people are able to elevate their living standard by managing fundamental needs.  For example, Nicaragua and Vietnam had been suffered of long period of conflict and both were helped with foreign aid. But Vietnam is able to conquer poverty ensuring fundamental needs to its people, whereas Nicaragua still is struggling with the ailing economy.
From the above discussion, it is obvious that foreign aid is a tool with only a limited ability to trigger growth without good governance. Therefore, the governments of the poor countries should practice good governance for ensuring basic needs.
Essay Organisation: 
Theme: Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations or such poor countries should look after themselves?
Point 1: Development is something largely determined by poorer nations themselves.

Why unpaid community serviced should be a compulsory part of high school programmes:
 
Why unpaid community serviced should NOT be a compulsory part of high school programmes:

 
 
Sample Answer:
Co-curricular activities, like volunteer community service, make pupil prepared for the future practically. Normal curricular activity can only help students in their academic theories. But the student who is only experienced with academic curricular may not be able to apply what he or she has learned in practice. Though it is sometimes hard to manage leisure time to volunteer, the boons of voluntary community service are tremendous to individual, individual’s family and individual’s community. In the case, the right pair of time and motivation can help student find friends, reach out to the community and learn new competence and even it can advance the future career. Besides all of these, volunteer community service helps them to form a noble habit from the early age. That is why I think unpaid community service should be integrated into the syllabus at high school level.
First of all, the best part of unpaid community service is that it functions like glue that holds a community together.  Volunteering helps the students to keep in touch with the community and make an excellent atmosphere to live. Even conducting a smallest program can make a real difference to the lives of residents of the community. For instance, charity program to those in need is a very good way helping the poorer neighbour. The volunteering is a two-way street: not only is it blessing for the society, it is also worthwhile for the students. They can boost their interpersonal skills, expand network and make new friends. While some students are easy outgoing and others are introvert and have a hard time meeting the new people. Unpaid community service gives the occasion to exercise and improve social skills, since they are communicating frequently to a group of people with common interest. Teaching sports to the younger children is another good example. Children discern everything you do. By returning back to the society, the volunteer sets forth them firsthand how volunteering makes a difference and how good it feels to help the other.
Similarly, the experience of unpaid social service is invaluable advantage for future career. The volunteering provides an outstanding momentum to practice the crucial skills used in workplace, like communicating, teamwork, problem solving, task management, project planning, and so on. One might sense more comfortable expanding one’s web at work once one have honed this skills in a volunteer position first.
In all in all, I believe human beings have certain objective to accomplish. That is to say, human beings are the representative of God on earth and being the representative of God on earth it is man’s role to look after His creature including human being and other creature as well. And unpaid community service seems to perfect to this role. Therefore, it would be appreciating, if ‘free volunteer service to the society’ is incorporated into the syllabus of high school curriculum.

Do we become used to bad news?

Would it be better if more good news was reported?

 
 
Model answer:
It is often said that the media is the third pillar of democracy. But the question is whether they are really worthy of this high appraisal! Selecting news item is the prerogative of the news editors. They very often decide which news to present to mass people, which to hide from them and they determine the news value. There are certain things that they have to consider. In this respect, readers or viewers are helpless. Unfortunately, most of the cases, they present only saucy news with the view of commercial profit. As a result, we are used to bad news. I think that good news should be published for the sake of the betterment of the society.
Today media houses are being run mostly by the gigantic corporate organizations. A huge number of employees are working there. Furthermore, a quite big deal of budget is allocated for those media houses. Therefore, they are intended to return back their investment as early as possible. To do so, editors often consider news merely as a trade item and they are eager to sell it. Consequently, they are being haunted to the cheap popular news. Moreover, bad events like war, natural calamities and so on are taking place all around the world and naturally those events are making bad news headlines. For instance, after Nine/eleven, the war on terror are running against few countries and particularly, the whole Arab world is involved in war and people are also very much eager to know about this sort of news.
Again, media is so frequently used as a tool to manipulate people. Media houses are trying to build hegemony. Totalitarian dictators use it like propaganda machine. They blurred the people eyes and keep people in a hazy state. Even, they produce justification of war. A case in point is Iraq conflict which shows that how media can be used so shamelessly. Almost every media, whether it is print or electronic, propagated that Saddam Hossain had reserved chemical weapons and they showed this as a justification of war against Iraq. But after the war, no chemical weapon was found and there was no scope to remedy injustice against Iraqi people.
However, negative news affects the level of people’s optimism and happiness. That is to say that people who view the more negative news, the more their optimism level faded away and the more likely they are to feel despair, afraid and tense. In my case, I always manifest good things in my life and great moods through looking at good news and not dwelling on the negative news that are also going on in the world. I feel good every day. For example, TV news that contest with competitors need to broadcast dramatic news story and tell the story as quickly as possible. The medium is good enough at comparing to other media that are giving viewers an emotional attachment to the characters in those news stories. Emotional attachment is something which can be as much about making the viewers happy, making them laughs as it can be about people becoming anxious or pessimist or depressed. Therefore, if we use the strength of television news positively, we can build an optimistic ambiance.
In conclusion, I feel that good and authentic news should be presented. News editors should objectively publish news without manipulating it. But first of all, what we need is to be aware of what is happening around us. No one is here to think for us and it is our responsibility to justify the news and decide which news to perceive. We have to think, we have to judge every incident without any personal bias or prejudice. On the other hand, there are some ethical responsibilities for journalists that they are taught in the schools to disclose the truth, even if it is negative, therefore society can learn from the mistake and take measures toward development. To do so, what we need is to add good news in a good proportion. I see it as similar to a vitamin supplement. It gives us what our media diet does not give us to help balance the daily barrage of negative news. Only then, we can get relief from this worst situation and can go ahead towards a better world.

Present a written argument or case to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic:
The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.
You should write at least 250 words.
Use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.
Model Answer: 
The concept of only one career is fading away day by day. People are now more and more attracted in different professions or means of earning. Basically, there are two main reasons lie in this fact. One cause is huge job scopes due to the ever-changing technology and the other one is socio-economic condition. Consequently, people are eager to learn new things so that they can acquire new skills to adapt with the new condition.
Science & technology opens new avenues in modern life. It has a ripple effect on every aspect of human life. It has changed people’s aura and attitude as well. Not only that, it has revealed manifold job opportunities for human being that was beyond the imagination before. And also due to the technological advancement, people are now able to do various jobs simultaneously.
Nowadays, people are in constant race with the changing technology and education and for the most part they win. The impacts of technological change are enormous. Technology pairs smartly with labour and capital to generate production. For example, it greatly rockets productivity of those who uses the latest computers in their work. Many other inventions have also similar effects. New technologies open new avenues for skilled workers every day. Not only it creates new job scopes but also make people able to work simultaneously in different fields. For instance, a web designer can serve for an organization and coming at home he can also outsource through internet. And in this way he can work at office and home simultaneously and makes an extra income.
Again, life becomes harder day by day.  The overall standard of living and its costs have increased. Sometimes it is really hard to maintain minimum level of standard from single source of income. Moreover, people want to obtain a lot more amenities so that they can lead a cozy life.
The above discussion makes it clear that people have nothing to do but have multiple careers. To do so, people need various skills. Again, technology creates enormous options, but on the flip side it is also ominous for unskilled or outmoded workers. So, further education is direly needed and thus education becomes an indispensable part of human life. In a nutshell, I want to say that we need the latest and diverse knowledge and skills to cope with the latest challenges and we should keep ourselves ready to continue further study whenever it is necessary and accept the opportunity and challenges of having more than one job.
Essay Organisation:
Theme: To have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.
Topic 1: Prospect of huge job facilities due to the ever-changing technology.
Example: Online jobs, Part-time job facilities and stay-at-home job facilities have become common these days.
Example 2: Due to the technological advancement, people are now able to do various jobs simultaneously.
Topic 2: Complex socio-economic condition will force people to work more and in multiple jobs to earn more money.
Example: People’s daily expenses have increased dramatically but their earning has not increased proportionately. Hence working part-time or remotely enables them to earn more.
Topic 3: Further education is required to adapt new technologies or to gain more experience and knowledge.
Example: Without further education someone from Science background can’t adopt in a highly competitive business organization. Similarly with our training or further education someone from Arts or Commerce background can’t compete with people from computer science background.

The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.

Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school.
Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?

Model Answer: 
Babies, toddlers and preschoolers are being enrolled in the foreign language classes by a growing number of parents and the numbers are expected to rise. That means parents now want to be more proactive in jump-starting second language education for their children. At this point, many educators and linguists contend that children will be more beneficial from second language acquisition in elementary school rather than the high school level. As far as I believe that the earlier a child is introduced to a second language, the greater the chances are that the child will become truly proficient in the language. One thing should be mentioned here that speaking a foreign language boosts cognitive, memory and listening skills.
Linguists suggest that kids should start to learn a second language from an early stage; the earlier, the better. Every child is born with the ability to acquire any language in the world. That is to say that language acquisition is an innate capacity of human being. Caryn Antonini, the creator of Early Lingo (earlylingo.com), expounds that “the older the child gets, certain windows close in terms of language acquisition, but so long as the child learns the language before puberty [age 12 or 13], the child should be able to speak with a native accent”.
Again, there are many cognitive benefits of learning a foreign language at an early age. Children who learn a second language at an early age show higher performance in overall basic skills in primary school. They also exhibit better problem-solving skills, enhanced spatial relations, and heightened creativity. According to College Entrance Examination Board, candidates who learn a second language score higher on SATs. So, learning a foreign language early on boosts flexible thinking and communication skills, helping children consider issues from more than one perspective.
To sum up, some parents concern that beginning their children on a foreign language will interfere with the developing mother tongue skills, the opposite is actually true. Learning a second language at a young age is the right thing to do and it also enhances overall essential competence which provides a competitive advantage in the later part of life. Certainly, the benefits of studying a second language at an elementary level go beyond the disadvantages.

Every year several languages die out. Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.
Sample Answer: 
One language goes extinct on average every two weeks, more frequently than bird-species extinction.  Some people contend that it is more convenient to have fewer languages today. I think this argument fails to take into account the damage and devastation it can cause in civilization or mankind.
Language is the utmost important tool for people to communicate in daily life, but it at the same is about more than word. Language is the repository of culture, history, and heritage. Trough the language, each civilization demonstrates a specific way of thinking. For instance, in Tuvan culture, the Tuvan word “ Khojozeeri” intends a particular process of killing a sheep. To ensure a less painful death of the sheep, Tuvans tear one of its cardinal arteries with their fingers. Not only that, through the process, Tuvans consumes the entire sheep: they harvest the hide, meat and viscera, every part of the animal is made sure to utilize. The idea “Khojozeeri” deals with is needed three sentences to describe. It does not just mean slaughter but also humaneness and kindness. Moreover, it also shows the values of Tuvan society. From this view, “Khojozeeri” is untranslatable. Moreover, it tells non-Tuvans something distinct and worthy about the Tuvan way of life. So, language is not merely a tool for communicating, it also encapsulates custom, tradition and values of a society.
In my opinion, I believe that languages contain the intellectual wisdom of the communities. Many indigenous tribes’ tongues are the vast repository of knowledge and wisdom as they attain the knowledge and wisdom by the way of life based on centuries of living close to nature. The indigenous communities’ knowledge is transmitted from generation to generation by oral language or culture. Take the Kallawaya people in South America for an example. They have been using a mysterious language passed from generation to generation for more than 400 years. The key feature of the language is the names and uses of medicinal plants that could be precious resource to modern medical science. So, if the language of any indigenous tribe is extinct, we may suffer the loss of the priceless resource.
To conclude, I infer that it is a catastrophic for the future of mankind. It causes the irrecoverable loss of knowledge and wisdom. So, all the endangered languages should be preserved, since languages are not merely words but something more than that.

Some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities. Others, however, say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.
Idea Generation for this essay:
Why increased number of sports facilities are best for improving the public health?
Why sports facilities would have little effect on public health?

Alternative measures that are required to improve public health:
Model Answer :
Health is a resource of everyday life, not the objective or luxury of living. It depends on various factors, such as body weight management, proper nutrition, avoiding alcohol abuse, abstaining from drug abuse, hygiene and getting the right amount of sleep. Some people think that a good number of sports facilities can ameliorate public health. Since it leans upon several conditions, a combined program is needed to progress public health, in my opinion.
Ensuring sports facilities to citizen is a good idea but inadequate to develop public health. Firstly, the use of sports facilities is limited by time, season and location. Therefore, all people cannot get benefit of it, particularly working people who work from 9 to 5. Moreover, the present life style is very busy and complicated, that means, there is severe paucity of time. So people cannot dedicate time to sports activities. Consequently, only a few numbers of people utilizes facilities at sport centers to keep fit and the significant number of mass remains out of it. Secondly, having facilities does not ensure always that people will make good use of what is offered to them. In most cases, it depends on individual choice and healthy life style.
On the other hand, public health can be improved by developing all health-related components of lifestyle, for instance, environment, education, habit and so on. Environment is the vital issue in terms of public health. Take water pollution for an example: it causes severe diseases like diarrhea. Likewise, air pollution causes sinusitis. So, to improve public health, we need some effective measures for protecting and maintaining healthy atmosphere. Not only pollution but food habit is also crucial. The habit of junk food causes obesity, for example. Above all, the substantial issue to improve public health is knowledge and awareness of a hygienic lifestyle. People need to be taught about the hazard of an unhealthy lifestyle, just as they need to be appreciated to lead a healthy lifestyle. This can be achieved by aiming at children and teaching them good health ethics so that they can follow it throughout their lives.
In short, I just want to say that no single effort has complete meaning alone. To improve public health, we need a set of programs so that it can cover every aspect of public health and that should include the sports facilities as well.

What things will computers be used in the future?

Why the dependency on computers is a good thing?
Why the dependency on computers is a bad thing?
Model Answer:
Computers today are performed in virtually every aspect of the most individuals’ lives. In business, computers are used extensively, such as, to maintain sales record, customer records, manage inventories, and maintain online stores, controls robots and other machines in factories. Computers pair neatly human efforts and machine to enhance productivity. In the war, it is used in accurate target and to reduce maximum casualties.
In the near future, computer will determine our every step. But the question is how computers will impact on our lives, attitude or mindset and our overall environment. Future computers will change the uses of electronic devices at workplace and home. Take TV for an example. Without remote control, your TV will be able to pause the program you are watching just seeing you are leaving the room. There might other applications consist of a set of software that will help people control their computers and other connecting devices at workplace or home with just gesture.
The advancement of computer technology has made our life easier and the overall productivity has enhanced to a great extent. We should not stay back while we can make the world a better place with the help of this technology. Everywhere, including home, office, bank, research centre and business, computer is a must for advancement. So we don’t have any other option rather than embracing the miracle of this tool.
We need to be more cautious than suspicious while using computers. If anything goes wrong with the computers, that would because of our faults, the technology could not be blamed. So being suspicious and not welcoming this gift would be an imprudent idea. Rather we should be more careful to use this technology in sophisticated areas like controlling traffic, diagnosing a patient or controlling airplane to reduce any disaster.
From what has been discussed above I can draw the conclusion that no one in this life can avoid computer whether at present or tomorrow. But what we should be aware of is that computer errors. A single silly mistake might turn into nightmare for us and even can bring down devastating outgrowth.

There are many different types of music in the world today. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the International music that is heard everywhere nowadays?
You should write at least 250 words.
Use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.
Sample Answer :
Music is deluged with feelings in which sound or cadence is merely a vehicle. Yet, only the sound is apparent. Music becomes meaningful when it touches the emotions, depression, inspirations of a listener. It plays a vital role in human life. Music includes lots of genres at present. Accordingly, it is hard to reach at the point that whether conventional music of a country is superior to international music, or not. In the most cases, it is subject to individual predilection. In that respect, I firmly believe that traditional music deserve more importance than international music.
Music has a great significance in human life. We are living in an aura of music. That is to say, every object of nature has its own music: the sounds of the waves of ocean, the voice of waterfall, the chirping of birds that keep the nature vivacious. Music pervades all the objects of nature as a divine spirit. I believe that the company of music gives joy to the human heart. It ignites the emotions of men. Let me give you an example, when we hear country song it is nothing but sharps our patriotism. Likewise, music has a healing influence on sorrow-stricken hearts. You can regard it as a moral teacher, as a nurse of man, and as an elevating influence. I believe that between man and music there is mutual consciousness, spiritual communion or mystic intercourse.
From the above discussion, it is clear that music is an imperative part of human life. However, there is dispute that between traditional music and international music which one is more crucial. In my point of view, national music performs a significant role for a nation. The reason for this is traditional music bears the history and heritage of a nation which constitute culture. And many societies, particularly the indigenous people, deem culture as their archetypal manifestation, without which they have no roots. That is to say, every one of thousands of cultures has music that is distinctive and salient facet of its identity. Although it is true that international music is prevalent everywhere these days, but it would be wrong to claim that it has real value except commercial. Usually, most of them are fail to communicate psychologically or spiritually. It just brings temporal liking.
In conclusion, music is the indispensable segment of human life. The role of music in life is undeniable. It would be unwise to patronize the international music at the cost of local music. We have to protect traditional music for our own sake.

Being a celebrity – such as a famous film star or sports personality- brings problems as well as benefits. Do you think that being a celebrity brings more benefits or more problems?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Idea Generation for this essay:
Benefits of being a celebrity / Advantages enjoyed by a celebrity:
Disadvantages of being celebrity:

 
Model Answer:
Almost every one of us dreams about being renowned and popular, like a famous superstar or sports figure. The general apprehension is that they have all a man should have in life. When they are on the red carpet they look like they do not have difficulties and their lives seem to fit perfect. It appears that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Everything has its price. The truth is that there are as many drawbacks or downsides of being a luminary as there are the number of advantages.
First of all, celebrities are comparatively affluent than the average Joe. A celebrity can earn a lot of money, which itself is a great boon. They can afford luxurious homes and cars, fancy gifts and gorgeous cloths, some feel fortunate enough to share their wealth with the less fortunate. A good example here is Madonna, the American pop icon. She founded Raising Malawi, a non-profit organization that supports community-based organizations that provide vulnerable children and caregivers with nutritious food, proper clothing, and formal education and so on. Secondly, many opportunities arise when a person becomes famous. Whatever they do in the film industry they get a bunch of opportunities, like an ambassador or spokesperson for brands. Take people like Genesis Rodriguez made her red carpet debut as a new ambassador for L’Oreal Paris USA at the recent 15th Annual Latin Grammy Awards in Las Vegas. In addition, many celebrities are becoming business tycoon after and while they have stardom. And last but not least, very often celebrities belong a position about which a lay man can never think of. Just think of Angelina Jolie, she has achieved a fame which an ordinary woman can never touch the boundary. Though, both belong to the same gender, the acceptance makes an obvious difference.
On the flip side, the celebrities have no privacy in the most cases. If Demi Moor and her beau go for a long drive, the whole world will about it. Lack of privacy is one of the biggest handicaps of being a celebrity. Similarly, they are being judged constantly on their personality, habit and a lot more. Reading rude, insulting, derogatory, nasty and lies about one’s own self is a part and parcel of a famous film star’s daily routine. Imagine how embarrassing it would be if a tabloid published your hidden affair. Furthermore, a famous person cannot do things that an ordinary person can easily. They live in their secluded world. Even they cannot go for shopping to the super market, take a walk, chilling with friends at the park or having dinner with family at the local restaurant.
In brief, being famous has both bad and good sides. Despite of negative sides, I firmly believe that fame and fortune are the matchless factors in the life of a celebrity. Being a celebrity is endowed with more advantages compared to its difficulties.
