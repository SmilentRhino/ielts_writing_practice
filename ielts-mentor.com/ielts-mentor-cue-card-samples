**Possible Answer 1:**  
I like visiting famous places and whenever I get vacation, I try to visit new
places or places that I have heard about. One such trip that I took with one
of my friends was a journey to Holland. I would like to talk about this tour
to Holland that we took 2 years age.

Both of us (_me and my friend_) wanted to visit Holland and specifically
Amsterdam, Hague and Rotterdam very much because we saw pictures and heard
stories from friends about how beautiful and wonderful the place is. So
finally we applied for visa, bought plane tickets, booked a hotel, packed our
bags and our trip began.

We spent a lot of time before our holiday, researching of all the interesting
places to visit and all the sights to see. So we went to Rijks museum, Van
Gogh museum, Amstell Beer museum, took a romantic sunset cruise in the water
channels, drove to Volendam, a small prettiest fisherman village, visited a
cheese farm. We went to Rotterdam, which is the architecture city of Holland
that stimulates innovation. We enjoyed the architectures and building there as
much as we did walking in the neat roads and besides the beaches. Visiting the
famous Anne Frank house was an exciting moment for me. I've read the Anne
Frank's Diary in my early childhood and witnessing the place was very much
exciting.  
  
Every evening we took long walks along the channels, resting in small gardens,
which Amsterdam has a lot of. Street artists were performing everywhere and a
lot of people came to watch their show.

We enjoyed very much everything we did and especially in such a beautiful
country. Having my friend by my side on this trip made it even more fun. Since
we have never been to Holland, everything we saw and did seemed interesting
and completely new to us. The people, their way to interpretation their
culture attracted us very much. Before leaving the place, both of us agreed
that the place is worth visiting and someday we would come back to re-explore
it.

**Possible Answer 2:**  
Once I was reading an article when I came across the lines of Rabindranath
Tagore highlighting the beauty of Taj Mahal. It stated, “The Taj Mahal rises
above the banks of the river like a solitary tear suspended on the cheek of
time.” The lines encouraged me to visit the monument of love, The Taj Mahal.

Taj Mahal is included in the Seven Wonders of the World. So, before even I
think of visiting any other site, it becomes more of a responsibility to give
a visit to the heritage site of India. It was the prime reason I visited Taj
Mahal.

It was a short trip with my family. My parents and my brother accompanied on
my trip. It was a fun-filled trip as after a long time I got an opportunity to
spend time with my family. Moreover, we opted for a road trip so that we had
the flexibility to visit other famous places in Agra.  It is rightly said,
that journey matters, and not the destination, and this is what I experienced
during my short-trip.

###  Tips for answering this Cue card question:

You are free to talk about any journey you are comfortable to talk about. It
can be journey to another city of your country, to a historic or tourist
place, a foreign country or to a relative or friend's house to a different
location. While talking about this cue card, take some notes about a journey
you remember particularly where you went, what was the purpose of going there,
how you travelled there, what you saw on your way and at the place, what you
did, how long you stayed, whom you met there, who you went there with.

If you liked the journey tell about some exciting things you watched and did
there than the usual things you do. For instance: you can mention some of the
great places you visited there, the sightseeing of the journey. Do not focus
too much on the place you went rather emphasize what happened on the way. This
cue card is bit different that **'Describe a place you have visited'** where
you would mostly describe things you watched and did on the place but for this
cue card you should mostly tell about your experience during the journey.

**Some key points to mention for this cue card:**

  * You had a plan to visit this place for a long time and when you had the journey, you had been excited about the whole thing.
  * You would meet a friend or relative after a long and that made you feel good.
  * You have some memories related to this place and visiting there was a good experience for you.
  * If this is a foreign country, say that you had a longing to visit this country.
  * The weather was comfortable and there was no interruption on the way.
  * You had friends with you and you enjoyed their company as well as the vehicles.
  * This was not a typical journey that you usually take.
  * The natural beauty surrounding the roads was charming.
  * You observed some different custom and culture there.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. What are the importance of traveling?  
**Answer:** **That's an interesting and important question actually. Firstly, travelling enables people to meet new people, gather first hand experience and have new experiences that could otherwise have been impossible. Secondly, knowledge about culture, history and overall civilization is enhanced by travelling and by making new acquaintances people can swap opinions and values, let go of false beliefs and become more broad-minded and less regressive. Lastly, travelling cultivates tolerance and understanding, breaks the barriers of mind, removes the existing prejudices and results in positive changes in attitudes by reminding everyone that we are all the same and we should treat each other with respect and compassion. 

**Q. What type of places do you recommend people to visit on vacation?  
**Answer:** **As far as I'm concerned, for summer vacation I would definitely suggest that people go to maritime areas, so that they can relax, swim, enjoy their free time and recharge their refreshing batteries. In other seasons, of course it depends on people's personality, but I would recommend hillbilly areas. In spring, for example, going to a place and enjoying the nature is a very good outlet and helps people relax and oxygenate their brain. Furthermore, in winter, areas with mountains and hills are the best options and they can even go skiing and climbing. As mentioned, it is a matter of character and preference, but from my point of view the above suggestions would make everyone enjoy the vacation. 

**Q. What places do you want to visit in future? Why?  
**Answer:** ** I want to travel around the world and visit many countries, but since I was a child I have been dreaming to visit America one day. I used to and still do watch American TV series and movies and I really like different things there. For example, I always wanted to see the Statue of Liberty and go to the Brooklyn Bridge. I adore the way people live in that country and the architecture of different houses as well, especially those in the suburbs. Of course New York, the city that never sleeps, is my main aim, but I would also like to investigate other cities and places. To conclude, I would visit many museums and historic places as well as the White House in the United States. I would also like to see the seven modern wonders of the world.    
  
__Tip:__ America is my personal preference and I have mentioned  some of the
reasons why I would like to go there. You can mention the same country and add
some other details or you can say about other countries. You can also mention
a destination in your own country that you have never been to. Just justify
your choice.

[Part 3 answers are written by - **Mary, UK, **Economist with Main Field of
Studies in Business Economics]

**If you plan to say that you did not enjoy the journey focus on the following points:**

  * You did not intend to go there but you had no other choice.
  * The weather was not good and that made the journey difficult.
  * You did not like the vehicles that you took for the journey.
  * It took a very long time which was tiresome.
  * You got sick during the journey.
  * There was no interesting thing to do or watch.
  * The vehicle was a public transport and stopped several times.

###  Necessary vocabulary for this cue card:

To arrive, departure, delay, destination, tour guide, map, to visit,
reservation, sightseeing, business trip, book, accommodation, backpacking,
Appropriate Clothing, currency, money exchange, Security Checkpoint, landing.

###  Did you know?

**Journey:** A journey refers to the distance we travel from a particular place to another one. A journey could be a long journey in which we travel a really long distance while a short journey refers to our travelling from one place to another one and distance is short. When you visit a relative’s house in another city, this can be a journey.  You journey to your office or university every day. This is a short and regular journey. 

**Travel:** Travel means going from one to another place. We travel to local museum, travel to another city country or even to another country. 

**Trip: **Trip usually refers to a short journey to a place for a certain purpose. The purpose could be for personal, business or pleasure. People go to a trip to visit a historic place, to enjoy a special occasion like marriage anniversary in a different city, take boat trip in the evening or go to a business trip to attend a conference.   

**Tour: **Tours are usually taken during the holidays and it refers to a journey during which people visits and enjoy different places. For instance, the office employees went in a tour and visited different places in Denmark. The whole journey took more than 2 weeks and this whole experience is referred to as Tour. 

**Voyage: **A voyage is a long sea or air journey. People go to a voyage in sea or in space. 



**Some other cue cards that you should be able to answer if you prepare for this cue card:**

**1\. Talk about an interesting journey you took recently.  
2\. Describe a visit to one of your relative's house.  
3\. Describe your journey to your home town.  
4\. Describe a journey you took to a foreign city.  
5\. Talk about a journey you disliked.  
6\. Describe a journey you remember.  
7\. Describe one of your memorable journeys. **  


**Follow up Questions:**

**• What are the importances of traveling?**  
**Answer: **There are many important elements associated with traveling. It plays a vital role in developing a person’s character. It helps an individual to break the barriers of mind and become open minded. The closed bubble gets burst, and people get an opportunity to come outside of their comfort zone. Traveling is the way to escape from the daily chores and get some time for your own self. Sometimes it is really what a person needs to move forward in life. Travelling offers us to learn about various places, people and history and thus it offers us the first hand knowledge. 

**• What type of places do you recommend people to visit on vacation?**  
**Answer:** When I say traveling is about breaking barriers, I would restrict myself from recommending any particular places, as it will act as a barrier in deciding future destination. Even I would like to leave it on time, and would prefer to take every opportunity as and when it comes. However most of the people should have their own preferences for visiting and historic places in my opinion should be on top of the I-want-to-travel list.

**• What places do you want to visit in future? Why?**  
**Answer: **There are so many places in my home country where I have never been to. I would like to explore my country first and then would like to visit the 7 wonders of the world. Apart from that I would like to visit Italy, Switzerland, Australia and Thailand in the future. ** **

place&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a historical place that you know about.

**You should say: **

  * what the place is
  * where it is located
  * what is the historical significance of the place

**and describe your experience of the place.**  
  
**Follow-up Questions:**  
• What do you think of the future trend of historic places?  
• Will government strengthen its protection toward historic places?  
• What are the changes brought about by the historic place in local economy,
people, etc?  
• What is the effect of tourists on the place?

**Model Answer 1: **  
I have a special interest on visiting famous places and on my list historical
places always get preferences. I have visited many historical places like
Machu Picchu in Peru, The Pyramids at Giza, Taj Mahal, Parthenon in Greece and
many more. The historical significance and the site attractions sometimes
mesmerized me. The historical place that I would like to talk about today is
Colosseum (_also known as Coliseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre_)
which is situated in Rome, Italy.   It is basically an elliptical amphitheatre
in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy which is the largest amphitheatre in
the world and is made of concrete and stone. The construction of Colosseum
began under the emperor Vespasian in 70 AD and was completed under Titus in 80
AD.  
  
The Colosseum could hold approximately 50,000 to 80,000 spectators and was
used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles,
animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles etc. The Colosseum
was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980 and was also included
among the New Seven Wonders of the World. It is 189 meters long, and 156
meters wide, with a base area of 6 acres .The height of the outer wall is 48
meters. The Colosseum nowadays is one of the major tourist attractions in Rome
with thousands of tourists each year paying to view the interior arena.  
  
I have heard and seen of this famous place a lot and when I witnessed it for
the first time, I became speechless. The huge architect, the overwhelming
interior and exterior decoration was beyond appreciation. The place kept
reminding me the classical mythological and historical facts I have read and
heard about.

###  IELTS Cue Card Topic: Describe an historical place that you know about.

**Sample Answer 2: **  
I am going to talk about an amazing historical place that I know about, even
though I’ve never visited it.  I’ll tell you what it is, where it is and as
much as I can about the historical meaning of the place and finally my own
reactions/ experiences regarding it.

I want to tell you about Stonehenge.  This is an ancient set of standing
stones, arranged in a circle.  It is located in Wiltshire, in England, but I
think it would be fair to say the image of it would be recognised worldwide,
as it is possibly one of the most famous historic sites in the world.

In terms of the meaning of the place it’s really impossible to say.  It is so
very old, even archaeologists aren’t sure exactly when it was built, estimates
go back to as long ago as 3000 BC, which is mind boggling to me!  It is
certainly accurate to describe it as a prehistoric monument.  Some people
think it might have started as a burial mound and be even more ancient that
5,000 years.  The colossal slabs are arranged like huge door frames, no-one
really knows how they were erected without the technology of modern times, but
everyone agrees it was an incredible feat of engineering and showed foresight
and tenacity in spaces!  However, it is certain that they were somehow aligned
so that at key stages of the lunar (moon) and solar (sun) cycles, the way the
light strikes the stones is of some significance.  Apparently it was
deliberately constructed so that the rising sun only reached the middle of the
stones for just one day of the year.

Lots of people like to try and imagine what sort of ceremonies and importance
the stones might have had for the people who built it, but the truth is we
can’t say.  Even today, modern day druids have for many years gathered at the
stones for the summer solstice (longest day of the year) and winter solstice
(shortest day of the year) to watch the sun rise and mark the event with their
own celebrations.

For me I think this is the ultimate historical place, even though I have yet
to visit it.  It is just so remarkable to think it was constructed all those
thousands of years ago just by physical labour. Even the stones themselves –
the largest of which are up to 30 feet and weigh about 25 tons, had to be
brought to the site from about 20 miles away, how on earth was that possible?
For me the stones prove that with determination, tenacity and working together
it is sometimes possible to achieve what seems impossible.  At the same time,
the way they have endured over time, gives perspective on our place in the
world.  Time passes, people and generations pass too, but they can leave a
legacy behind even if it only one of many unanswered questions for future
people to ponder over!

![Describe a historical place that you know
about](/images/IELTS_cue_card/IELTS_Cue_Card_historical_place_that_you_know_about.jpg)

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

This cue card is different from the cue card 'describe a historic place you
have visited'. For the later one you should pick a historic place which is
usually located in your country and you have visited. In this case you need to
say when you visited and what you enjoyed there. But for the cue card
'describe a historic place that you know about', you can talk about any
historic place located at anywhere in the world. Not necessarily you need to
visit a place to know about it.  
  
Do not pick a place which has very little historic significance or the places
that store historic evidences but not itself is a historic place. For
instance, you can learn a lot about history from museum but the museum is not
a historic place.  
  
A historic place can be part of national history or international history. For
instance, some places in your country may be the part of the history of your
country but not known in world history. In your IELTS you can pick such
nationally recognized historic places.  
  
There is a subtle difference between a famous place and the historic place. To
be a historic place, the place itself has to be qualified and registered for
the historic place.  
Don't pick a broad area or a whole city as a historic place, rather pick the
particular place. Like, there are lots of historic places in Rome like:
Colosseum, The Pantheon, St Peter's Basilica etc. and if you pick Rome as the
historic place, you won't be able to cover all the historic significance of
this city. Alternatively, picking only Colosseum or The Pantheon would give
you a better option to describe it.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. What do you think of the future trend of historic places?**  
**Answer:** This is a really controversial issue. There are many people who believe that historic places should be preserved because they are the depiction of a country's overall civilization. These places constitute an integral part of a nation's history, culture and heritage. On the other hand, opponents of this trend argue that places with historical significance should be demolished and replaced by something modern that will meet nowaday's needs and demands, such as supermarkets, cinemas, theatres, and so on. Personally, I strongly oppose the latter opinion and I totally believe that historic places must be retained either for usage, if possible, or for posterity. The future is uncertain and depends, many times, on the decision of political leaders and the powerful people. However, I believe that historical places in future would become more important and would be preserved more carefully. More tourists would be interested to visit such places and they would be one of the main attraction among foreign tourists. 

**_Tip: _**A good way to fully answer the question is to say something general about historic places and then justify your opinion. For example, you could say that you want them be preserved or not. Give examples to put more articulation. 

**Q. Will government strengthen its protection toward historic places?**  
**Answer:** I can't really know for sure, but I would say that these places must be protected no matter what. As mentioned, historic places reflect a country's history, culture and civilization and they are a nation's brand. To illustrate, Greek authorities make significant efforts to preserve and renovate the structure of the Acropolis and every year they perform programmes for the restoration of the Hill. They also work to make different monuments approachable by the tourists and also maintain their initial identity. 

**Q. What are the changes brought about by the historic place in local economy, people, etc?**  
**Answer:** When I think of changes brought by the historic places, the first thing that comes to my mind is 'benefits'. Firstly, these places provide employment and income to many people, not only in some particular seasons with many tourists, but also throughout the year. In addition, as these places are famous and a country is characterized by those, locals and foreign visitors will pay them a visit and this results in gaining popularity of a country. Furthermore, as a result of these visits, the whole economy will develop and these countries will flourish and prosper. People would learn diverse cultural aspects and would be able to present their own cultures and custom to the visitors. 

**Q. What is the effect of tourists on the place?**  
**Answer:** Visits from people of other countries to these places might lead to both positive and negative consequences. The most important thing is that a place will become really popular and prestigious and will attract more visitors every year. Through the internet and  social media, those tourists will share photos and videos of their activities and their friends will learn about those places. The visiting tourists bring many foreign cultures and customs which are often unknown to the local people. The increasing tourists often increase the business opportunity in the local area. 

Apart from the beneficial aspects, there are some negative implications as
well. As these places are very crowded with the tremendous number of visitors,
they become dirty because everyone throws their rubbish wherever they want and
this is unhygienic and if the trash aren't cleaned immediately, a place like
this will become smelly. Local people learn foreign customs and culture which
often threaten the local culture.

[The part three answers are written by **Mary, UK**]

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a party that you have attended.

  * what party it was
  * where the party was held
  * who attended the party

**and describe what you did in that party.**  
  
**Follow-up Questions:**  
• What are the differences between serious party and friendly party?  
• Why are some people late for parties intentionally?  
• Why do some people like party while others hate it?  
• What would you do if the guests feel bored?  
• Will there be more and more people to attend parties?

**Possible Answer 1:**  
Today I’m going to tell you about a particular party I went to earlier in the
year, I’ll tell you where it was, and who went and what I got up to whilst I
was there!

In honesty I can be a bit grumpy about going to parties!  I never know what to
wear as I don’t really like dressing up.  I feel self-conscious in dresses and
too much of a scruff if I don’t make an effort.  I worry about whether I’ll
know anyone, and I dread sit-down meals because I’m a vegetarian and I always
seem to be a problem.  This being so, when a close friend of mine announced
she would have a big celebration for her fiftieth birthday, my heart sank a
bit.  Of course I put on a smile, and said ‘that’s great!’ but I wasn’t really
looking forward to it.   I knew that it was important to her though, so I was
determined to make a real effort, and of course I agreed I would go.

Well, I should have had more faith.  The party was great.  It was held in a
beautifully converted barn in a rural location on the edges of Sheffield in
England.  The venue had a wooden polished floor, and was very simply decorated
with some tastefully positioned fairy lights and candles.  The candles were in
fact artificial for safety reasons, but they looked very realistic.  There was
low-level music playing and lots of places to sit and chat or mingle with
other guests.  If I remember correctly, there were white table cloths over the
tables and some simple but lovely floral decorations.  Food was provided by a
friend of the Birthday Girl, who specialises in fast street food.  You could
queue up for a delicious meal presented in a wrap from a very jolly woman
serving from an open-sided vehicle parked in the cobbled courtyard outside.
In a separate annexed room inside was a table almost collapsing under the
weight of delicious home-made cakes and puddings on one side, and glorious
British cheeses on the other.  There was also a small bar serving drinks, for
which my host picked up the bill at the end, it was really beautifully done –
very tasteful, calm and joyful too.

My friend, whose birthday it was, has a really wide network of friends.  She
decided to invite anyone and everyone from her social circle.  So there were
old school friends; people she knew from her voluntary activities with scouts;
fellow runners – she is very active in a number of running clubs.  Former work
colleagues; people she’d come to know just from waiting with other parents at
the school gates when her children were little; fellow entrepreneurs (she runs
her own small business) as well as neighbours and acquaintances from every
area of her life.

Before I went I was worried about whether I’d know anyone else there.  I
hadn’t been living in the area for all that long before being invited, and so
I was a bit hesitant about what to expect.  I should have remembered what a
good judge of character my fantastically friendly friend is!  What did I do at
the party?  Apart from eating my body weight in delicious food… I met and
talked to many interesting people that I might otherwise never have come
across!  This included the self-employed interior designer; marathon runners;
a former Bluebell girl (that’s a famous Parisian dance troupe); artists;
writers; an organ transplant co-ordinator; medical doctors; IT workers;
academics and students.  It was a remarkable cross section of fascinating
folk.  I had a really wonderful time.

What’s more, I discovered that actually I did know quite a few people there
after all.  It was great fun trying to discover how we all came to be there
and what connected each of us to the –‘hostess with the mostest’ to coin the
old phrase!  I am almost won over.  Next time she offers to host a party, I
might even find myself looking forward to it, you never know.

**Possible Answer 2:**  
The party I'd like to describe is the New Year eve party that I attended 2
years back. Our University friends invited me to join the party and I had to
contribute some amount for that. The party held on a 3 star hotel where the
teachers, students and their relatives attended.

On the New Year eve one of my friends gave me a call and then I picked up a
taxi to reach the hotel. The name of the hotel was (.._say a name you
prefer_...) and it was a beautiful hotel in our city. After I reach the hotel
I found that it has been gorgeously decorated with lights. Our party was in
the 2nd floor and I found most of my friends and some of the teachers already
enjoying the party.

A local music band was singing and people were wearing mostly party dresses.
We enjoyed the party a lot and ate several local and foreign dishes. We
started counting down the time at 11:59 pm and when the clock ticked at 12:00,
we started shouting with the New Year wishes. We stayed at the party till 2.00
am and all those time we enjoyed our time every way possible.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. What are the differences between a serious party and a friendly party?**  
**Answer:** I think that there many differences in these two kinds of party. In the former, the attire is often more elegant with guests wearing costumes and ties, while in the latter this doesn't always happen and they wear more casual clothes, such as jeans, t-shirts and so on. In addition, serious parties are often more of professional type, whilst with friendly parties this isn't always the case. For example, a serious party includes a party with a person's colleagues, employer and boss and in case of the second some peers, fellow students or relatives enjoy the party. Moreover, it could be argued that serious parties are mostly held in restaurants or bars and most of the time are expensive, while friendly parties in houses or cafeterias and are cost-saving. 

**Q. Why are some people late for parties intentionally?**  
**Answer:** This is a really interesting question and to be honest I have never thought about it. I can't find a logical explanation why someone will do something like that and I would describe it as a really immature and unscrupulous action. But, unfortunately there are many who belong to this category and some of them are friends of mine as well. A reason that comes to my mind is that someone doesn't want to go to a party but they are forced to do so. Indeed, there are many occasions and especially related to workplace or parties thrown by relatives where people are sometimes forced to be present. In this case, the only solution is going many hours after the commencement of the party. This is the only reason I can think of and partly justify this action.  
  
_**Tip:**_ If you are one of them just say the reason you are doing this and
give the best explanation you can in order to convince the examiner that your
action is justifiable.

**Q. Why do some people like party while others hate it?**  
**Answer:** I don't really know for sure, but I would say that it's a matter of individual character and preference. There are certain people who are introvert and like to keep a low profile who don't like places and events which are crowded. Furthermore, if parties are held in houses, the mess is unavoidable and oftentimes the damages are irreparable, so for the host it could be said that is a traumatic experience.  
  
Moving to those who love parties, it could be argued that it's a way in which
people come together and have some fun. It's arguably true that due to the
excessive working hours and the busy lifestyle, people have drifted apart and
become alienated. Parties are great opportunities for reunions and substantial
conversations. A further reason which is a little ludicrous is because of the
tasteful and delectable food. I can say about some of my friends that - the
first thing that comes in their mind when they hear that they are invited to
parties is 'food' and they are instantly inundated with positive feelings.

**Q. What would you do if the guests feel bored?**  
**Answer:** The first thing I would do if my guests are bored in a party that I have hosted is turn on the music or change my playlist. There are some people who don't like the conventional and rife types of music and prefer something else. If music couldn't help, I would ask them what they want to do to have fun and adjust to their desires and preferences, if possible. Furthermore, if nothing of the above could produce a positive result and make their mood change, I would play a game to attract their interest or tell some stories from our different experiences and stages of life, which would definitely lead to lots of laughter and joy. I would finally arrange some indoor games and would declare some prizes for the winners to warm up the guests. 

_**Tip: **_Some other options to cheer up the bored guests in a party could
be- changing food and drinks, sugar and coffee sometimes make someone
recharged, introducing each other so that they can talk, giving them space and
autonomy is useful as well, because they are free to do whatever they want
without restrictions.

**Q. Will there be more and more people to attend parties?**  
**Answer:** Yes I think so. I truly believe that the number of party lovers will increase in the future. The opportunities to gather together with friends and relatives are shrinking in modern days and people would not want to miss parties where they can meet people, relatives and enjoy their time. Parties would be a way of relaxing and taking breaks for many busy employees and the increasing number of party attendees these days gives a hints that in the future it will further increase.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a person who accidentally became your friend.

**You should say:**

  * who the person is
  * how  you met him/her
  * what made you two become friends

**and explain how is your friendship now.**

**Follow up Questions:**

  * Which one is better, being introvert or extrovert?
  * What type of person  you are?
  * What important aspects do you consider to make new friends?

**Possible Answer: **  
Though I have many friends, my friendship with them grew up with times and
mutual understanding. But I can recall that my friendship with George grew up
almost all of a sudden.

George is senior to me by 2-3 years and I did not meet him until I was in the
4th semester in my University. One of my term final exam's schedules was
changed and I did not know that. According to my previous exam schedule I
reached my University and was totally confused what to do when I heard that
the exam was already over. I went to our Departmental head's office and he
could not find a way around of it. He blamed me that I should have been more
careful about the changes. I explained him that I was sick and did not come to
university for 3-4 days and that made me unaware of the exam schedule changes.
Then I found that someone who was sitting next to me in the departmental
head's office asked me to meet the course teacher and explain the situation.
He then escorted me to our course teacher's room and talked to the teacher. It
seemed to me that George was already personally known to our teacher and they
had an intimate relationship. Hearing everything the teacher agreed to arrange
an exam for me next day in his office room.

My friendship with George grew up after that event and albeit our age
differences we found that we had many common interests and habits. We started
spending time and I visited his home many times. We worked in a retail shop
for about 6 months and that helped us become more intimate.

George is now staying in USA and we do not meet each other in person. But we
have online communications and we often let each other know our updates.

Tips for answering this cue card topic:

You should talk about a person who became your friend accidentally  for this
cue card. Usually we have friends from our childhood, classes and locality but
this this cue card would be bit different from the topic “**Describe one of
your friends**”. This cue card expects you to talk about a person who became
your friend for a reason and whom you met accidentally i.e. you helped him/
her sometime and later you became friends or can be opposite. However the
basic rules for describing this person would be very similar to describing a
friend.

  
Read the tips for the cue card ‘[Describe a friend who you really like to
spend time with](/cue-card-sample/500-ielts-cue-card-
sample-19-describe-a-friend "IELTS Cue Card Sample 19 - Describe a friend" )’
that you can also apply for answering this cue card.

**We accidentally made friends in many different ways and some of the common ways are:**

1\. We meet someone in a party/ park/ occasion and start a conversation and
find that there are lots of common interests between us. We simply exchange
our email address or phone number and keep in touch.

2\. We find someone in need of help and raise our helping hands and thus the
person becomes grateful and keeps communicating and thus the friendship grows.

3\. Sometimes a friend introduces with his/her friend who later become our
friend. (This is a very common reason)

4\. We meet someone helpful in a time when we need certain helps and thus the
person helps us can later become our friend.

5\. We meet people in our journey and some of them have influential
personality, common interest and thus can become our friends.

6\. We mistakenly get letters, emails or couriers from an unknown person who
later becomes our friend because of the follow up communications. etc.



###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. Which one is better, being introvert or extrovert?**  
**Answer:** I think there is no definitive answer to this question as it is a controversial issues and everyone has different opinion. On the one hand, an introvert enjoys solitude and operates as a loner most of the time. Furthermore, they have only few friends and they don't open up easily to others about personal matters. Great scientists, poets, artists and talented people were often introvert. Being introvert means people will have more time to think and create something new.  
  
On the other hand, being extrovert means that someone is friendly, outgoing,
sociable, affectionate and has large groups of friends. Oftentimes, they
engage in different kinds of activities and they share things that concern
them with their friends. Regarding which type of personality is more
preferable, I would say that ambivert people is the answer to me. I don't
think that being totally introvert or extrovert is good, but combining these
two types would be the most appropriate.

**Q. What type of person  you are?**  
**Answer:** That's a really difficult question for me and I confess that I haven't even thought about it. The truth is that I have only 5 close friends, they are like siblings to me and I discuss anything that happens in my life with them. I wouldn't say that I'm always an outgoing and sociable person except for the times that I really want to. For example, I am not the type of girl who will go out every day and meet new people but when I was at university I showed others the social part of myself in order to make friends. I know it sounds a little weird and creepy, but this is the way I am. So, I would say that I'm more of an introvert person, with some elements of extroversion when needed.    
  
Tip: Say about your type of personality, for example whether you are introvert
or extrovert and justify it with examples from your life. You can also say
that you are an ambivert person by having characteristics from both types -
introvert and extrovert. In any case, exemplify your answer.

**Q. What type of person  you are?**  
**Answer:** 'Friend' is a sacred notion for me and they are as important as family. First of all, as I mentioned earlier, friends are nothing less than siblings to me and they are the people we have chosen to have in our life for whatever reason. A real and strong friendship should be based on true feelings and not on selfishness. Virtues like love, trust, honesty, compassion, affection and kindness are indispensable parts of this concept. Moreover, being there when your friend needs you, help them whenever you can, console them when they get hurt and be happy with their achievements are some of the main characteristics. Everyone should invest in emotions and show them to friends in certain circumstances. Besides, if people don't give and receive love in their life, nothing would have a meaning and I believe friends are there to do just that.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 8 - Your Study room

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**



##  **Describe your study room**

**You should say:**  

  * how it looks like
  * how much time you spend in this room
  * how an ideal study room should be

**and give details of your study room.  
  
Follow-up Questions:**  
• How does a study room help a student?  
• Do you like to study? What type of books do you read?  
• Which do you prefer? Reading or traveling? Why?

![Describe your study
room](/images/IELTS_cue_card/IELTS_Cue_Card_Describe_your_study_room.jpg)



**Model Answer 1:**  
Describing my study room is easy – but perhaps a little embarrassing!
Firstly, I will tell you what it looks like, then I’ll talk about how much I
spend using it before comparing it with what my ideal study room might be
like.  That way you will have all the details of my study room.

I am lucky because there is a ‘spare’ room in my flat which I can use as a
study space.  That’s the good news.   The problem is that the room has also
ended up being a dumping ground for everything else that doesn’t have a home.
It is full of clutter.  The room hosts a large double bed, already made up in
case of guests, and a wardrobe.  There is also a small chest of drawers and a
bedside table.  Also stored in the room are a Henry Hoover (a type of vacuum
cleaner); an ironing board, a clothes rack and a set of low clothes rails that
I use to hang out washing to dry. These items and bits of furniture all added
together don’t leave very much space for me to work in.  Even so, I have a
table in the corner of the room.  It is quite light, as it is positioned right
underneath a duplex window – that’s a sort of sloping window set into the roof
– my flat is on the top floor of a converted old house, so it is actually an
attic space.

The table is reasonably sized, but I’m afraid it’s also rather cluttered.  I
have a couple of sets of in-trays on my desk, full of writing paper items
(notebooks and reams of A4 paper), together with letters and documents
awaiting my attention.  There is also a tin full of pens, pencils,
highlighters and other odds and ends which takes up more space, and a an old
shoe box full of envelopes and cards that I tend to stock up on in case I need
to send a friend a birthday card or quick message.  I still like to send
messages traditionally through the post for special occasions, rather than
using email or texting.  In the middle of my desk is my laptop, on which I do
all my work.  That doesn’t leave any spare room, so my printer is on the floor
under the table.  I have to crawl on my hands and knees to retrieve paper from
it when necessary!

Even though the space isn’t ideal, I do try and discipline myself to go in
there every day to do some work free of other distractions.  At least a couple
of hours a day, but obviously if I have an important deadline then I can spend
all day and half the night in there ‘burning the midnight oil’ to use an
English expression.  I sit on a little swivel office chair, that was actually
very, very cheap to purchase and looks rather flimsy, but is in fact extremely
comfortable.  That was a bargain buy, I must have had it 15 years at least.

My ideal study room would be airy, spacious and uncluttered.  It would be a
dedicated room, rather than a shared space that ends up collecting all the
over-flow from every other room in the home.  I’d have a huge table, with neat
piles of documents and space to spread out reference materials if needed.  I’d
prefer a window I could properly see out of, rather than one in the roof, but
I do like the natural light.  If money were no object, all my stationery would
match, and I’d have a printer that never jammed or ran out of ink.   A neat
wooden filing cabinet would contain all my paperwork filed away in an orderly
fashion.  In one corner I’d have a cosy armchair by a window overlooking a
beautiful garden.  When I needed inspiration I’d be able to sit in it, gazing
out of the view and thinking wise thoughts.  I’d also like an endlessly
refilling pot of hot fresh coffee, though I expect if I did all that caffeine
would be very bad for me.

So you can see why I’m a little embarrassed by my study room, I’m ashamed it
is such a cluttered area.  Even so, when I find I’m really focused on some
interesting project I don’t notice my surroundings.  Unfortunately, if I don’t
really want to face up to the task I’m supposed to be working on then it is
very easy to be distracted when I’m so squashed in by the chaos around me.
One day I might have to have a serious clear up, though I really don’t know
where else I’d put all those things if I do.

[ Written by - **Lucy Marris**:  Careers Adviser (UK), TEFL teacher (Vietnam)
]

**Sample Answer 2:**   
My study room and living room is the same one and I spend most of my time in
this room whenever I am home. It’s a square size room that has been painted in
white colour. It has got 2 doors, 2 windows, one attached bathroom and a north
facing veranda. The bed is placed beside the bigger window. Warm and fresh air
keeps the room healthy for breathing. Among other possessions I’ve got a
computer desk, a bed table, a wardrobe, 2 bookshelves, one reading desk, one
bed table, and a dressing table. One bookshelf is full of novels and story
books and the other one with academic books. I keep my notepads, diary, boxes
and other necessary things amid of the study desk. I read mostly on my desk
and sometimes on my bed. In case of story books, I prefer to read in bed. For
academic reading and writing I mostly use my desk. My study room has not got
plenty of luxurious furniture but I keep my things organized and clean. In day
time I keep my windows and prefer not to turn on the light. My mother
sometimes takes the authority to arrange and clean the room. I have arranged
my story books based on Author and the academic books on Subject.

My study room and living room gives me comfort in terms of quietness.
Sometimes I pick my chair on the Veranda and lit a table light and read book
there at night. There are several other rooms in our house but my study room
is quite soothing to me. I feel more comfortable at my study room than any
other room in our house.

###  Tips for talking about this cue card topic:

While describing your study room you should say if this is a separate room or
you use your bed room for study. If this is a separate room say if this is
private study room or is it shared by other family members. This cue card
usually expects you to be able to talk about the details of your reading room
so give every details possible including the dimension, colour, size of the
room and even the number of window, door and balcony. Then give details about
the furnitures and books you have there. Explain why this is an ideal place
for study and how often you read there. you will have 1 minute to prepare for
the cue card and within this one minute picture an ideal study room using your
imagination and take points of those. Then one by one describe those points.  
  
**Following is an example of the points you should take in the preparation phase of one minute:**  
  
1\. separate room, lots of books: academic books, story books and magazines.  
2\. square shaped, have 2 book shelves, books are categorized.  
3\. about 400 square foot, white colour, open spaces. quiet and peaceful.  
4\. Furniture: Tables, chairs, laptop, table lamp, couch etc.  
5\. An ideal room for study: quiet, spacious, lots of fresh air  
  
Now that you have enough points to describe your topic cards, arrange your
sentences and describe them one by one. That you give you enough points for
talking about more than 4-5 minutes.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. How does a study room help a student?  
**Answer:** **The most important aspect about having a separate study room is that it's completely quiet and personal. It gives a nice environment for studying and preparing for the exam. People can be totally isolated in their study rooms and can concentrate on what they want to do as they aren't easily distracted. Other places and rooms like internet cafes, drawing room or university campus have other people present and that can be a interruption for a student. Contrary to this a study room is the most suitable places for a student to study. Moreover, they can access the Internet, read or write, allocate their time in study and take rest whenever they want. This is not possible in other places. Therefore, a study room can lead to a more effective and constructive way of studying and offer an even easier way of understanding and assimilating the new information and knowledge. Finally, a student can be totally himself whenever he is in his study room without worrying what others would think about him. 

****Q. **Do you like to study? What type of books do you read?  
**

**Possible answer 1: ** I love to read books-  be it a reference book, novel or a biography. Sometimes reading for the exam is boring, but the result is always great as the study times enhance my knowledge. As I have already completed my graduation, I mostly read books that interest me the most. This includes fiction, biography, history and reference books. I am an active member of Goodreads, which is a website of extensive user-populated database of books, annotations, and reviews. This website is a great source for picking up a book to read. Besides I maintain a technology related blog and to update this blog I need to read different articles and posts online.        
  
**Possible answer 2:** The truth is that I don't like the process of studying but the outcome. When the time comes and I really have to study, I'm completely bored and sleepy. But as time goes by, I discover that I am equipped with the rudimentary knowledge that is necessary not only for my studies but also my future career and life. Now that I've graduated from university, I really enjoy reading books from my last semester and especially those related to businesses. As becoming a business consultant is my dream job and I'm very close to achieve that, I am motivated to spend some of my free time reading books about enterprises and gaining significant and useful knowledge. 

****Q. **Which do you prefer? Reading or traveling? Why?**  
**Answer:** It's an interesting question and really difficult for me to answer. Both pastimes are not only entertaining but also important in people's life. Reading can help someone acquiring knowledge, skills and competencies and of course activate our mind. Books are unparalleled in creating enlightened citizens in a society.    
  
Travelling on the other hand, broadens your horizons, allows you to make new
acquaintances and meet people from around the world and swap opinions,
attitudes and interests. In addition to this, you can become knowledgeable
about a country's history, customs and culture by travelling and this results
in becoming a more broad minded and less regressive person. It is indeed a
tough call for me to decide my preference between these two! However if I have
to, I would say that travelling is a bit more preferable to reading, because
it offers me a chance to witness things and events that I never want to miss.  
  
_**Tip: **_You can say that you prefer one of the two or even both. You have
to explain the reasons for your choice and it would be good to tell why you
don't like the other one.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe Your Favorite movie

**You should say:**

  * What’s the name of the movie/ film?
  * What’s the theme of the movie/ film?
  * Why do you like it?

**and describe the story of the movie in brief.**  
  
**Follow-up Questions:**  
• Describe a war movie you like.  
• What’s the difference between the movies or your country and Hollywood
movies?  
• What do you think of the violent films?  
• Why movies need computer techniques? Any example of movie using computer
techniques?  
• Which parts of movie are the most important and how to improve it?  
  
**Possible Answer:**  
The name of my faourite movie is 'Casablanca' which was directed by Michael
Curtiz. It was released in 1943 and the story was adopted from a stage-play
named 'Everybody comes to Ricks'. The movie starred Humphery Bogart &amp;
Ingrid Bergman and was made in USA. It was a romantic drama film and the
story-line was set during the World War II.  
  
It focuses on a man torn between love &amp; virtue. In 1941 American expatriot
Rick who professed to be neutral by all means met his former lover Ilsa in his
nightclub &amp; gambling den. She was accompanied by her husband, Laszlo, a
renowned fugitive Czech Resistance Leader. They needed a letter to escape to
America, where he can continue his work against Nazis. German Major came to
Casablanca to see that Laszlo does not succeed. One night Ilsa confronted Rich
in the deserted cafe and asked for the letter. She threatened him with a gun
for the letter and later on confessed that she still loves him. Rick's
bitterness dissolved learning that IIsa was married to Laszlo before even
their relationship began. When Rick and IIsa planned to flew together, she
could not do so because all of a sudden she found that her husband was still
alive and needed her badly to recover. Hearing the story Rick calmed down and
agreed to give the letter to Laszlo so that he can fly to America safely. They
would take a different path to fly away together. But finally Rick let IIsa
and Laszlo fly to America which surprised IIsa very much.

In 1989, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National
Film Registry a being deemed 'Culturally', 'Historically' and 'Aesthetically'
significant. It is the 2nd best movie of all time based on AFI's 100 best
movies of all time.

I've seen the movie more than 2-3 times. The story is excellent, the casting,
plot, acting, dialogues and all other aspects of the movie is superb. The
movie deeply touched me and became the most favourite movie I have ever seen.

it as '**Movie**'.

###  Part 3 - Details Discussion:

**Q. Describe a war movie you like.  
**Answer:** **I’m going to tell you about ‘Braveheart’, a war movie directed by Mel Gibson, who was also the leading character. The movie was released in 1995 and it was written by Randall Wallace. In 14th century, William Wallace, a Scottish warrior, leads his people in a rebellion against the tyranny of the English King, who has given English nobility the 'Prima Nocta' - a right to take all new brides for the first night. The Scots are none too pleased with the brutal English invaders, but they lack leadership to fight back. Wallace creates a legend of himself, with his courageous defence of his people and attacks on the English. The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards at the 68th Academy Awards and won five: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Makeup, and Best Sound Editing. 

Other war movies you can say about: The Pianist, Saving Private Ryan, Black
Hawk Down, Apocalypse Now, Good Morning Vietnam, War Horse, Downfall, Lincoln,
and Imitation Game.

**Q. What’s the difference between the movies of your country and Hollywood movies?  
**Answer:** **I believe that the movies in my country aren’t that good as Hollywood movies are. First of all, the budget is really low for the local movies and that is why there are very limited opportunities. Not all scenes are impressive and there are no special effects, something that dominates in Hollywood. Furthermore, the actors in local movies aren’t so famous and talented, on the contrary in Hollywood they are of worldwide fame. There are a large variety on the topic and theme of Hollywood movies. However, our local movies do not deal with a wide range of themes. Finally Hollywood movies are released and enjoyed worldwide while our local movies are mostly made for us except some very few movies that get international attention. 

**Q. What do you think of the violent films?  
**Answer:** **I would say that it depends on the type of violence. To be more precise, I like movies with violent scenes because they’re interesting and include more actions. In those movies the good wins over bad. It’s a kind of vindication and the message that good prevails over bad. I don’t like movies that involve rapes. In particular, I hate these movies. I would not say that it’s something that isn’t happening, but I think that promoting women’s humiliation and debasement is not a good thing. So, I would come to the conclusion that I partly like violent movies and specifically, it depends on the story. However the unnecessary violence is not liked by all and I am no exception. 

**Q. What do you think of the violent films?  
**Answer:** **Well, computer techniques should be used to add some characteristics to movies so that they can be more impressive and believable. Especially nowadays this opportunity is much more in use than the past. Many things that were unfeasible are attainable now with the computer technology in movie industries. A remarkable example could be ‘Avatar’, a movie that was critically acclaimed and had a million views worldwide. The groundbreaking visual effects used to make humans look like extraterrestrial beings were amazing and that was the primary reason that the film broke several box office records and became the highest-grossing film of all time in England, Canada and the USA. 

**Q. Which parts of movie are the most important and how to improve it?  
**Answer:** **It is an undeniable fact that all the parts of a movie are extremely important, but it seems to me that more attention should be given to the finishing of a movie. There are many examples of movies that were very interesting but the end was extremely boring and disappointing. In this case I totally believe that the end negates all the good things that happened in the rest of the movie and leaves a bad impression to the viewers. So, my opinion is that the last part/ finishing part of a film should be of paramount importance and it can be achieved by providing a distinct and not vague message to the viewers and making things clear in their mind. 

_**Tip: **_You can say about other things such as the beginning, the plot,
dialogues, directing, special effects or even the acting. It’s up to you and
your personal opinion.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a friend who you really like to spend time with.

**You should say:**

  * When and how you met.
  * How often you see this friend.
  * What kind of personality your friend has

**and say why you like to spend time with this particular friend.**

**Follow-up Questions:**  
• Is friendship important in your culture? How many close friends can you
have?  
• Are friends more important than family?  
• What are the important things among good friends?  
• Do you have any friends from foreign country?  
• What are the difference between real life friends and pen friends?

**Possible answer 1:**  
The friend I like to spent time with is Steven. I met him when I was only 8
years old and was in primary school. After that our intimacy grew up and we
became best friends. One day he forgot to bring his book in school and that
day I helped him with my expire books. After that we talked for a long after
school and our friendship started to begin. We went to college together and
then got admitted in different Universities. Since we were studying in the
same city, we can meet each other and spend time together.

We are yet to finish our graduation and busy with our own stuffs but whenever
we get vacation we spend time together. Since our hometown is same, we go
there together and thus we meet each other at least twice in a month. He is a
helpful and talented friend who helps people and always wished best for
people. He is studying Mathematics and he has a talent in Mathematics.
Sometimes he explains some complex mathematical theories in a very simple and
interesting way. He is passionate about reading books and that makes a good
bonding with me. We often exchange our thought and criticism about books and
politics.

I like to spend time with him because we have many common interests between
us. I never feel bored spending time with him. Since we are friends for a long
time, we understand each other. A good friend always extends helping hands
when in need and I've found Steven by my side always. We do so many fun stuffs
together and help each other in our study. Good friendship, understanding and
common interests makes us close friends and those are the major factors for
what I like to spend time with his.

**Sample Answer 2: **  
I happened to meet this person who later became my friend in a yoga and
meditation class which I joined quite lately. It was quite a chance that this
person who goes by the name, Gajender, sat beside me during the class.

The reason why I like spending time with him is the positive vibes that I feel
out of him. He is one of the persons, rather the first person in my life whom
I have met having a very positive attitude towards the life.

I always found him in jubilant mood in spite of the fact that he had a very
troublesome incident in his life. He lost his only son and that too at a young
age of 25. I must say, he is one of the persons who have really made a
positive impression on my mind and has contributed a lot in the way I have
started looking at life.

After these classes, it has been quite a regular feature that I spend my time
in his company, almost every weekend. Yet another reason why I like spending
time with Gajender is the humorous character that he possesses.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

This cue card should be an easy one as you would already know a lot about a
friend you would like to talk about. Topics like 'Describe a museum needs some
brainstorming, remembering things about a museum and then organizing answers
for this topic. But when you are asked to talk about a friend, you already
know a lot. All you need to do is focus on the questions asked and then answer
the questions in details.

For this cue card, tell the name of a friend. Remember that you have picked a
friend to talk about that means s/he is a very close and special friends of
yours. Talk about for how long you two are friends, how you met him and how
your friendship started.

Then say the things you two do together, why you like him/her, how is he/she
and why you like to spend time with him.

Following are some hints on the questions asked in this cue card topic.  
  
**When and how you met:**  
Answer from your experience. If you are out of idea, you can say:  
You met him/her at the school, S/he is your neighbor and you two met in a
family occasion, you met him/her in a playground while playing, you met
him/her in a relative’s house, you met him/her in a situation when s/he needed
help and you were there to help or the vice versa, you can also mention you
met at college/university or even all of a sudden in a shopping mall/
auditorium/ park. Sometimes friendship starts from fights and quarrel and for
this you can mention that you had a fight in an issue but later you two become
close.  
  
A friend can be an online friend whom you have met only few times or may be
never met. In this scenario your friendship can start from an online chat-room
or from a social networking platform.  
  
**How often do you meet?**  
To answer this question you need to focus on the previous question and the
context. If you talk about a friend who lives in the same street or study /
work with you then you would meet him daily. If you pick a friend from your
hometown where you no longer live, then your meeting frequency would be 2-5
times a year or so. For online friends whom you have never met, simply say
that you have never mate him/her in person but you talk/ chat over internet
almost every day.  
  
**What kind of personality your friend has:**  
For this question, say that s/he is very friendly, helpful and caring. S/he
values your friendship and always raises a helping hand. For his/her
personality, say that s/he is talented, creative and has an attractive
personality. Also mention that s/he is understanding and well-behaved. For
online friend, mentioning personality is bit tough as you might have never met
him/her.  In this case, say that s/he is caring and have positive attitudes
and his/her opinion on different issues seems very well thought and positive.
Mention something s/he does for the benefits or others and you were attracted
to some of his activities.  
  
**Why do you like spending time with this particular person?**  
 Naturally people like to spend time with people who have common interest and
have positive attitudes. So you should mention what common interests you have
and what you do together (for online friends, say the topics you discuss and
share). Also you can say you have learned many positive things from him/her
and you two have a great understanding.  Also say that s/he is a good friend
who is ready to support you no matter what and has already advised you or
helped you in different issues.

**Your preparation for this cue card topic should also help you answering the following topics:**  
  
**1\. Talk about a childhood friends you remember.  
2\. Describe a friend from your hometown.  
3\. Describe one of your online friends.  
4\. Describe an activity you do with your friends.  
5\. Describe a friend you like to spend time with.  
6\. Talk about a friend who helped you once.  
7\. Talk about a friend whom you helped.  
8\. Describe a friend from your college/ university.  
9\. Talk about a friend whom you met accidentally.**  


###  Part 3: Follow-up Questions:

**Q. Is friendship important in your culture? How many close friends can you have?   **  
Answer: Friendship is really important indeed and I think that it should be of
paramount importance in all cultures worldwide. Our friends are our siblings
and those people who we have chosen to have in our lives. Moreover, a friend
is a person you can call whenever you are sad, happy, angry, excited and so
on. We should take into account that many people in different countries
consider their pals to be more valuable than their own parents. As far as I’m
concerned, I believe that someone can have two or three close friends and I
can tell that from my personal experiences.

**_Tip:_** This is just a personal opinion about the number of friends someone can have. It's up to you and your experiences. 

**Q. Are friends more important than family?**  
Answer: That’s a really difficult question to answer. It is widely accepted
that parents are those people with whom we are connected by blood and also our
closest relatives. Friends, on the other hand, are just some people we come
across during our lifespan and it’s our choice whether we will keep them in
our life or not. But, as I mentioned earlier, there are many adults who
consider that friendship is more important compared to family and the reasons
for this may differ. From my point of view, I would argue that parents and
friends should be equally important in someone’s life, because a fulfilling
and complete life consists of both family and sidekicks. Besides, life without
a friend is death without a witness.

_**Tip:**_ You can say that family and friends are equally important to
someone's life, family is more important than friends and cite arguments and
examples and finally friends are more essential than family and cite arguments
and give examples.

**Q. What are the important things among good friends?**  
Answer: First and foremost, people should take into account that friendship is
a sacred notion in someone’s life and a two-way-street as well. Friends should
invest in real feelings and there are some virtues that are crucial. For
example, true friends must be honest with each other, compassionate, be there
when needed, affectionate, tender and supportive to mention but a few. Every
friendship has their ups and downs but when emotions are real any hindrance
can be eliminated. To conclude, a wise and useful phrase that comes to my mind
is “A friend in need is a friend indeed”.

**Q. Do you have any friends from foreign country?**  
1st Possible Answer: Unfortunately, I don’t but I really hope to make new
acquaintances and meet people from overseas. In this way I am convinced that
I’ll become more broad minded and tolerant.

2nd Possible Answer: Actually I do. I live and study in England so I have met
many people from different countries even from different continents. I really
like consorting with them because we can swap opinions, make helpful and
substantial conversations and learn new things about cultures, customs and
points of view. In addition, we can travel to each other’s country and
accomplish dreams and desires that otherwise might be unachievable. Last but
not least, we can immerse ourselves in a new language and gain more knowledge.  
  
**Q. What are the difference between real life friends and pen friends?**  
Answer: The difference is significant because in the first case there are
stronger bonds and in the second the existing ties are slack. The former, are
people that can be seen in the flesh and any person can spend some time with,
have frequent contact and share some intrinsic moments. The latter, are people
that correspond with each other and it could be considered as a kind of
distant relationship. Furthermore, a real friend is able to be with you at
whatever moment, while for a pen friend this is unfeasible.

![IELTS Cue card - describe someone in your family](/images/IELTS_cue_card
/IELTS_Cue_Card-_describe_someone_in_your_family.jpg)

**Model Answer 1:**  
I've got a small family with only five members and all of us are very close to
each other and we love each other very much. Among them I love my mother more
than anyone else in the whole world. I adore my mother for her caring, loving,
adorable behaviors and wit. She is the person I can share everything with and
that's the reason I worship her so much.

Possibly she was the first human I saw when I opened my eyes in this world. A
relationship with a mother is divine and all of my childhood memories are
either related to my mom or my school. I can still remember a day I was late
to come back home after school and that's because there was a ceremony at the
school I did not know about. All of a certain I found that my mother was
entering through the school-gate to find me. I was so frightened that my
mother would rebuke me for being late unnoticed and she must be mad at me. But
to my best surprise, when my mother saw me  she had a warm smile in her face
that I'll never forget till my last breath in this earth. Then she hugged me
and gave me a kiss. I felt then that I love my mother more than me. She
attended the program at the school and afterward we came back home together.

I spent my 19 years or so with my father and mother but I stay at a
metropolitan city now for my education. Whenever I get vacation I meet my
mother at my village home. On an average I spend 2/3 months with my mother
each year but I talk to her over phone almost twice a day.

The reasons why I admire her are endless. She is caring, tender, she has got a
big heart and she possesses love for everyone. She had been an ideal mother to
raise 3 kids and making sure our education and moral values. She had made a
lot of sacrifices all of her life and had never complained about anything to
my best knowledge. She is the person who reminds me the power of love and
caring.

**Sample Answer 2: **  
A person I admire is my “Mother” because she is a fighter. You may ask why? To
start of my mom got pregnant, with me at the age of 18. She did not have the
support of my grandparents. Her own parents wanted to kick her out the house
when they found out. She convinced them to let her stay, but she could not ask
them for any help when raising the baby. Knowing all this my mom still decided
to have the baby.

Besides not having the support of her parents, she also did not receive any
help from my father. Although my father cared about me, he never gave my mom
money or clothes to help her maintain me as a baby. She had to provide for me
on her own. Going to school and working was killing her, but she wanted me to
have a good life so she did anything that she could. My mom got pregnant again
two years later, with the same man. The only thing was this time - it was
worse. He left her life completely and her dad was sick. Therefore, he could
no longer work. Now, not only did she have to provide for her two babies, but
also for her parents. She was overwhelmed with everything happening; she
didn't know what to do.

Finally, she decided to attend college and become a teacher for she can
support the family she was now in charge of. It was not an easy thing to do.
After she finished college it took her a while to find a job. It is not easy
to find a job in Nicaragua. However, my mom never quit, no matter how hard
things got for her she fought through it. To provide for her kids and parents.

[Written by – Rafael]

**Alternative Answer 3:**  
I have got 6 family members and all of them are very dear and close to me. If
I need to pick one family member among them to talk about, that would be my
father. My father’s name is (say your father’s name) and he is around 50 years
old. He is the kind of person I would want my offspring to be. He did his
graduation in a time when formal education was not people’s first choice. They
would rather start earning from work rather than going to school. My father
fought to ensure his education with the people who thought working or doing
some sort of business has more value than education. But my father believed
that education is the most important part of a man’s life. He heartily held
the idea that education shapes a man’s life and is the kind of power and asset
that would always accompany him.  
  
I have lots of memories of my father and I see him every day. There exists a
strong bonding between us that only two of us feel. I still remember those
days of my childhood when I used to wait in the evening for my father to
return from office. He would then play with me and help on completing my
lessons. I vividly remember him sometimes taking me to the market and buy me
gifts. When I was an infant he moved to the city from the village to ensure me
better schooling and environment. That was a decision that has changed my life
path. He himself helped me finishing my home works and lessons, always allured
me of gifts if I could complete my study. Besides my education he taught me
lots of moral values and important things of life.  
  
He used to work in a Government organization and for his hard-working and
kindness; he is revered by all of our relatives, his friends and neighbors.

He believes in humanity, good behavior, our creator, and leads a life that can
be exemplary. He still does most of his own works and helps my mom on her

###  Part 3 - Details Discussion:

**Q. What are the values of family in your country?  
Answer:** That's a really important question. First of all, I believe that
family values don't differ from country to country and allow me to say that
they should be the same throughout the world. As far as I’m concerned, the
most essential values of a family are the so-called moral values, which enable
people to draw plausible distinctions between right and wrong, good and bad,
true and false. The lessons learned from the family are invaluable throughout
our life.

Furthermore, the family values are vital in making decisions and can be
obtained by personal and life experiences with close relationship with family
members. To be more specific, some examples could be: being honest and
trustworthy, courageous and patient, taking up responsibilities as well as
adding values to the world are the norms of our family and society. Family is
so important and we stand for our family members no matter what. Thus the
family comes first is the morality everyone in our country believes. We also
consider a family as the unit of a society or a country and bonding,
relationship, trustworthiness, helpfulness are lessons that comes with the
close family ties.

**Q. How family bonding is necessary for happiness in life?  
Answer: **Our parents are the reason for our existence and with them we get a
family. Parents are the first people we see and rely when we open our eyes for
the first time. Moreover, parents are the primary educator and they teach
their children how to develop confidence, socialization skills, morals, values
and views in life. Since they are the base of our family, closeness in a
family leads people to have an intrinsically fulfilling and flourishing life.

This can be justified by the fact that kids who enjoy strong family bonding
tend to be happier and mentally healthier that those who are in a
dysfunctional family environment.

**Q. What type of family do you like? Nuclear family or joint family?  
Answer: **That’s really an interesting question! My personal opinion is that a
nuclear family is much more preferable to me compared to a joint family. The
reason for my preference is possibly because I grew up in a nuclear family and
it was a pleasant memory for me.  Besides, in a nuclear family there are the
couple and their children and in this situation anything is manageable and
family members have stronger relationship. Fighting and quarrel are scare in
nuclear families.

On the other hand, the second type of family is extended family or joint
family and includes grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins and so on. I prefer
quiet environment than noisy one. In a joint family this is unlikely to happen
and people always do not have privacy. Therefore, I strongly believe that a
family only with mum, dad and siblings works better for me.

**Q. How family value and bonding have changed over the last decade?  
Answer:** Unfortunately, the sacred notion of a family has lost its meaning to
a certain extent in the last ten years. People don’t invest in feelings
anymore and don’t retreat as well. Nowadays quarrels between couples are a
frequent occurrence and because women are financially independent, they don’t
step back like they did many years ago. Moreover, a principal cause that has
led to this situation is the internet. When family members have some spare
time they prefer to consume it by going online instead of having some family
conversations. I would jump to the conclusion that people who decide to create
a family should let go off their ego and in difficult times they should also
think that their children want their parents to be happy and together.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe the best gift/ present you have received.

**You should say:**

  * what the gift was
  * who gave it to you
  * when you received it

**And explain why it was the best gift/ present you have ever received.**  
  
**Follow-up Questions:**

  * Do you think that present giving will play an important role in daily life? Why?
  * Compare the gift which people have received 10 years ago to the present that people now are receiving? What's the difference between them?
  * Do you think that the brand name is very important for sales?

**Possible Answer 1:**  
In my life I have got numerous gifts and presents and among them most exciting
and best gift was the Laptop my father gave me when I was 14 years old. When I
was 10 years old, I found that many of my friends had their own laptops and
desktop computers. I was heavily fascinated about this wonder machine and
dreamed about owning one someday. After getting admitted in grade 6, I got
admitted in a computer training center and learned the basic computing.
Whenever I visited any my friends who had a computer, I felt overwhelmed
playing games, learning new software, trying to browse internet etc. over
there. I sometimes visited some of my friends’ houses more often than usual
only because they had computers. Thus this machine became the only dream of my
life. As I knew that my father won’t be able to buy a computer for me, I did
not ask for one. I made a dummy computer using papers and boards and played
with it. One day I bought a savings bank and started saving coins and notes
there. After one month I found that I have saved very few amount to purchase a
computer!  
  
I got busy with other stuffs and could hardly find times to visit friends’
houses to use their computer but in a corner of my heart I felt the same
fascination for owning a computer. On my 14th birthday, my father told me that
he wants to take me to the computer shop and purchase one for me. I could not
believe what I was hearing. That night it was tough for me to sleep. In the
morning I wake up earlier than usual and went to the computer shop with my
father. He bought a Dell Laptop that was Pentium 4 machine. While returning
home, I found myself flying in joy. I opened the box after returning home and
showed it to my mother and other relatives.  
  
As a kid, that was a long expected gift that my father gave me and till now
it’s the best gift/ present I have ever received.

**Cue Card Answer 2:**  
First of all, I would like to thank you for this nice topic. The best gift or
present that I have ever received is a digital dictionary that my mother
bought me on my 18th birthday. I was a college student at that time and my
parents celebrated my birthday at home. Few friends and relatives were invited
and it was a kind of family celebration. I was quite excited to open the gift
boxes that my friends and family members gave me and there were some books,
chocolate boxes and other gift items. Out of these gift items, an electronic
dictionary was there in a small box with an ordinary wrapping paper around it.
As soon as I opened it, I knew it was a gift from my mother.  
  
I once told my mother about this electronic dictionary and how some of my
classmates used it. I never told my mother that I wanted to buy one but I
guess my mother knew very well how much I wanted to own this item. She had to
save money, I guess, to purchase it for me and this is the best gift I have
received ever. This was not merely a gift item or an electronic device, it was
more than that- like a wonder box wrapped with care and love. My mother is a
housewife and managing the money to buy me this gift must have been a result
of her many small sacrifices. I thanked my mother for this fabulous gift and
she was so happy to see me excited about the gift.  
  
It was a while coloured small digital dictionary, not more than 4 by 6 inches
in dimension, but was one of the latest models. It was quite handy for me and
having this dictionary encouraged me to learn more words, their synonyms and
their origins.  
  
The gifts are always good gestures and tokens of appreciation and love, in our
tradition. This gift was something special to me. I knew how much my mother
has always loved me and her gift represented her love as well as sacrifices
for me. In terms of utilisation, it was quite handy for me. I could easily
carry it in my pocket and I used it quite often to learn new words and that
has helped enhancing my language skill. This is the only gift from my teenage
that I still have. I will always remember my mother's love that was blended
with this gift and the unparalleled utilisation this device has brought was
also important.

###  Tips for answering this Cue card question:

Think about a gift that you received from one of your family members,
relatives, friends, colleges or someone else. Write down the name and the
person who gave it to you as well as when did you receive it and what was the
occasion. Being able to point out those questions would help you to answer
this cue card. The give can be from someone special and for this the gift can
be a simple friendship card or a book. Does not matter if it is an expensive
and exclusive gift or not, most important part is the importance of the gift.  
  
The gift can be something other than the conventional gift items like: a life
changing advice that you consider as a gift. If you are father, you can say
your kid is the best gift you have got is your kid and that was given by the
almighty.  
  
For gifts like cell phone, computer or a necessary equipment or device,
mention that you have been wishing to own this but could not and after you
received that, you felt overwhelmed. A gift from parents on your birthday can
also be a good example of best gift you received. For such gifts, mention that
you received it in your childhood and had been touched by the whole idea.  
  
For this cue card the gift item is not itself important, be it an ordinary
piece of gift or a very luxurious item, so emphasize on your feeling rather
than the gift itself.

###  Part 3 - Details Discussion:

**Q. Do you think that present giving will play an important role in daily life? Why?  
Answer:** It seems to me that this is a bit ambiguous. More precisely, present
giving is something that occurs in special events, for example, at birthdays,
festivals, anniversaries, wedding, graduation day, on name days, when someone
visit others and so on. I don't think that there are many people around the
world who give presents to their loved ones or to friends on a daily basis.
Furthermore, with regards to the future, I am of the opinion that giving gifts
won't have a special role in everyday life either because, as I said earlier,
presents are given when something important happens. However there is no doubt
that present giving plays an important role in our relationship and that will
always remain the same.

**Q. Compare the gift which people have received 10 years ago to the present that people now are receiving? What's the difference between them?  
Answer:** To answer this question we have to go back to the past and think of
the types of presents we gave and received. Despite my young age, I have some
memories of such presents that my family and relatives gave me. I would say
that in the past, specifically 10 year ago, the types of gifts exchanged were
primarily clothes, toys, household appliances and books. Apart from the fact
that they weren't related to technology, they were also significantly
important, educational and in most cases really expensive. Nowadays, presents
are more of symbolic rather than substantial or useful. People these days
often give and receive technology related gifts which was quite rare in the
past. To illustrate, the important presents that I received on my last
birthday were perfumes and a laptop. Of course gifts items in all decades do
not remain the same. It will change for sure after ten years. The love and
good wishes behind a gift is more important that the item itself.

**Q. Do you think that the brand name is very important for sales?  
Answer:** My belief is that brand name really matters and it affect the sales
volume of a product. Most companies spend huge amount of money on branding in
order to make the product or service famous and well-known. We could say that
branding is an enterprise itself because it constitutes an amazingly important
part of the company and its viability. As branding is a core aspect for a
company, brand managers try to acquire customers and maintain relationships
with them. Moreover, through advertising, media exposure and celebrity
endorsement sales are on the rise most of the time for popular brands.  
  
Personally I would spend more money to purchase a branded product. Hence I am
quite positive that brand name is important for sales.

Follow-up Questions:**

![Describe one of your childhood
memories](/images/IELTS_cue_card/IELTS_Cue_Card_Describe_one_of_your_childhood_memories.jpg)

**Sample Answer 1:**  
Childhood memories are strange things, because sometimes you can’t quite be
sure if you really remember something, or if you just think you do because
others have told you about it, or you have seen a photo of the event later on.
I’m going to talk to you about a memory that I’m very confident is real.  I’ll
tell you what it is, when it happened, how it affected me and why I still
remember it.

The memory is the earliest one I have of me and my Dad.  I was very small
indeed, I’m not exactly sure how old, but I’d guess about three years old,
maybe even younger.  My Dad was not a particularly tall or strong man, but I
was small enough, and by comparison, he was big enough then, for me to stand
with both my feet on one of his, and to reach up with my arms and cling onto
his leg.  I would then hang on and laugh delightedly as he tried to go about
his daily business, walking around the house with me gripping on tightly
refusing to be budged.  It was a favourite game.

I don’t know that I can honestly say it affected me in my life.  However, in
my family we don’t really talk about things very much or do a lot together.
We don’t live particularly close to one another so see each other rather
infrequently.  I suppose the way the incident affected me was by making me at
a subconscious level feel close to my Dad even years later as we had shared
that happy play time together when I was tiny.

I didn’t know I had held onto this memory until quite recently.  Sadly my Dad
died, he had been very ill for a long time, so it wasn’t unexpected, but of
course it was very sad.  I wanted to say something about him at his funeral,
and I wanted to pick a memory that was personal just to him and to me.  For
some reason that image of me tiny and laughing and him solemnly ‘pretending’
that he hadn’t noticed I was there came into my mind and it seemed very
appropriate somehow to share that one.  It was a happy memory, but also an
intimate one.  I think he would have been really pleased that I could recall
it so many decades later.

So why can I remember it?  I’m not sure, but I like to think the memory was
there dormant all the time just waiting for the moment when I needed to
retrieve it.  It is a comforting thing to recall.  The human mind is an
amazing thing!

[ Written by - **Lucy Marris** | Careers Adviser (UK), TEFL teacher (Vietnam)
]

**Possible Answer 2:**   
I can still remember lots of thing I did in my childhood and things that
happened when I was a child.  Sometimes those memories seem so lucid that it
seems those events occurred only few days back. Anyway, a childhood memory I
can still remember so clearly is the first time when I saw massive death. I
was a kid of class three or four then and one day I heard that there had been
an accident near our home. My mother asked me whether I want to go or not. I
went with her and speculated lots of thing about the accident but when I
watched 10 dead people were kept lying in the ground and among them there were
2 kids too, I was devastated about the massive dead scene. I started feeling
sick and started vomiting there. My mother took me back to our home and I was
ill for about two days.

This memory was important to me because it helped me to think about the life
in a different way. I could realize then what the dead is and how fragile our
lives are. This memory helped me to grow faster and opened my eyes of vision.

**Alternative Answer 3:**  
I was born in a beautiful urban area called ..... (_say your birthplace name_)
and the place was full of magic and wonder. I spent my whole childhood there
and the place is full with my childhood memories. Childhood, is perhaps, the
most magical and beautiful time of our life and I cherish my childhood memory.
The one particular memory of my childhood I would never forget is the time I
first saw the devastating effect of accident. This event has a significant
importance of my life.

Like most other newly school going kids, I wanted to be Superman or Spiderman.
The life was full of dreams and fantasy. One day I was walking with my mom and
heard from the neighbours that a severe accident has happened nearby. I was
bit confused what was it all about. Finally I and mom reached at the place
where the accident took place. We saw that people had made a crowd around the
victims who were already dead. I observed the dead for the first time in my
life. We did not stay there for a long. After returning home I felt sick.
Later on I started realizing that our lives are fragile and are not eternal.
We all will die someday no matter what we think we are. That event helped me
growing up mentally. Not that I become pessimist from the event, but a
realization always knocked me. I started changing some of my silly attitudes
after the event. I started caring for my parents, relatives, known and unknown
people. I learned that our days are numbered and we've to make best use of it.
I was so deeply touched that I started praying everyday and became kind to
insects and animals. Some people might think that the event was devastating
for a kid, but to me, it revealed reality in front of me.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. Why childhood is important?  
**Answer:**** As far as I'm concerned, childhood is the purest and happiest period of human life without any concerns, stress and even cunning and wickedness. Every child is carefree and two thing that matters to them are playing and enjoying. In addition, as youngsters are fluid and flexible in the way they approach things, everyone, especially parents, should spend constructive time with them because this the period of life for learning and absorbing things in order to form their character and personality. More precisely, longitudinal research has shown that a person's successes, health and emotional wellbeing have their roots in early childhood.    
  
Childhood experiences define the way we behave and react in certain
circumstances in later stages in our life and our cognitive developments occur
faster at that time. Childhood is a magical stage in our life and has an
immense importance for the later stages of our life.

****Q. **How did you spend your childhood?  
**Answer: ****I spent my childhood by playing all the time and trying to avoid studying but without any success. I had many friends and we used to gather and play in our yards, especially hide and seek. I remember that I didn't like the fact that I always got caught by my friends. When I was at home though, I did drawing, painting and dancing most the time. So, I would say that I really enjoyed my childhood and the most vivid thing that I still remember is my mother begging me to complete my homework. My parents were so caring and loving and always loved to visit different places with them.    
  
_**Tip: **_You can say about your childhood by mentioning your hobbies, your
school, siblings, friends or even pleasant or unpleasant situations you had.

****Q. **Who was your childhood hero? Did you want to be like him/her?**  
**Answer:** When I was a child my hero was Superman. As I can remember, there was a TV series called 'Smallville' and the leading character in this TV series was a teenage boy whose name was Clark Kent. Clark was adopted and he had superhuman powers and I was entirely surprised by that because he was saving people all the time using those powers. But as a little kid, the thing that impressed me the most was that he wasn't only saving good people but also bad one who tried to hurt him and his beloved ones. Although he was my hero, I didn't want to be like him but like his girlfriend, Lana Lang, you know this is natural for a girl of my age. After this show I always wanted to have a superhero in my life and Superman was an indispensable part of my early childhood.  
  
Tip: Mention your own hero and describe him/her and his/her achievements. If
you didn't have any heroes, you can just say about common heroes such as
Superman, Batman, Spiderman or even your parents and relatives. Just tell the
examiner the reason why he or she was your hero and why you wanted to be like
him/her.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  **Describe a subject taught in your school**

**You Should Say:**

  * what subject it was and who taught it
  * how the teacher taught it
  * what you learned from the class

**and explain how it helped you.**  
  
**Follow-up Questions:**  
• Is there any difference between the traditional and modern educational
systems?  
• What are the pros and cons of the current educational system in your
country?  
• Do you think it is necessary to give comment or criticism to teachers?  
• How can a teacher make learning more interesting?  
• Are there any subjects that shouldn’t be taught in school? Why?  
• How can the school help students to overcome a problem with a certain
subject?  
• Do you think that visiting different websites has benefits for a student?

**Possible Answer:**  
The subject that I'd like to describe is Physics that was taught in our
school. We had this subject in each year of our high school and each year a
new teacher used to taught us the subject. Even we had to read physics in
college as Science was my major. I remember Mr. Alex, Burter, John, David and
Mrs. Jeniffer took Physics in different years. We were lucky to have good
Physics teachers who could make the subject interesting and enjoyable. Our
teachers used to tell us stories first and then would explain the theory,
experiment or math of the text books. They would then relate the story with
the study. Later they would explain us the real examples and facts. Sometimes
they used to take us to the Physics labs and explain how something works. I
have learned numerous things of physics from simple definition of mass to the
complex explanation of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. My foundation of
physics grew up and expanded with the help of those teachers.

The subject itself is utterly interesting if one can have passion for it. It
is one such subject that one would start loving it if s/he starts
understanding the underlying concepts of it. Physics is all around us and the
lesson I learned from my School had helped me greatly throughout my higher
academic years.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

You should pick a real academic subject like Math, English, Physics,
Chemistry, Literature, and Biology to answer this cue card. Then quickly take
some notes including the following:  
  
1\. In which class it was it taught.  
2\. Do not pick a subject taught in your college or university level as the
cue card is asking you to talk about a subject taught in your school.  
3\. Try to remember a teacher's name. You can mention multiple teachers' name
as the same subject in school is taught by different teachers in different
classes.  
4\. Give a short detail what the subject. For example: The Geography would
discuss about the Earth, the other planet in the solar system, atmosphere, and
climate changes etc. and you should mention those.  
5\. Next describe how the teacher taught the subject and what things you
learned from the class.  
6\. Mention some interesting things you learned from the class and how the
teacher made things easier to understand for you.  
7\. Describe how interested you were about the subject and the class.  
8\. Relate how this subject has later helped you/ influenced you in your
education and learning process.  
9\. Finally give a conclusion by mentioning how beneficial the subject for
students.  
  
**If you pick Math try to focus on the following issues:**  
  
1\. The teacher was very good explaining the intricacies of the subject.  
2\. You learned many theories and formulas of math.  
3\. This teacher explained how math would be helpful for the rest of the life
and academic years.  
4\. You learned the importance of Math for higher study.  
5\. The teacher not only explained the math from the academic book but also
has taken interesting and thought provoking math from other sources.  
  
**If you prefer to talk about Literature say:**  
  
1\. The teacher helped you enjoy the literature.  
2\. S/he told stories of classic literature that you still remember.  
3\. S/he was a gifted story teller and she had been successful creating your
interest on literature.  
4\. You became a good reader because of the classes and the teacher.

Similarly you can talk about any subject that you were interested in your
school level. In your whole conversation you should talk about the subject
itself for about 2 minutes , 1 minutes about the teacher and his/her way of
teaching and for the remaining time say how benefitted you had been from those
classes.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

**Q: Is there any difference between the traditional and modern education systems?**  
**Answer:** I can't really know for sure because I have graduated from school many years ago, but I would try and say that the answer to this question. In the traditional system, teachers are present and have an active role during the class because they do everything on their own. More precisely, verbal communication, interaction and the usage of blackboard are the main elements of this type of system. Books, pens, pencils, lecture and question-answer, written exam and grading are the main ingredients of the traditional education system.  
  
On the contrary, in the modern education system, teachers' role is restricted
as technology does many things instead. With the use of computers and virtual
classrooms, the method of teaching has changes to a great extent in the modern
education system. Projector, online classes, assignments, online learning
system, online exam and assessments are the main ingredients of modern
education system.  
  
I believe that with both types of educational systems, students will be able
to reap benefits as long as they are willing to study in collaboration with
their schoolmasters and academic activities.

**Q: What are the pros and cons of the current educational system in your country?**  
**Answer:**This is an important issue and I can't really be accurate because as I mention before I am not aware of the way schools function these days, but I will answer from my experience so far.  
  
A positive thing is that a combination of traditional and modern education
methods are applied in our education system and this undoubtedly leads to
better results. To illustrate, students are motivated to study and in this way
they develop their cognitive skills, acquire mental capabilities, assimilate
the information provided more easily and they also build a well- rounded
personality. Some other positive sides of our education system is that the
syllabus is updated, the teachers and well trained, the schools have better
learning environment, the education ministry is quite positive about improving
the education sector and use of technology has been widely accepted in our
education sector.  
  
Moving to the downsides, many teachers don't deal with their students as much
as needed and this can cause detrimental effects upon children. Moreover,
better students evaluation, question answering and feedback from students
about teachers are needed to be implemented.

**Q: Do you think it is necessary to give comment or criticism to teachers?**  
**Answer:** I strongly believe that criticizing teachers isn't the appropriate course of action. The best and most effective method is giving comment and making plausible and constructive conversations about the issues that concern parents and students. Everyone should bears in mind that teaching is an amazingly difficult and fundamental occupation and parents should collaborate and interact with teachers and not assail them. Besides, it would be good to think that from the moment that someone chose to become a teacher, they want the best for their students' educational level. 

**Q: How can a teacher make learning more interesting?**  
**Answer:** It's a really interesting and useful question that concerns most of the people, including teachers and parents.  
  
To begin, allow me to say that teachers play the most important role in
teaching and sharing knowledge among students. For example, when I was in my
secondary school, the most difficult subject for me was geography because of
the overwhelming information about the different countries. My schoolmaster
tried to make it more interesting by telling us different things about each
country such us, their brands, monuments, customs and famous people. In this
way, he not only made the subject exciting but also managed to provide us with
the needed information and achieved his goal. Nowadays that technology
constitutes an essential part of everyday life, teachers have the ability and
the opportunity to make things better and more interesting by connecting
students to music, movies and documentaries that are relevant with the study.
It is undoubtedly a really effective way to stimulate students' interest and
imagination.  
  
Personally I think that, passion for teaching, good relationship with
students, telling stories that connects to the lessons and use of technology
can make learning more interesting, engaging and effective.

**Q: Are there any subjects that shouldn’t be taught in school? Why?**  
**Answer:** I don't think that this should happen. My personal belief is that everything that is taught in a school is useful and provides important information to students. Of course there are different types of subjects and among them some of them are more educational and useful and some others not, but I would say that it's subjective and depends on a student's personal aims and objectives. For example, I wanted to be an economist since secondary school and the requisite subjects for this were mathematics, business administration and physics. It was my personal preference but it didn't mean that history, literature and ancient greek should be withdrawn. So, I don't agree with that and I support that all types of subjects should exist in a school curriculum. 

**Q: How can the school help students to overcome a problem with a certain subject? **  
**Answer:** That's an important matter that happens to almost everyone throughout their school years. However, there are some strategies that can be implemented to inhibit this kind of problem. Teacher's attitude is an essential element that helps children change their mindset about a specific subject and see it from another perspective. Schoolmasters should urge their student to deal with this subject and make them understand it by modern methods rather than the conventional ones. Furthermore, they should encourage and not humiliate them in case children can't demystify the information provided. I believe if teachers and the school authority are sincere about helping students who have problems in specific subjects, this will be resolved with the help of reference books, consultancy and technology like internet. 

**Q: Do you think that visiting different websites has benefits for a student?**  
**Answer:** Like any other technology, Internet and websites have both pros and cons for students. However, it is not the problem of the technology itself, rather the one who use it. So, if the students visit websites which are reliable, offers helpful information and study materials, they will definitely benefit from this. From different websites, students are able to read a wide variety of things, but they should make sure that the sites they access are reliable and provide accurate and true information.  
  
On the contrary, if a student visits websites that are not reliable, not
suitable for their age, and offer only entertainment and no education related
materials, then it might be negative for them.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a happy event of your life

**You should say:**

  * what it was
  * when it happened
  * where it happened

**and exaplain why it was a happy event.**

  
**Follow-up Questions:**  
• What do you think is important in achieving happiness?  
• How do you celebrate some happy events?  
• What do the camera and video play in celebrating?

**Possible Answer 1:**  
I can remember many happy events of my life and out of those I would like to
talk about the event that I can still remember vividly regarding my success in
the board exam. The moment I heard that I had been awarded a scholarship based
on my performance in the board exam, I became the happiest man in the world.
This was indeed a very happy moment for me as it is something I was looking
forward to achieve and the news made my parents quite happy and proud.

I spent almost a month with great anxiety regarding my result publication. I
started speculating so many things and many of them were negative. I could
hardly keep away the tensions about my upcoming result. The result was so
important that my college admission was depended on it. I could not sleep well
in the night before the result publishing. I think this is a common anxiety
for students and I was familiar with this type of anxiety. However, this
particular exam results game me more nightmares than any other time of my
life.

The result was published at around 11.00 am and I found that I did
exceptionally well. I was so relieved and happy that I literally shouted. Then
I hurriedly came back to our home and gave the news to my parents. They were
happy too. My father bought sweets and my mother gave it to our neighbours. I
felt excited, happy and relieved. At that time I was about 15 years old. It
happened at our hometown called (_... say the name of your home-town..._)

###  ![Describe a happy event of your
life](/images/IELTS_cue_card/IELTS_Cue_Card_Describe_a_happy_event_of_your_life.jpg)  
Tips for answering this cue card:

"**Describe a happy event of your life**" is an example of cue card topic that
gives a candidate a wide range of options to pick from. You are virtually free
to talk about any event that you think you would be flexible to talk about. On
the contrary the topic like "**Describe a famous writer in your country**"
narrows your option. You can't just pick any writer and start talking about
him. For the later topic you need to think about such a writer and give some
factual information about him.

  
The cue cards that give you wide options are usually easier to talk about
since you won't have to wonder a lot to pick what you would talk about. For
this cue card i.e. "**Describe a happy event of your life**" think about an
event of your life that made you happy. If you take it from your life rather
than making it up, you would be able to give more details and extend the
topic.

  
**Following are some of the ideas you can take as examples of happy events of your life but always try to speak about a real event of your life.**

  
1\. Your father got promoted and your family celebrated it.  
2\. You got admitted to a school/ college/ university where you dreamed to
study.  
3\. The birth of your younger sister/ brother/ nephew/ niece or even your own
kid if you are a father/ mother.  
4\. One of your family members was severely ill but got healed miraculously.  
5\. You won a competition.  
6\. You did something for others and people acclaimed that.  
7\. You got scholarship.  
8\. You overcame one of your obstacles.  
9\. You went to visit a foreign country  
10\. You achieved something noteworthy.  
11\. You saved someone from a big problem.



**Cue Card Answer 2:**  
In my face, I feel a glow whenever I remember the day I went to the
International trade fair with some of my friends. That was my first
International trade fair visit and this was such a happy experience that I
still feel a great joy reciting the memory of this event. It was January, 1998
and that time I was in my first year of college.

  
Till my college I was like a new born lady, who had never visited any places
without her places of her local area. After I got admitted in to the college,
I started exploring the world and the amazing things that invites people like
us. One day I planned with my friends that we would visit International trade
fair. This might seem like a very usual and banal event for others but to me
that was a really exciting thing to do. Later on we did as we thought and
finalized our visit to the fair. After break period at college, we escaped by
back door (As a side note, I would like to mention that I’d no previous record
of escaping school or college before). We were five in members and we hired
taxi to reach the trade fair. There wasn’t enough space to sit in the back
side of the taxi and the taxi driver gave a suspicious look at us. That’s why
with a fishy smile we took the decision that one of us would sit in front of
the baby taxi with the taxi driver. It was a funny decision but there was no
alternative to us and we enjoyed it.



After few minutes we reached at the fair and then collected the tickets. We
were thoroughly enjoying everything we did that time. We entered the fair and
took a deep breath to ease ourselves. We were kind of overwhelmed to observe
the vast area with hundreds of shops and stalls. People were all around us and
we felt like somehow we have come to a fairy land. Wherever we went, I was
feeling so excited, everything was totally new for me as a grown up lady. We
took lots of photos from different views, purchased few interesting things
within our limited budget and roamed in the whole area of the fair. I forgot
my usual area, boundaries and the same thing I do almost every day and felt a
happiness that I missed for a long. We spent almost 4-5 hours in the trade
fair and at last retuned to our home in the evening. We returned home by bus
and I was so happy that I felt like discovering a new continent.



###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. What do you think is important in achieving happiness?**  
**Answer:** I strongly believe that ordinary yet priceless things such as health, family solidarity and closeness, important people like friends who will always be there for you no matter what and job satisfaction can definitely lead to happiness. I am opposed to the belief that money makes everyone happy and replete. Although money and wealth are essential elements for human life as they help people cover their expenses, do things they want, and purchase materials people want, I don't think that they are the determinant factors. Furthermore, self contentment could be another important ingredients for us to be happy. We can be happy with however little we have only if we have the self satisfaction and self contentment. 

**Q. How do you celebrate some happy events?**  
**Answer:** As I can remember, when I was younger I used to held parties at my home solely with my family and relatives. Especially on my birthdays, my mom cooked my favourite foods and made my favourite birthday cake with chocolate. Now that I am not a teenager anymore, I go out with my friends and in some special circumstances with my family as well. For example, on my graduation day I went to a Greek restaurant with my parents, brother and my five best friends and we had a really great time. Generally speaking, I would say that I am more of an introvert person, so I totally prefer to spend substantial time with few friends rather than having many people and typical relationships. My happy moments and celebrations are also related to my friends and family members.  

**Q. What role the camera and video play in celebrating?**  
**Answer:** I would argue that these two tools, camera and video, play an integral part in different types of celebrations. First of all, most people have moments of their childhood and memories from childhood are captured in cameras. To illustrate, some of the most important events such as birthday parties, weddings, graduations and so on are included in these jigs and in this way the moment is captured and saved for a long period of time. Furthermore, as some essential and happy events are recorded, they could be used and displayed years later in order for some people to remember some significant events. A good illustration in my case is that on my 22nd birthday, my friends made me a really emotional video from all the years that we have been friends. Without the usage of the camera and video recorder this could never have happened.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 14 - Describe a museum

sample-14-describe-a-museum&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.

##  Describe a museum that you have visited.

**You should say:**

  * when you visited the museum
  * describe the museum
  * how you felt after going there

**and describe your experience of the visit.**

**Possible Answer: **  
I have visited 5-6 museums in total in different countries and enjoyed
visiting the (tell a museum name you know about) in (say the country name). I
went to the museum 2 years back while visiting the city. Visiting the museum
was not in our tour plan and yet we went there as it was prominently
expressing its present in front of us. I went there with my 2 friends and one
cousin who were my tour partners. My cousin and one of my friends were not at
all interested to roam inside the museum as they had other plans. I insisted
them to go there and convinced them by saying that if you do not enjoy it; I
would pay for the dinner!  
  
After we bought our tickets, we entered in to the museum and the colossal
front side of the museum building and the large open garden in front of it
mesmerized us. At that time I had a feeling that our time would worth the
visit.  
  
After we entered inside the museum, we found that the place is even larger
than we initially thought it would be. There were 5 floors in the museum and
the inside architecture reminded us the imperial age. We could see the top of
the building from the ground flood. People from different age groups and
countries were closely observing the museum. Taking photo was prohibited and
yet I was sometimes allured to take some hidden snaps especially when I saw
the colossal dinosaur fossil and alien ship!  
  
The first floor of the museum had some art from famous artist of the world and
sculptures from different era.  The first floor gave us the impression of
visiting a theatre or art gallery rather than museum. We came to know that
some of the arts were so expensive that one can buy an island by selling it!
Then we moved to the second floor which was full of Second World War memories.
Guns, tanks and other war materials from 1945 WW II had been arranged there. A
video was showing some of the fighting scenes of WW II.  
  
When we reached third floor, it’s been already 2.5 hours. We found all the
costumes and traditional things from different parts of the world have been
placed here. One can easily learn about the customs of different ages and
countries just by visiting this floor. The next floor had more adventure and
surprises for us. It has placed all the major inventions of different ages and
they were historically famous. I felt overwhelmed seeing the First computer,
Speed boat, Wheel, Motor Engine and many more famous invention of history at
this floor. I was so much dying to touch the first 4 wheeler that had been
placed there.  
  
We had visited the whole museum as much as possible and spent almost the whole
day. We were so enthralled to visit the place that we literally forgot to have
our lunch. The overall experience was fantastic and I learned so many things
in few hours. As soon as I left the place, I planned to revisit it someday.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

**Q. How often do you visit museums?**  
**A.** Although I would love to go to museums more often, I have only visited three of them until now and that would make it three times that I have been to museums!  
  
All of them were of archeological type but I still remember the last one- in
Greece. It was the Acropolis Museum and I went there at the age of 16, during
a school programme for the restitution of the Parthenon Marbles which are
located in the British Museum. It is a magnificent building and it reflects
the greek civilization with the inclusion of statues, monuments and even
documentaries with the purpose of informing visitors not only from overseas
but also from Greece about its exhibits. I strongly believe that it was the
best educational experience of my life and I would induce people to pay it a
visit when possible.

**Q. What type of museum is popular in your country?**  
**A.** I come from Greece so I'm going to talk about the type of museums famous there. It is widely known that Greece has a really important culture and history, so there are numerous museums throughout the country. Archaeological and folklore museums are the most common kinds and those are visited by the majority of people. Apart from these, biographical, ethnographic and historic museums are also really rife in our country. Furthermore, there are art museums and galleries and some other that are about industry, science and technology. To conclude, there are plenty of categories that satisfy everyone's preference and desire but Archaeological and folklore museums are most popular in our country. 

**Q. What do you think of the importance of museums in history?**  
**A.** My personal belief is that museums are of paramount importance and constitute an integral part of a country's history. As it is known, these constructions provide information about culture and heritage; in other words, museums keep history alive. To be more precise, museums include artifacts and different objects from the past and by placing them there, people are reassured that the items they see provide clear and accurate information about the history, rather than reading books and magazines in which most of the details are subjective and theoretical. In addition, if I'm allowed to speak in economic terms, I would say that museums are history's brands and trademarks. 

**Q. How do you think of the heritage of a country?**  
**A.** It seems to me that a heritage of a nation isn't determined by only one thing. To begin, monuments, sculptures and temples are essential and they are representative examples as far as heritage is concerned. For example, the Parthenon in Greece, Statue of Liberty in the USA, Hatshepsut's Mortuary Temple and Pyramids in Egypt, Tower of London in the UK are only some the most significant structures that reflect each country's legacy. History composes an important part as well, by informing people about the achievements and failures of a territory and the reason why something is known and studied by many. Lastly, museums which we were talking about earlier couldn't be missing from this list, not only for all the important aspects they have but also because they are connected with the beauty and grandeur of a country. 

**Q. Compare the museums nowadays and in the past.**  
**A.** Anyone who pays a visit to museums could say that nowadays museums are more beautiful, modern, have rich collection, and convenient to visit than in the past. To elucidate, in the past only few people had access to them but these days they are open spaces for public knowledge. Furthermore, much attention is given to the maintenance of the museums now than the past and most of the museums are renovated not only for their preservation but also to attract more public interest. In addition, technological advances have played a fundamental role; with videos and audios helping visitors understand what they see and that makes their experience more pleasant, informative and interactive than the past when these technological usages were absent. 

**Q. Have you ever been to a foreign museum?**  
**A.** The truth is I have never been to a museum outside my country, but I would really like to go someday. The first museum that comes to my mind is the British Museum in the UK and despite the fact that I have been living in England for the last three years, I never managed to visit this renowned institution. Some other museums that I definitely want to visit are the Metropolitan Museum of Art and National Portrait Gallery in the USA and the National Museum of Ireland. 

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card Topic:

While describing a museum you should pick the national stadium of your
country. If you have already visited the museum, you should be comfortable
describing it. Since this is the museum that the examiner might also know
about, you should give the factual information of it. Start by saying when you
visited it, with whom you went there, number of times you went there, the
exterior or interior of the museum, number of floors of the museum, things you
did there, the things present there and so on. If you can't remember an exact
museum try to visualize one and describe the museum as if you have visited it.
If you ever been to a foreign country and visited a museum of that city, you
can also mention that museum. If the cue card topic asks you to describe a
museum in your country, you would then have to describe a museum located at
your country.  
  
**Some of the common features of a museum:**  
1\. A museum is a place where collection of artifacts and other things are
preserved for public exhibition.  
2\. Almost all of the countries have museums in their major cities.  
3\. The things preserved there are generally of scientific, cultural, historic
and artistic interests.  
4\. Things are arranged and categorized on different floors for the
convenience of the visitors.  
  
There are several types of museums based on the types of things they present
for public exhibition and you can talk about any type of museum you like and
know about. General categories of museum are as following:  
  
Cultural museum, historic museum, science and technology museum, craft museum,
fine arts museum, archaeology museum, natural history museum, children’s
museum, modern art museum, military history museum, aviation museum, universal
museum etc.

A botanical garden or a zoological garden is also referred as a museum but
avoid describing one of these two unless you have no clue about the other
types of museum. If you plan to describe a botanical garden or a zoological
garden as a museum, make it clear at the very first level of your speaking so
that the examiner does not have any confusion.

![Cue Card Describe your favorite
Restaurant](/images/IELTS_cue_card/cue_card_sample_2-_Describe_your_favorite_Restaurant.jpg)

**Cue card Answer 1: **   
Thank you very much for giving me the chance to talk about my favourite
restaurant. The name of my favourite restaurant is (say the name of the
restaurant you are going to talk about) and it’s situated at the centre of the
city I am currently living in. Not only I like the spacious, serene
environment, tasty menus that the restaurant serves, but I have lots of
memories related to this restaurant. I remember that my parents celebrated
some of my birthday parties there, our college friends arranged the get-
together parties, one of my cousins’ marriage ceremony was celebrated there
and similarly I attended lots of other parties at this very restaurant.  
  
The restaurant has 3 floors and the sitting arrangement is quite nice.
Paintings of famous artists have been hanging on the walls and the place is
quite neat and clean. The interior decoration is charming and gorgeous
feeling. The ground floor is spacious and can accommodate more than 50 cars'
parking. The front view of the restaurant is different as the place gives the
impression of an urban garden.  
  
The restaurant offers several dishes including exotic desserts, ice-creams and
also offers a separate place for the kids to play and have fun. The prices are
reasonable and the foods are served quickly as opposed to some other
restaurants where you will have to wait for a long for your foods to appear on
your table. The waiters and other staffs are friendly and welcoming. The
restaurant offers Chinese, Italian, Indian, Thai, Pakistani and local menus
that gives you a wide ranges and options to pick from. The soft background
music and instrumentals make the environment more enjoyable and soothing. The
tables are not congested   and people can chat over their personal topics
without interruption. The long glass made windows offer the city view which
makes the place worth visiting besides the delicious foods. The place must be
a good place to be as I often found the foreign tourists visiting the
restaurant. The authority lets the customers provide their feedbacks and
comments on foods and the place and as I have noticed they take prompt action
on a customer complaint.  
  
In short, this is a really nice restaurant to go and enjoy the delicious
meals.

**Cue card Answer 2: **  
Today I am going to talk about my favourite restaurant.  Where it is, what it
looks like, the kinds of food it serves and why it is so special to me.

My favourite restaurant is in England!  It is actually in the suburbs of the
city of Sheffield which is where I live.  The restaurant is on a busy street
very near to a large park.  It is quite a small and hectic place called
Jonty’s because Jonty is the name of the person who set up the business.

From the outside the restaurant doesn’t look very impressive.  It has large
glass windows at the front, and some benches outside for people to sit on if
they are waiting to go in.  There used to be a large sign with the name of the
restaurant written on it in big letters, but recently they have taken down the
sign and not yet replaced it!  Inside there are lots of square wooden tables,
each with about four chairs around them.  The restaurant is on two levels, I
prefer to go upstairs to the first floor, because there you can sometimes get
a window seat and enjoy watching people as they go past in the street outside.

The restaurant serves mainly breakfast and lunch meals.  It does really good
coffee – I like their latte’s best – and lots of sandwiches, salads and
special soups.  The restaurant also has a selection of delicious, gooey home-
made cakes.  However, when I go, I always have the same thing – scrambled egg
on wholemeal toast with mushrooms, because that is what I like best!

The restaurant is very special to me and my friends because we meet their
every Saturday.  On Saturday’s about 500 people go to the local park for 9.00
in the morning to take part in a 5 km run.  Afterwards, I like to go to
breakfast at Jonty’s with three of my best friends.  We feel we deserve a big
breakfast after our run, and we enjoy catching up with each other’s news over
a leisurely meal together.

So if ever you are in Sheffield, I hope you will find Jonty’s and enjoy it as
much as I do.

**Cue card Answer 3: **  
'Dine-excellence' is the largest restaurant in our city and this is my
favourite restaurant. This restaurant offers a great dining experience and the
view, both inside and outside, is quite spectacular. This is a beautiful
restaurant with great price and clean environment. I often go to this
restaurant to enjoy my dinner with my wife or with my friends.  
  
It is a four storied restaurant and the 2nd floor is reserved for different
parties or special events. The playground for children is quite large and
children enjoy playing there. As a good number of toys are places there,
children get busy to play with them and parents can look after them from a
distance. The roof-top is my personal favourite as it gives a very clear view
of the adjacent nature and the clear blue sky. If it is not raining, I like to
enjoy my dinner at the roof-top. The interior decoration of this restaurant is
something that makes it stand out of the crowd. The soft music, delicious menu
and well-mannered and prompt staffs make it a worth visiting place for food
lovers.  
  
The variety of dishes this restaurant offers is another great thing about it.
Someone will find almost any local or famous foreign menu there and the expert
cooks make the food tasty and worth enjoying. Interestingly the price of the
food in this restaurant is comparatively cheaper and that's the main reason I
love this restaurant. Many other people also think that this restaurant offers
great service, tasty dishes and good dining experience at a cheaper price.
There are some other restaurants that offer nice dishes and good services, but
the price of their menu is quite high.  
  
The weekly music concert and discount for regular customers are two other
reasons I like it more than other restaurants in my city. Probably people who
come here regularly also like these facts. I was very surprised to get even
40-50% discount in few occasions and they told me that this was their way of
rewarding loyal customers. I would recommend anyone in this city to enjoy the
delicious menu this restaurant offers and I am sure mt of them would like it.

2\. Describe a place you would recommend your friends to visit.  
3\. Describe a party centre you went recently.  
4\. Describe a restaurant you recently visited.  
5\. Talk about a place where you often meet your friends.  
6\. Describe a restaurant that you enjoyed going to.**

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q: Which one is better: home-made foods or foods from restaurant? **  
**Answer:** This question is really enticing. It seems to me that home-made food is healthier; of course because you are completely responsible for its preparation and you know exactly the ingredients that are included. For example, you are aware of the quantity of salt, olive oil, sugar, pepper et cetera. On the other hand, food at restaurants is undoubtedly more delicious and satiating, but it isn't as wholesome as the former. These types of foods are high in saturated fats and oils and they aren't easily digestible. So I would argue that restaurant food is tastier but home-made food is healthier. Moreover, foods from restaurant are quite costly while home-made foods are not. 

**Q: What traditional foods do you have in your country?  
Answer:** For the last three years I have been living in the UK but I am a
native of Greece so I would like to talk about Greek traditional foods. Greek
cuisine is renowned worldwide and not without a reason. First and foremost we
have the famous Greek souvlaki combined with tzatziki. This is the first food
that anyone who comes to Greece wants to taste. Going further, there is the
Greek mousakas which is a really tasty dish and it consists of potatoes,
eggplants, minced beef and cream. Similar to mousakas, pastitsio is equally
delicious with some variations. There are many other foods, but I think that
those I have already mentioned are the ''landmark'' of the Greek diet.

_**Tip:**_ You can write about your local foods, food of your own country. You
can see some examples below:

**England:** fish and chips, different kinds of meat pies such as kidney, cottage, steak and pork pies, black peas, scotch eggs, roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.  
**Italy:** pizza, spaghetti, breadsticks, aquacotta, carbonara, tortellini.  
**France:** soupe à l'oignon, boeuf bourguignon, flamiche, ratatouille.  
**Germany:** doner kebab, currywurst, wiener schnitzel, kasespatzle.  
**USA:** pancakes, club sandwich, cheeseburger, macaroni and cheese, pumpkin and apple pie. 

**Q: What are the tourist attractions in your city?**  
Answer: I live in Hatfield which is 30 km north of London and there are many
things tourists can see and do there. Firstly, it is really worth seeing
Hatfield House which is on the eastern side of the town. Secondly, Mill Green
Museum and watermill, Hatfield Park Farm and Hatfield Public Library are
places that someone should visit without a doubt. Finally, University of
Hertfordshire and The Galleria Outlet Shopping are some good and interesting
structures for everyone.

_**Tip:**_ Think of your city's attractions and try to tell a few things about
them. For example, you can talk about libraries, universities, monuments,
museums, temples or even some locations that are preferred by many when they
visit your city.

![Describe an accident you
saw](/images/IELTS_cue_card/IELTS_Cue_Card_Describe_an_accident_you_saw.jpg)

**Possible Answer 1:**  
The most devastating accident that I have ever seen is the one that I
witnessed near (say the name of the place) while a train smashed a passing
bus. I saw accident almost 4 years back and yet I can remember the event
clearly. I was on my way to home from the capital city that I’m currently
residing in. There is a train pass in the road and our bus stopped at the
signal. I was busy reading a magazine in the bus and all of a sudden I heard a
loud blasting sound and I looked through the window. What I saw was
unbelievable: The quickly passing train has hit a bus that was trying to pass
the train road. The bus had been thrown away like a toy and we could hear the
unbearable screaming of victims. Lots of people have gathered the place and
the train was passing slowly. People became speechless on the effect of the
devastating accident. I could see people were trying to help the wounded
people and 2-3 ambulances reached there after 15 minutes. The bus driver was
blamed for the incident and I heard that he was dead too. We could not move on
from the place as a huge jam occurred. The wounded people were moved to nearby
hospitals and medical centers and the dead people were placed in a nearby
field. The entire place became a gloomy area and people mourned on the event.
I started feeling sick and tried to help the wounded people.  
  
I have witnessed more than 30 people were lying dead and their relatives were
crying and mourning heavily. I left the place after 8/9 hours and could not
think anything else. The whole event occurred in a few minutes and the effect
was devastating. I had spent nearly 2 weeks in a hallucination and thought a
lot about the people who died there and about their relatives. It came to my
mind that, our life is hanging on the cliffs and we are so helpless sometimes
deciding our fates.

**Describe an accident you saw (funny)**

**Model Answer 2:  **  
The idea of an accident sounds like it should be bad.  But sometimes accidents
are quite comical to watch and if nobody is hurt then I think it is OK to
laugh.

I’m going to tell you a story about an accident I saw a very, very long time
ago, but I can remember it really well, you’ll find out why in a bit…  I’ll
explain where the accident took place, where I was, a bit of detail about the
incident and how it affected me.

The accident took place in a large old house that was in very poor repair.  I
was unemployed at the time, and was sharing the house with a few friends who
were also job-seeking as we had all just finished at university.  It was in
the 1980s and it was very difficult to get work in the UK at that time. We had
chosen the house because it was really cheap.  The way it was set out wasn’t
very safe, there was a tiny kitchen on a stair well that we all had to share,
and this meant that many of our communal chats took place sitting on the
stairs gathered around the landing.

On this particular day it was first thing in the morning.  We were all half
asleep and stumbling around just in our dressing gowns or nightwear.  I was
sat at the top of the stairs (near to the kitchen) waiting to use the kitchen
as one of my friends, Gill, had got in their first and there wasn’t room for
both of us.  Another of our house mates appeared at the bottom of the stairs
and sat there looking tearful and crestfallen.  She had had a terrible
argument with her boyfriend and was very upset.  Gill, who was already in the
kitchen, kindly offered to make her a cup of tea – but as she was putting the
kettle on she was distracted by the tears of our upset mutual friend.  Gill
turned to talk to her just as she was lighting the gas – catastrophe!  The
flame caught her dressing gown and the next moment the whole garment seemed on
fire.  I gasped, my tea-making friend thought quickly, she ripped off her
clothes, and rolled on the floor, tumbling down the stairs ending up in a
naked heap at the feet of our crying companion.  The shock of this sight
caused the sobs to stop.  ‘Why are you at the bottom of the stairs and why
have you got no clothes on?’ queried our now no-longer crying friend.  Me and
my friend Gill just laughed uproariously, partly with relief (it could have
been a lot worse) and partly with disbelief.  Our upset friend had been so
preoccupied with her own worries she’d missed the entire thing.  We couldn’t
believe it when it was all so dramatic.

How did the accident affect me?  It just made me laugh a lot at the time, and
even now when I remember it I do so with a smile.  It was such a ridiculous
thing to happen, and it certainly broke the rather serious mood the morning
had started with.  I also think we were very lucky, it might not have ended
that way.  There is a saying that ‘all’s well that ends well’ – that was
certainly the case here.

Perhaps it isn’t true to say that no-one was hurt in this story, I think that
maybe pride was hurt quite a bit, but it was a long time ago and the main
‘victim’ of this story, Gill, still laughs about it with me now!

####  Describe an accident you saw (serious)

**Model Answer 3:  **  
Wow, talking about an accident I saw is quite challenging!  I can think an
example, but it wasn’t nice to witness.  I’ll tell you where the accident
occurred and where I was at the time, a bit of extra detail about what
happened, and then finally I’ll tell you what happened.  That seems a logical
way to explain it.

The accident took place in the outdoor arena of a large horse riding school,
where I was sharing a jumping lesson with a friend.  The backdrop to where it
took place is really beautiful, as the equestrian centre is set in a rural
location in the picturesque countryside of Glossop, which is within an area
known as the High Peaks in the county of Derbyshire, England.

My friend and I both wanted to improve our technique show jumping.  I’m quite
an experienced rider, but not very confident jumping – I prefer flat work, my
friend is a great athlete, but new to horse riding, she was very confident,
but not very experienced.  We had warmed up already, riding our horses around
under the guidance of an instructor at walk, trot and canter.  We’d taken the
horses over some low cross-poles, which are small jumps you commonly use when
you are teaching either a horse or rider to jump so they can gain confidence.
About 15 minutes into the lesson, we started to take it in turns to try
slightly bigger fences, but nothing too challenging.  I’d already taken my
horse over, and it was my friend’s turn to try.  So I was sat on my horse
watching her as she rode towards the fence.  The instructor and I were both
very calm, as was my friend, it was a small cross pole, and nothing she and
the horse hadn’t done before.

She trotted her pony to the jump, but then at the last minute, her mount just
stumbled, literally tripping over the poles.  Perhaps because my friend was a
bit inexperienced, it caused her to lose her balance, the teacher and I both
gasped, and then laughed as she seemed to recover herself and ended up back in
the saddle… Unfortunately, we relaxed too soon, the horse seemed to still have
her feet in a knot and so tripped again, this time the forward momentum
catapulted my friend into the air.  We watched in slow motion as she went up
in a huge arc, and then fell towards the ground.  Unfortunately, her instinct
was to put her hand out to break her fall, this meant her arm was completely
extended and she took the full weight of her body onto just one hand.  We
heard a sickening split as the bones in her lower arm broke, and it was very
obvious that she had a serious injury.  She was still conscious, but in an
awful lot of pain.

You never quite know how you will behave in an accident.  I went into very
calm mode, I quickly dismounted and caught the loose horse, who was a bit
confused about what had happened.   The instructor called an ambulance, and I
took the horses back to the yard, explained what had  happened, and arranged
for people to stand at various points on the property to help direct the
ambulance to where it was needed before going back to the school.
Unfortunately, the instructor was rather squeamish, she couldn’t bear the
sight of blood and so although she was handling the situation well, she
couldn’t really look at my friend.  So I sat near her and tried to keep her
talking while we all waited for the ambulance.  We knew it was very important
she didn’t move in case she had broken her back as well, and we were trying to
keep her conscious so it would be possible for the paramedics to assess her
more easily when they came.

The ambulance took a very, very long time to arrive because of our remote
location.  However, when they came they were fantastic.  They gave my friend a
lot of morphine – which is a very powerful pain killer – and were incredibly
calm.  I had to help roll her onto the stretcher, but we were very relieved
when she went off to hospital safely.  Her arm was very badly damaged.  She
has had lots of operations and I’m not sure if she will be riding again!

The accident affected me quite a lot, because I was astounded that she was so
unlucky in how she fell.  The horse just tripped, it wasn’t being naughty or
difficult, and it all happened in slow motion so right up until the last
minute I thought she might be alright.  I was pleased how well me and the
instructor worked together to get help, and that I’d been able to stay calm
and focused at the time.  Since then I have jumped again, but really I think
I’ve decided to stick to flat work (dressage) from now on.  Watching an
accident makes you realise how fragile life can be and how easily and quickly
you can be hurt, not through being stupid, but just through being unlucky.

points from the below list to describe this cue card:  
  
1\. It was a car accident/ bus accident/ train accident.  
2\. You were just passing by/ were in another transport while the accident

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. What should be done to reduce the road accident?**  
**Answer:** In my opinion, awareness and responsibility are the two most important things to tackle this crucial matter. In particular, by raising awareness people will become well-informed and it might lead to decline in car and other types of road accidents. This could occur with the intervention by governing bodies, family, school and even campaigns. Accountability is also an essential characteristic. There are many cases, especially in Europe, when people go out and drink and after that they drive back home on their own. Terrible accidents are happening under the influence of alcohol and we should underline that most of the time not only drunk drivers are getting killed but also sober drivers and innocent people are becoming victims who are in the wrong place at the wrong time. Therefore, we all should get informed about conscious driving and be mature because this is all about human life.  
  
Apart from that, roads and traffic system should be improved and the accident
prone roads should be reconstructed. Driving offenses should be taken
seriously and rigid tests and checking should be in place before awarding
someone with the permission to drive.

****Q. **Who should be responsible for the accidents?**  
****Answer:** **First and foremost, drivers have a great responsibility for any accident. Many factors such as alcohol, fake driving license, excessive speed, and lack of road safety contribute to the dramatic increase of road accidents. However, drivers are aware of these considerations so there is a matter of irresponsibility and whoever drives a car should be more responsible. In addition, parents play an important role as well, because they allow their children to drive despite the fact that they're underage and incapable of driving safely and consciously. Furthermore, there are some cases where the accidents are caused by faulty mechanism of cars. These cases aren't that common, but when it happens, the fatal is inevitable. So car manufacturers and distributors in some cases should be responsible as well. 

****Q. **What losses do you think occur when an accident happen?  
****Answer:** ****The most dangerous thing that happens in an accident is the loss of human lives. Due to unpleasant and unexpected accidents, many people pass away and this is the most terrible thing that could  happen. Going further, the victims of road accidents often suffer minor or heavy injuries and the latter entails a long time of hospitalization, with potential permanent damages. Vehicle damage is a further loss, as in most cases cars, motorcycles and all the other vehicles involved, end up completely mangled. Furthermore the family members of the victims suffer from unbearable losses and the outcome often brings catastrophe to those family members. 

[Part three question answers were written by **Mary, UK**]

**Some similar cue card topics that can be answered in a similar fashion:**

**1\. Describe a bad experience you have.  
2\. Describe an experience you have that you wish you did not have.  
3\. Talk about a road accident you know about.  
4\. Describe something terrible you witnessed.  
5\. Describe a car accident you saw.**

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a newspaper or a magazine.

**You should say:**

  * What it is and why you read it
  * What are the benefits of reading a newspaper or a magazine
  * How often you read it and what are the contents of it

**and explain why do you like reading this newspaper or magazine.**  
  
**Follow-up Questions:**  
• What do you think are the important qualities for a news reporter?  
• What's the main difference between newspaper and magazine?  
• What’s the function of a report to the society?  
• What kinds of books/newspapers/magazines do adolescents read in your
country?  
• With the popularity of Internet, do you think newspapers and magazines will
disappear?

**Possible Answer:**  
I read newspaper almost every day and sometimes I purchase or borrow magazines
to read as well. I'd like to describe a magazine that I usually buy each month
and enjoy reading a lot. The name of this magazine is PC World which is a
global computer magazine published monthly by IDG in USA. It offers advice on
various aspects of PCs and related items, the Internet, and other personal-
technology products and services. In each publication, PC World reviews and
tests hardware and software products from a variety of manufacturers, as well
as other technology related devices such as still and video cameras, audio
devices and televisions.

I have been reading this magazine for the last 6-7 years or so. It is
specifically useful for people who love computers, other technology devices;
software and IT related news and updates. I am doing my graduation in Computer
Science and Engineering and love to learn about new hardware and software.
This is a magazine that offers great hardware &amp; software reviews, tips on
advanced computing and many other useful articles.



Reading a newspaper or a magazine is always helpful for learning new
information. Newspapers provide contemporary local news, international news,
editorials, entertainment, news, sports news and so on. Without reading
newspapers or magazines one can't keep himself / herself updated with the
latest news and views of the world. I purchase the PC World magazine every
month and read it for about 7 days. Sometimes I read older versions as well to
find out any particular reviews or articles. This magazine is helpful for
basic, moderate and advanced computer users and techno lovers. Someone who has
a computer should read it to increase his/ her knowledge on hardware and
software. Even it’s helpful for those who are going to buy computers,
printers, cameras, scanners, software or other hardware devices. I enjoy
reading it a lot.

**Sample Answer 2:**  
Today I’m going to talk about one of my favourite magazines.  It’s quite fun
to think about it, first I’ll tell you what it is and why I read it.  Then
I’ll try and persuade you of the benefits of doing so, and a bit about how
often I read it and what the contents are.  Finally, I’ll explain why I like
to read it so much.

The magazine is called ‘**Women’s Running**’.  It’s a monthly publication,
dedicated to helping female runners, at every level to improve their running
and learn more about the sport.

For me the benefits of reading this periodical are huge.  It has great
information about running techniques and nutrition; advertising features on
new running related products; helpful articles on topics like ‘how to choose
new trainers’ and advice on running events and how to prepare for them.  That
is great in itself, but even more importantly for me, it contains lots of
human interest stories.  Real women talking about their experiences of
running, why they do it and how they stay motivated, keep positive and enjoy
the sport.

Even though I do like the magazine, it is really expensive, it’s £4 a time, so
I’m embarrassed to admit I don’t buy my own copy.  Instead, I have a friend
who subscribes to it regularly.  Every few months she has a big clear out, and
she drops off a great big bag of magazines for me to read.  I then have a
binge of reading about running – which is a bit ironic really, I should be out
doing it rather than reading about it!  So I don’t read it each month, but
every few months I’ll have a whole weekend curled up on the sofa avidly
soaking up every article.  I read each copy from cover to cover.  I like the
personal accounts best.  Women talking about perhaps over-coming injuries and
illness to keep on running; forming friendships and achieving goals they never
thought possible.  It can be really inspirational!  It makes me believe that I
too can do more than I think.  Once I’ve read all the magazines I keep them
for a while to refer back to, but eventually I too need to de-clutter, so I’ll
pass them on to another running friend, and so the cycle continues!

Through reading the magazine I’ve started to think of myself more as part of
the ‘running community’ whatever that means!  I’ve started to realise that not
everyone who takes part in running is choosing to do ultra-marathons, we can
all run at our own level and still get the fitness and social benefits at
whatever level you are at.  The main competition is not with other people but
with yourself, other runners can support and help you whether that’s with
advice on how to up your speed or distances to get a new Personal Best or
agreeing to go out with you on a wet and windy night when really the sofa
looks a great deal more appealing than a rain soaked pavement in winter!

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card Topic:

To answer this cue card, first decide if you are going to talk about a
newspaper or a magazine. If you want to talk about a newspaper, decide which
one you would like to talk. For the magazine you should finalize the magazine
name also. Deciding a particular newspaper or magazine would help you focus on
the features and characteristics of it.  There are some differences between a
daily newspaper and a magazine.  
  
**If you decide to talk about the magazine focus on following points:**  
  
**a)** What type of magazine it is: weekly, monthly etc.  
**b) **what's it about: Lifestyle, technology, fun, business travel, fashion etc.  
**c)** For magazine describe the topics and issues it covers. Like a computer magazine covers the software and hardware reviews, tips on computing, tutorials, and price list etc. whereas a fashion magazine highlights the current trends in fashion, new arrivals and focus on brands.  
**d)** Why do I read it? Entertainment, tutorials, academic or professional benefits, new recipes etc.  
**e)** Why this magazine is better than similar other magazines? Article presentation, economic, has subscription facility, exclusive etc.

  
If you talk about a newspaper focus on their news presentation, editorial and
overall contribution to help people get unbiased and quality news and
articles.  
Since, almost all the daily newspapers cover same type of news i.e. political,
sports, editorial, international, business etc. you should focus less on the
type of news they present. Rather emphasize what makes it a worth reading
newspaper.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. What do you think are the important qualities for a news reporter?**  
**Answer:** First and foremost, one of the essential characteristics a news reporter should have is passion for his work.  Academic training would be another important aspects to become a great news reporter. Next, if a news reporter has tertiary education, their knowledge will be broader and they will be specialized in the field of the news exclusively. Furthermore, experience in news agency is an important element as this factor is indispensable in every occupation and many times lead to better results. In addition, being objective, curious, passionate to excel, motivated to do something better  for people are some other important qualities of a professional news reporter. Finally, being able to judge information received on different subjects and not misinterpreting facts are two other qualities that every news reporter should have. 

**Q. What's the main difference between a newspaper and a magazine?**  
**Answer:** It's a really difficult question because as readers, people often think that these two are almost the same. But if we examine deeply, we will see that there are some differences indeed. First, newspapers contain short articles on current news and events and they are mostly daily and sometimes weekly publication. Magazines on the other hand, include longer articles on a variety of subjects and are weekly or monthly publication. Apart from these differences, there are some minor differences as well. For instance, magazines are smaller in size than newspapers and usually more expensive. Newspapers contain fresher contents than magazines. In addition, magazines are like a book while a newspaper is much larger in size though there is lesser number of pages than in a magazine. So we could conclude that although these two forms of print media look like the same, there are many differences between them. 

**Q. What's the function of a report to the society?**  
**Answer:** A report is any useful informational made with the specific intention of relaying information or recounting certain events in a widely presentable form. With regards to the function of a report, we could say in brief that it is multifunctional. Initially, it should provide information on what has to be done or needs to be done. Moreover, reports are used for keeping track of information and this action results in making decisions. Hence, they are used in different fields such as the government, business, education, science, and so on and they can be divided into categories with annual, book, demographic, inspection, military and police reports being the most know types. 

**Q. What kinds of books/newspapers/magazines do adolescents read in your country?**  
**Answer:** Puberty is a transitional period of life so most of children's hobbies and pastimes change during this time. As far as my country is concerned, I think that girls at adolescence read gossip and fashion magazines and novels with mainly romantic plot. Regarding boys, they read sports magazines most of the time, but there are some of them who read novels as well. When I was a teenager, my peers used to read Harry Potter books and as far as I can remember they were a mainstream.    
  
**_Tip: _**Adolescents in different countries read different kind of books, newspapers or magazines. Just talk about the most popular types in your country. For example you can say that boys read sports magazines, sci-fi, poetry, mystery and adventure books. With reference to girls, you can mention that they mostly read literature, romance, contemporary and beauty magazines, magazines and books about relationships.



**Q. With the popularity of Internet, do you think newspapers and magazines will disappear?**  
**Answer:** That's a controversial yet important issue to discuss about. Some people believe that magazines and newspapers will continue to be publicized irrespective of Internet's rapid progress. The way we are accustomed to read a hard copy of a newspaper or a magazine will never get lost. The appeal of reading something printed is in our blood and it would not fade away very soon. However, it is undeniable that a large number of people would read it in a computer or a handheld device. There are many really large news and magazine companies that were established many years ago and they employed many workers. If printed newspapers and magazines disappear, all these corporations will automatically go bankrupt and thousands of people will be unemployed. My personal belief is that as the Internet is constantly advancing, the publication of the press will be restricted to some extent and all the major newspaper and magazine companies will have their online versions for readers. I can see for myself that I prefer reading the news online rather than buying newspapers, but that does not mean that I never buy a magazine or a newspaper to read it.

![Describe a book
](/images/IELTS_cue_card/IELTS_Cue_Card_Describe_a_book_.jpg)

**Possible Answer 1:**  
Whenever I get time, I try to read books and the ranges vary from profession
related books, technical, religious, fiction, classic and contemporary books.
The book I would like to describe is a novel called ‘**Kane and Abel**’ and is
written by the famous British writer Jeffrey Archer. Sometimes I read book
reviews on internet and after reading 2/3 books by Jeffrey archer, I tried to
get the list of all books by Jeffrey Archer. I found that most of the Jeffrey
Archer fans have recommended the book ‘Kane &amp; Abel’. Some people even
commented that this is the best book ever written by the same author. I made
my mind at this very moment to read this book. After one month or so, I bought
the book from a book store and started reading it.

The book was first published in 1979 in the United Kingdom and in USA in 1980.
The book was the international success and reached No. 1 position on the New
York Times best-selling book list. The story-line started with the birth of
two infants named Kane and Abel in the year 1906. One of them was born to a
life of prosperity and eases in USA in a rich family while the other one to a
world of hardship and struggle. On different sides of the Globes, they grew
up: one shaped by a luxurious upbringing, fine schooling and history he read,
the other one who lost his mother at the time of his birth and did not know
who his father was, well tempered by war, slavery and history he was part of.
The story telling of Jeffrey Archer is magical and enchanting. Most of his
story simply mesmerizes the readers and for Kane and Abel the attraction
worked even more. Every page I turned tempted me to read further. Not for a
single moment I could have stop thinking about the events and characters of
the books and that had a major influence on me. The characters have their own
charismatic powers and followed their own paths. One is gold, meritorious
while the other one is steel and have forfeited the Dead himself. On their
journey in life, they confront each other and became the ultimate adversary of
each other. In their relentless battle, both men knew that there could be only
one victor- and one vanquished.  
  
Across three generations and around a rapidly changing world, their war rages
unchecked, for the love of a dream, the loss of an empire, and the lure of a
fortune. Kane became the owner of the largest bank in USA while Abel came to
USA as a penniless emigrant after the World War I. With intelligence Kane
started flourishing the banking business, while Abel made his fortune at last
in Hotel business. The first time they confronted each other as a bank owner
and a debtor. Though Kane wanted to help Abel regain his business by financing
further, but could not do so because of the bank’s board members’ decision.
After that Abel considered Kane as his greatest enemy and sought to destroy
Kane. As time passed both had to fight their own fates but the vendetta
remained on their hearts. When both men finally grew older, their son and
daughter fell in love and got married. They never agreed on the marriage
because of their personal hatred of each other. Abel succeeded to buy the bank
stocks of Kane’s Bank to hold the power to veto Kane. At the end of the story
both confronted each other for the second and last time. After that Kane died
and after his death, Abel learned that it was Kane who backed him financially
to start his hotel business. The story was told like a magician and is a
powerful portrait of a world and two men that a reader would never forget.

**Alternative Answer 2:**  
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk about a book that had a major
influence on me.  I am going to tell you the name of the book and the author,
what I remember of it and why it is so significant to me.

Funnily enough I was thinking about this book only the other day.  It is
called ‘**The Adventures of the Little Wooden Horse**’, I don’t know why I
remembered it suddenly, but I had to google to look up the author.  It is by
Ursula Moray Williams, but I didn’t know that when I first read it.

As to how I first heard of the book, I can’t really say!  It is actually a
children’s book, and I think it must have been chosen for me by my parents as
I don’t remember actually buying it with anyone, and I don’t think it was a
birthday gift or it would have had an inscription in its front cover.  The
copy I had was a rather tatty paper back with an orange cover and published by
a then famous book company called Puffin Books.  It had a picture of crudely
fashioned toy wooden horse on the front.  The horse had a cylindrical body and
straight legs fastened onto a board with four wheels on it.  The horse had a
flowing mane and tail, and in my copy was facing away from the reader, heading
off on its’ adventures.

The story was so very sad!  The horse in the title was a toy horse originally
supposed to be sold by his maker.  The little wooden horse is very loyal and
wants only to stay with his Uncle Peder who crafted him.  However, sadly the
toymaker is forced out of business as mass produced toys become available, and
the little wooden horse sets out to try and make his fortune so the two of
them can stay together.  Terrible things happen to the horse, he is sometimes
lonely and unhappy. Eventually though, he does make his fortune (I can’t
remember how) and returns home only to find the toymaker has vanished! It is
heart-breaking.  In the end the little wooden horse and the toy maker are
reunited by chance and there is at last a happy ending after a harrowing set
of adventures.

The reason this book is important to me is because it is the first book I
remember really wanting to read for myself.  My mum and dad would take turns
to read me just one chapter at night, but there were lots and lots of chapters
– about twenty I think, and I was so upset not knowing how the story would end
if one chapter was finished and the poor little wooden horse was left in
distress!  I could read a bit, but not that well, and not well enough to read
silently in my head.  Anyway, one night, after my parents had closed the book
and left me alone, I carried on reading all by myself.  I had to read out
loud, and the story was so sad I was sobbing as I read, which made it even
harder for me to get the words out and finish the story.  Even so, I carried
on reading right to the end and fortunately the story did end happily!  I can
still remember this, even though I must have only been about four years old at
the time.  My parents remember the episode too.  They could hear me in my room
reading aloud and crying, and they said it was heart-rending to listen to, but
also quite impressive, as I was so stubbornly determined to do this, and on my
own.

I have never re-read the book as an adult.  I’m afraid if I did and found it
wasn’t really very good or very well written it might spoilthe memory for me.
I prefer to imagine it as the most brilliant story ever written even if that
isn’t true at all!  So the book is special because it is probably the book
that encouraged me to read, as well as being probably my earliest memory.

**Alternative Answer 3:**  
The book that tremendously influenced me in my college level is titled
"**Pather Panchali**" by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay. This book was published
in 1929 and later a movie was made with the same title by Satyajit Ray. The
book is a tragedy and family drama which is considered to be one of the finest
literary works in Bengali literature.  
This book deals with the life, happiness, sadness and inner-picture of Roy
family in a rural area. Later they moved to a different place in search of a
better life but they had to face great deal of anguish and loss during their
travel to a new transition.  
  
The book describes the rural life, the people of this rural place, their
sufferings, their joys, the beautiful country-side, green fields, paddy-
fields, flowers and many more things that become alive in the story. The story
line, the mastery of story-telling ability, the scenic beauty of rural area,
the tragic death of a touchy character all were so profoundly expressed that I
was deeply touched. Moreover this book was written by one of the superior
writer who has a talent to describe the rural beauty in a style that no other
writer can do.  
  
The book reminded me rural are I had once been. It was like travelling to the
past in a time machine. Bibhutibhushan is a gifted writer and probably the
best of his type. He had an ability to depict the rural life and scenic beauty
profoundly and perfectly. The characters of his books come from ordinary
places and lead ordinary lives, but the impression they create in readers'
mind is extraordinary.  


####  **Tips for answering this cue card sample: **

This cue card asks you to talk about a book you have read. You should pick a
book that you know well. Let's say you have read a book which was very
interesting but you have forgotten the name of the author or the publisher,
you can't tell the story in an organised fashion, then you should not talk
about that one. Rather pick a book which is interesting, you have read and you
know the writer and story of the book. If you are not sure of such a book,
think about one, google for the details of the book and remember the following
information about the book:  
  
1\. Writer.  
2\. Publisher.  
3\. Publishing year.  
4\. Some other book names by the same author.  
5\. Story of the book.  
6\. Why the book was critically acclaimed.  
7\. Some characters of the book.

For the part why this book has a great influenced on you mention some of the
following points:  
  
1\. The book was written by a writer who has a great way of telling a story.  
2\. The story is a page turner and you had hard time keeping it away.  
3\. You have learned an important lesson from this book.  
4\. The characters of this book gave you great impression.  
5\. Some of the trivia and facts about the book. etc.

###  Necessary vocabulary for this cue card:

**Related to describing a book:** Hardcover, best seller, novel, paperback, recommended book, page-turner, plot, fiction, avid reader, bookworm, genre, biography, literary, contemporary, fast-paced,  gripping, to borrow, compelling plot, fascinating characters. 

**Synonyms of 'major': **Significant, important, serious, paramount, prime, great, outstanding, considerable. 

**Synonyms of 'influence': **Effect, impact, consequence, force, significance. 

**If you prepare for this cue card, you should also be able to answer the following cue card topics:**  
  
** 1\. Describe a book you have recently read.  
2\. Describe your favourite book.  
3\. Describe a book you read and remember.  
4\. Talk about a book you enjoyed reading.  
5\. Describe a book you would recommend your friends to read.  
6\. Talk about a book your one of your friends recommended you.  
7\. Describe a worth reading book.**

Since the cue card topic is asking to describe a book that has a major
influence on you, not necessarily you have to talk about a story book. You can
pick any academic book, religious book or specific subject or technology
related books as well.  
  
For instance if you pick the major book of your religion, you can say how it
has changed your view of life and world. How it had helped you learning
morality and humanity and religious lessons that you follow in your life.
There are so many things we learn from our religion and you can talk about
these.  
  
If you pick an academic book, let’s say JAVA programming language book,
Introduction to business or Accounting you can tell how this book has changed
your view on this specific subject and created a solid base on the subject and
influenced you to later study on that subject further.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. How often do you read books?**  
**Answer: **Unfortunately, I don't read books very often. When I was younger my mom used to tell me stories from different books so this is the reason that I am aware of the fairytales. The only book I have read is 'Twilight' by Stephenie Meyer when I was 15 years old and the motivation to do that was the movie with the same name which was released in 2008. From another perspective though, I read almost all of my books when I was at university but I was forced to do that. So I would come to the conclusion that, I don't read books in my free time but only when I have to. 

_**Tip:**_ You can either say that you don't or you do read books. If you are
in the first category refer to the reasons why you don't do that. For example,
you can say that you don't have time, many interesting books are expensive,
you can't read online books because it's tiring and anything else comes to
your mind.

If you are in the second category, just think of the kinds of books you have
read and try to describe them in a few words. You can also include your
university books.

**Q. How books can impact on a man's life?  
Answer:** Books are good sources of knowledge and they actually enlighten us.
Reading a book is a really good and helpful way whenever you are bored or
stressed out. It is preferable to me reading a book than to surfing the
internet. Going further, in this way people can develop their imagination and
nurture their mind and thinking skills. Moreover, there is a possibility for
someone to change their view about specific things such as religious issues,
gender parity, culture and so on and become more open-minded by reading books.
For instance, somebody who isn't romantic may change his opinion after reading
a book with a romantic story or someone who is narrow-mined and biased may
change their attitude. Finally, it's a good and effective way to practice a
foreign language and this is something I did before coming to England.

**Q. Name some of the famous writers of your country?  
Answer:** Answer: One of the most famous English writers is JK Rowling, the
author of the Harry Potter fantasy series. Her books have gained worldwide
attention, won multiple awards, and were sold more than 400 million copies so
far. John Milton whose poetry has been seen as the most perfect poetic
expression in the English language for four centuries is also from my country.
Agatha Christie who is reputably known throughout the world as the "Queen of
Crime" and Samuel Johnson who is known as 'arguably the most distinguished man
of letters in English history' are only some of the many meritorious English
authors.

_**Tip: **_You can talk about a/few writer(s) of your own country who is
successful and well-known even worldwide. They might be contemporary writers
or might be from past centuries.

**Q. Have you ever thought about writing a book?  
Answer:** To be honest I haven't. My writing skills aren't so good so if I had
decided to do something like that it would have been a moderate work. In fact
I wouldn't want that because I am a perfectionist. In addition, my imagination
isn't that vivid to create a story myself so I would jump to the conclusion
that I am not the proper person for this activity. Besides, my favourite types
of books are biographies so this is the only plot that I could have written.
However, I prefer sharing my personal stories and experiences with my family
and friends in verbal from than written form.

_**Tip: **_You can also give a semi-negative answer by saying that you haven't
written a book but you would like to and give examples and your idea about the
story. You can also say that you have thought about writing a book and refer
to its content. Finally you can say that you have written a book if so give
details when you wrote it, what was the story and how you were inspired to
write this book.

**Q. How reading books is different from watching movies?  
Answer:** It is quite different indeed! While reading a book you can imagine
the characters and the scenes you are reading about and adjust them to your
desires.  Everyone makes an image about the main characters' outer appearance,
inner traits and so on and personally when I read a book I have a specific
actor or actress in my mind. So, I would say that books give someone the
chance to make stories based on their personality.

Movies on the other hand, have some standards. There is the visual element
which is absent in books and it can be either good or bad because in some
cases watching a movie is much better than reading a book but the opposite can
happen as well. Personally, I have seen movies having read the books before
and some of them weren't as good as I expected.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  **Describe a foreign country you have never been to.**

**You should say: **

  * where the country is
  * when you will go there
  * why you would like to go there

**and explain why this is a good country to visit.**  
  
**Follow-up Questions:**  
• Say something about the tourism development in your country, facility,
services  and the effect on environment.  
• What is the importance of travel and tourism industry?  
• What do you think the function of tourist guides?

**Possible Answer:**  
The country that I have always wanted to go but have not visited yet is Italy.
I've been dreaming to visit Italy for more than 2-3 years. I'll definitely
visit the country as soon as my graduation is complete. Italy is in Southern
Europe. Rome, the largest city and the Capital of Italy has been the leading
political and religious centre of the western civilization, serving as the
capital of the both Roman Empire and the Christianity. I'd like to go there to
see the museums, arts, streets, cultural and other attractions. Another reason
I want to go there is to visit the Vatican City. I have read and heard about
numerous stories and history about this country and witnessing them would be a
great joy for me. There are plenty of things to see: arts, museums, Colosseum,
Leaning Tower of Pissa, Roman Forum, Florence Cathedral, St. Peter's Basilica,
Milan Cathedral, Sistine Chapel, Piazza SanMarco, Circus Maximux and lots of
other places I'd love to visit.

Italy was one of the most advanced territories once and had lots of
historically significant places to visit. I've read about those places so many
times and heard stories from many of my friends that visiting this country has
become a major wish for me. And I'm pretty positive about visiting this
country in next year.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

Think of a country you know about. Now say that this is the country you have
never been to. In reality you may have visited Vietnam, India, and Australia
but have never been to Russia. But if you know very little about Russia, and
say that you have never been to Russia, you would be in a difficult position
to tell about this country. Rather you should pick a county you know about and
the examiner is not going to check your passport if you have really been there
or not!

State the face that you have read about this country, heard about this country
and seen in TV about this country but have never been to. You _**MUST NOT**_
pick your own country as an answer for this cue card.

Being able to state the following facts about the country you have never been
to would help you answering this cue card topic:

  * The capital of the country.
  * The location of the country.
  * The religion, culture and population of the country.
  * Where have you heard or learned about this country.
  * If you have any plan to visit this country in the future. If so why would you like to go there.
  * What tourist attractions does this country have.
  * The cultural distinction of this country.
  * Some major festivals of this country.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. Say something about the tourism development in your country, facility, services and the effect on environment.**  
**Answer:** In my country tourism industry plays a fundamental role not only in the summer, peak hour for tourism, but also in other seasons. I was born and raised in Greece so I would say that tourism constitutes an indispensable part of my country's economy. To begin, because of the renowned Greek islands, thousands of foreign visitors come here on vacation every summer and this results in reaping benefits in all levels. More precisely, many facilities such as airports, hospitals, hotels and restaurants have been constructed and they aren't beneficial only to visitors but also to locals. Many seasonal stores operate this period and in this way more people get employed and acquire an income, the whole economy is developed and consequently the country prospers.  
  
Apart from this beneficial part though, there are some detrimental
repercussions on the environment, due to the tremendous number of guests. Most
people, dispose their rubbish wherever they want and because of this roads and
pavements become really unsightly, smelly and unhygienic and this equals to
damage of a place's landscape. In addition, during the constant usage of means
of transport and especially planes, the CO2 emissions can cause air pollution
which is harmful to environment and public health, as it can cause respiratory
diseases.  
  
_**Tip: **_If your country is a tourist destination you can mention the things
that are written above, or anything else you desire. If this isn't the case,
you can just say that your place isn't preferred by visitors and justify your
answer in order to give a complete answer.

**Q. What is the importance of travel and tourism industry?**  
**Answer:** It is widely accepted that tourism is an essential sector of a country’s economy and in this way numerous benefits can be gained. The most important contribution of travel and tourism could be argued that is in economic sector. As mentioned previously, tourism provides employment and earning sources to many people. It also brings many facilities as well, not only to visitors but also to local inhabitants. By the construction of hotels, travel agencies, airlines, restaurants and other leisure industries which are used by the visitors a great amount of money is earned, and thus a country's GDP increases. 

Moreover, except from the direct results, there are some other indirect
benefits that play a really important role to a nation's economic development.
Given the fact that people can meet each other in person, international
business relationships and profits like competitive advantage, economies of
scale, higher exports and innovation could be derived. Lastly, investment can
be encouraged as trade and investment are interdependent.

**Q. What do you think the function of tourist guides?**  
**Answer:** A tour guide is a person who guides the visitors to explore different tourist attractions, explain the historic aspects of a place or a thing in the language of their choice. Guides help travelers to understand the culture of the region and the way of life its inhabitants and therefore, it is imperative that they are knowledgeable about the cities and countries where they work. Hence, they provide information on a country's culture, history, customs and heritage and they try to do their best in order for the foreign visitors to understand what they see in depth. Although it's relatively easy to become a tour guide in many parts of the world, in South Europe it's more difficult due to strict laws and it is regarded to be a unique profession with a great prestige.

sample-18-describe-a-teacher&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a teacher who has influenced you in your education.

**You should say:**  
• Where you met him/ her.  
• What subject s/he taught.  
• What was special about him /her

**and explain why this person influenced you so much.**

**Follow-up Questions:**  
• How has education changed in your country in the last 10 years?  
• What changes do you foresee in the next 50 years?  
• How do the expectations of today’s school leavers compare with those of the
previous generation?  
• What role do you think extracurricular activities play in education?

**Possible Answer: **  
I consider myself lucky to get several very good teachers throughout my
academic years. Among them I'd like to talk about Mr. Smith who was an
extraordinary teacher, a really good mentor and who has a great influence in
my education.

I met Mr. Smith when I was in class 4 and he was our math teacher. Initially
we thought that he would be a moody teacher and we would have to be very
polite in front of him. This impression came mostly because of his serious
face and tidy dress-up. But soon we found that, he is a very friendly person
and teaches us very well. He never made things complicated and tried over and
over again to explain something to us. He had a very unique way of teaching.
Seems like he would start an interesting story and later we would find that he
would relate the math with the story. Thus everything we learned from him was
interesting and that's why we remember most of the theory and techniques of
math he taught us.

I'd say he has a great influence in my education because he made a very strong
foundation on Mathematics. Later on I studied Science and the Mathematics was
the most important subject. I have always been good at math and that' mainly
because of Mr. Smith who had a major role on making the subject interesting to
me. Before I learned math from Mr. Smith, my impression on math was not good
and I considered mathematics to be a very difficult and uninteresting subject.
But his teaching and influences changed my way of thinking about math and
later on math became my one the most favourite subject.

###  Tips for answering this cue card question:

Talk about a teacher you remember and liked. Say his/her name and which class/
grade s/he taught. Also mention which subject she taught and what have you
learned from him/ her. Following are some of the reasons a teacher becomes
influential for a student that you can talk about:

  * The way of teaching is very effective and interesting.
  * S/he has a great personality and leads an exemplary life.
  * S/he tells lots of example and stories to make the subject and topic interesting.
  * S/he is a famous teacher on your locality who also taught your elder brother, father etc.
  * S/he has a great personality and because of that students like his/ her very much.
  * S/he has is successful explaining difficult topics in an easy and intuitive way.
  * S/he behaves very politely with all and never discriminates among students.
  * S/he is brave and speaks the right thing no matter what.    
  * S/he teaches lots of moral values as well as inspires students to study properly.
  * Apart from teaching s/he does some social works, creative stuffs and or anything which is beneficial for others.
  * S/he is a great orator and has a great personality.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. How has education changed in your country in the last 10 years?**  
**Answer:** The truth is that ten years ago the educational system wasn't the same as it is now and many aspects have changes in our education system. In the past years, teachers used conventional methods to transfer information and knowledge to their students and the only means they utilized was blackboards.  
  
Furthermore, as far as I'm concerned, schoolmasters paid more attention to
their student's weaknesses, problems and needs and the bonds between them were
stronger than nowadays. Moving to the present, the existing ties between
teachers and children have become more impersonal and unfortunately many
teachers willingly keep a distance from students in the classroom. In
addition, technological advances play a vital role in teaching and the methods
used before are now obsolete.  
  
To conclude, in my opinion, I prefer the educational system as it was 10 years
ago than it is now, because this isn't only the internet that makes someone
literate, but teachers and strong bonding between a teacher and a student do.

**Q. What changes do you foresee in the next 50 years?**  
**Answer:** It seems to me that in the forthcoming future the changes will be tremendous. First of all, it won't be necessary for teachers to be present in the classroom as everything is going to be accomplished by the usage of technology. For example, students will become knowledgeable about different matters from the comfort of their home and they will correspond with their tutors rather than having personal relationships. Of course, it still happens these days to a certain extent, but in the next 50 years I believe that this will be the way of teaching exclusively. Going further, I think that apart from some basic and necessary subjects such as literature and mathematics, all of the other will be optional and each child will have the opportunity to choose the subject they want to be taught even when at primary school. From my point of view, I cannot say for sure if this is the appropriate course of action, but one thing is clear; if this happens the disadvantages will be inevitable. 

**Q. How do the expectations of today’s school leavers compare with those of the previous generation?**  
**Answer:** When someone completed school in the past, they just hoped to find a job in order to earn a salary and cover their living expenses. Many, in the past, did not even look for jobs and continued their family business. They didn't have as high expectations as present school leavers have these days. 

In many cases, nowadays school-leavers don't have realistic expectations and
they expect a high position with high income, even without professional
experience. Furthermore, these days knowledge isn't the only element required
for a good job as skills, experience, passion about work, learning, discipline
and adaptability to name but a few, are prerequisite in order for someone to
enter the labour market. That, however was not the case in the past.

**Q. What role do you think extracurricular activities play in education?**  
**Answer:** It is commonly believed that extracurricular activities play an important role in education and have many benefits both in personal and professional life. I quite agree with that as those activities enhance someone’s capability and improve the way of thinking. First of all, children with extracurricular activities learn how to collaborate and co-exists with other peers and learn about soft skills and values. In addition, a great opportunity is provided to them to interrelate with others and develop and evolve their interpersonal skills. Hence, these types of activities can create a feeling of contribution, as children are involved in different things and this will lead them to boost their self-esteem. Lastly, all these advantages will help children to build a well-rounded personality and an exceptional character and will benefit school and teachers by having well-mannered and conscious students.

browse](/images/IELTS_cue_card/IELTS_Cue_Card_Describe_a_website_you_often_browse.jpg)



**Model Answer 1:**  
I have just a few minutes to tell you about a website I often browse.  I will
tell you what the website is, how long I’ve been using it, a bit about what is
on it and why I visit it so often.

The website is the BBC news website.  You can find it at
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news but I just have it as a favourite on my toolbar. I
am a complete BBC junkie!  I visit the website several times a day if I can,
and have been using it for as long as I can remember.  Possibly for as long as
the website has been in existence but definitely for the past ten years or
more.

The BBC news website is massive.  It contains rolling headlines of breaking
news, and from the landing page you can jump to sections on different types of
news categories.  For example there are tabs for world news; health issues;
environmental reports; education; sport; education and science as well as
entertainment and arts stories.  You can read just text based articles
illustrated with a few pictures – which is my preferred way of accessing news
and information – or you can opt to see news film or audio clips.  I think the
website is really comprehensive and easy to use too.

The BBC news website for me, is a one-stop location for all current affairs
and news items.  I really like that I can see headlines of breaking news
almost instantaneously, but it also includes more thoughtful reporting.
Detailed online articles with considered analysis about global or local
events.  I can also find out what the weather forecast is – always handy in
the UK where it can change so quickly, plus I like to be able to keep an eye
on what is happening locally to me in Sheffield where I live.  I also trust
the BBC website to give balanced reporting, I think it has journalistic
integrity, so I feel if I read it every day, I will have a good perspective on
what is going on in the world, and enough information to come to my own
conclusions on current affairs across the globe.The only downside of the
website is that I find it can be a bit addictive!  Because it is updated
frequently it is tempting to keep going back and having another look if there
is some running news item that I am following.  It can lead me to
procrastinate when I am supposed to be working, but I tell myself it is
important to keep up to date with what is going on in the world, even though I
know that really, it wouldn’t hurt to limit myself to a news ‘fix’ just a
couple of times a day!

I wonder if you use the website too, and if you do, whether you might as avid
a follower as me!

**Possible Answer 2:**  
I've been using the internet for more than 10 years and from the very
beginning till now there are some websites those I use almost every day.
www.yahoo.com is one of those web-sites and possibly I'll use this site
forever. www.yahoo.com is basically an e-mail service provider and a very
popular search engine. I can still remember my first day at a cyber-cafe where
I opened the first web site of my life and that was yahoo.com and the cafe
owner helped me to open an e-mail address and I still use this email address
to send and receive e-mails and for chatting. www.yahoo.com is a popular
search engine possibly next to www.google.com but as an e-mail service
provider it is more popular than www.google.com in my country .This web-site
has many other useful features like: the homepage contains up-to-date news and
feeds. It also gives the option to open free websites to its users etc.
www.my.yahoo.com is a very popular service and recently the
www.answers.yahoo.com has become one of the most popular questions and answers
web-site that's millions of people are using.

**Alternative Answer 3:**  
I use internet daily and there are lots of websites that I often browse for
different reasons. But probably www.facebook.com is the one I most often
browse. It is a social networking website and probably is one of the top 5
most visited websites in the world. The website mainly facilitates me stay
connected with my friends and helps me update and broadcast my news as well.
Though the primary purpose of this website is to let people communicate
friends and known people but there are lots of other features as well. It
offers games, eCommerce facility, emailing, chatting, making new friends,
social marketing, different campaign, fan page opening etc. I have been using
the website from 2004 and it is important to me because all of my friends and
relatives are connected there. If a friend has a birthday, the website
notifies me and I can wish him/ her a birthday, if someone has a new photo or
news to share, I can see it from my account. I can share my photo, video,
updates, thought as well. If someone opines on an issue, others can comment on
it. For me, the website is important because my childhood friends, adolescence
friends, college &amp; University friends are connected there. I get their
updates regularly and can let them know what's happening over here. In no
other way I could have been connected to the people I am now connected via
facebook. I use this website from my computer and from my cell phone as well.
For me this is a social networking website where I remain close to my friends
and relatives. But with its own right it has become a powerful eCommerce
platform, gaming place, marketing channel, and many more other business
related platform.

Nowadays everybody owns a facebook ID. Making new friends is easy in facebook
and that helps people grow their friends beyond boundary. Millions of people
use facebook and it is almost impossible to connect with people you care and
know without this website.

###  **Tips for answering this Cue Card question:**

Pick a website which is popular and you often visit. If you prefer to talk
about a website which is not known to all, mention that this is not a very
popular website but I visit it for this particular reason. You can pick a
social networking website, email service providing website, news channel
website, your university or office website, a website you have developed and
visit for updating it, Wikipedia like website etc. If you pick a website which
is popular, do not give any fictitious information. Giving false information
about a well-known website like Google, Yahoo or Facebook would create some
doubts in the examiner's mind as s/he might also be a user of this website.

Do not worry if you do not know every details of the website even if the
question asks you to describe about it. If you do not know the owner name,
operation since, technical aspects of the website, simply skip those parts
instead of giving imaginary information. You can focus on what the website
offers to the visitors and what you do from this website. For instance:

**Social Networking websites: **  
Most of my friends are also connected in this website/ social network and I
get their updates.  
I can publish my updates and let my friends know about it.  
It helps me finding my old friends/ family members.  
It offers me to use third party applications and play games.  
I can share my images and videos.  
Help me find out information related to my education/ job.  
Chat with my friends.

**Email Service providers: **  
I send emails from this website.  
I check the emails sent to me.  
I can send attachments.  
Has a good spam filtering and threat detection service.

**Wikipedia like website: **  
Helps me finding reliable and details information on various topics.  
Loads faster and has subscription option.  
I can contribute on updating the information.  
Most of the topics are covered and you can get almost all of the information
you need.

**News websites: **  
Provides updated and latest news.  
Both local and international news are served.  
Has email notification service on my selective topics.  
Gives sports news and events.  
Offers interesting supplementary and magazines as well.  
News presentation is outstanding and sources are very reliable.  
Covers last minute news as well.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q: How long have you been using the Internet?**  
**Answer:** I have been using the Internet since I bought my first personal computer in 2007. At first, I didn't know how to use it properly but as time went by I became aware of it. I use it constantly every day either for studies and work or for entertainment. I check my e-mails, read the news, watch movies and TV series, listen to music. It's instantly accessible and I can find massive amount of information on various topics such as health issues, environmental, economy, sports, education et cetera. I have become really dependent on that and I consume almost all of my spare time surfing the internet. 

**Q: How Internet has changed our life-style?**  
**Answer:** This is a really controversial issue. On the one hand, Internet has made our lives better and simpler as everyone nowadays seems to be moving online. It provides reliable and accurate information on many topics. It is user-friendly because you can find anything you need by just sitting on a chair rather than going to a library and of course it has made communication much easier and faster as it connects people across the globe. Furthermore, it results in developing our cognitive skills because we can gain or even expand our existing knowledge and this knowledge can be shared instantly. On the other hand, Internet has led to a kind of addiction and it declines the ability of interacting and socializing. This leads to isolation and feelings of loneliness because we deprive of social interaction. Last but not least, Internet can be risky in some cases, especially for kids, and for online transactions. Hacking, identity theft, and online crimes are some common drawbacks of Internet. 

_**Tip:**_  
**Positive sides** of the Internet- it fosters communication around the world, helps people make more friends, creates opportunities for business and e-commerce, online shopping at better prices, fosters tolerance and understanding, creates positive changes in attitudes, brings information at our finger tap, makes business transaction easier and help learn things better.     
  
**Negative sides:** Widespread use leads to isolation because people have online friends only and they lose their friends they see in the flesh, identity theft, hacking, spread of malware &amp; virus, dependency on internet kills our social skill, chances of plagiarism etc. 

**Q: What would be the possible uses of Internet in the future?**  
**Answer:** My personal opinion is that driving is an activity that will be controlled entirely by the Internet in the future. Furthermore, it will be able to trace any kind of shortages of necessary goods in our houses, for example if we run out of sugar, coffee, fruits and vegetables etc. Internet will place online orders for those items automatically. It will have predominant role in medicine as well by making all kinds of surgeries and check-ups and doctors will only have to press a button. Another use that comes to my head is in universities. In the next twenty years or so lectures will only be online and every student will have to attend university from their own personal computer. Moreover people will primarily communicate using Internet and land lines and cell phone networks would no longer be required. Finally, more interactive software and websites would be available that would connect the world data and would serve to the users.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a friend from your childhood.

**You should say:**

  * how you met him/her
  * how long you are friends &amp; what you did together
  * What made you like him/ her

**and explain your friendship.**

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Rounding off questions:**

  * Why childhood is important for us?
  * What changes have you gone through from your childhood?
  * What are the differences between childhood friends and college friends?

**Sample Answer 1: **  
I am going to tell you about my first ‘best friend’ from childhood.  I’ll
explain how we met, how long we were friends, what we got up to and why I
liked her so much, and I’ll try and explain our friendship so you can
understand why we were so close.

I first met my friend Tracey when I went to junior school.  We were sat next
to each other in class, I don’t think we chose to do that particularly, we
probably just sat where we were told to on our first day of the school year,
but we got on straight away and were firm friends from the age of about 8
until we left school to go to senior school aged about eleven.  We happened to
go to different schools at that point, and sadly our friendship drifted apart,
when we were younger though, we were inseparable.

Tracey and I had similar interests.  We liked being outside, we liked horses
(although neither of us went riding or had access to ponies back then), we
enjoyed doing craft type activities (although she was really talented creating
amazing pictures and art work, whilst I just got stuck at the stage of
colouring in!)  My main memory is of us heading off together on our bikes for
hours and hours at a time.  She lived quite near a large park, so I used to
cycle to her house, and then we’d go to the park together with a picnic lunch
and spend all day playing games together.  I’m embarrassed now to think how we
galloped around pretending to be horses or whatever the game of the day was,
but it was fun at the time.  We used to try hula hooping and skipping too,
seeing who could hold up a hoop for the longest of skip without stopping using
a rope.  I have a feeling she was more accomplished than me at both these
activities too.  Sometimes we would try to find and catch grasshoppers (we
always let them go) or we would just laze in the sun until it was time to go
home.  It was very different then. There were no mobile phones, and people
were much more relaxed about letting their children go off and play all day,
I’m not sure if you could still do that. Still, we were very happy, and used
to come back to her house tired and hot and sun burnt, and if we were lucky
her mum would give us lemonade to drink and sometimes cheese salad rolls for
tea.  Happy memories indeed!

In terms of why we liked each other, well we just did!  We enjoyed doing the
same things, we could talk about anything to each other – complaining about
school work or annoying parents and other such troublesome worries of the
time.  She had pet rabbits, and I had pet guinea pigs, so looking after our
pets was a shared interest too.  It probably helped that we lived quite close
to each other and both had bikes too.  We also both had a vivid imagination,
it meant we could have remarkable adventures together pretending to inhabit
whole new worlds that we had invented for ourselves.

We kept in touch for a while, but both eventually moved on.  I think she went
on to become an artist of some renown, which was not surprising given her
early talent for art.  Whatever she does and wherever she ended up I hope she
is happy and successful too, and I will always remember her as a brilliant
companion from when I was young, I wonder if she remembers me too.

**Model Answer 2: **  
Childhood has its specialty and magic and sometimes childhood friends are
unforgettable. One such friend I recall was Masud who I still remember. Our
friendship lasted only for a year and after that he moved to a different city
with his parents. I met him at our first day in school. I was late for school
due to a bad traffic and when I reached my classroom, I thought that all of
the seats have been occupied and I was desperately looking for a place to sit.
The class teacher asked my name and announced to make a seat for me. I found
that one of the boys was asking me to go over there and sit beside him. This
very boy was Masud and I was grateful to him.  
  
In the Tiffin time I shared my foods with him and talked about lots of things.
From that next day we started sitting next to each other and our friendship
began to flourish. I found that he collects stamps as a hobby and I was
excited to find this common hobby between us. We were very close friends and
after one year I heard that he would be moving to a new city as his father has
been transferred there. I did not know his postal address and as a consequence
I could not communicate him. We did not meet each other after that but he was
such a good and close friend that I still miss him sometimes.  
  
We did a lot of interesting and fun stuffs together. At school we played
footballs and other games in the interval period. We made kites and flew them
together, we went to many places to buy stamps, we went to library to read
book, we went to river to swim, we climbed in trees, we played crickets, we
walked in the streets and told stories to each other and did many other things
together.  
  
He was a lively and helpful boy who liked me very much. We had many things in
common and we helped each other on our studies. Since I enjoyed doing stuffs
with him, I liked him as a friend as well. We had a strong bonding and
intimate friendship between us. We tried to help each other whenever needed.

###  Tips for answering this cue card question:

This topic is very similar to the cue card "[Describe a friend who you really
like to spend time with](/cue-card-sample/500-ielts-cue-card-
sample-19-describe-a-friend "IELTS Cue Card Sample 19 - Describe a friend" )",
except that you should talk about a friend from your childhood. There is a
good possibility that you no longer meet him/her very often but as a childhood
friend, you keep in touch.

**Following are some points you can mention to answer this cue card topic:**  
  
1\. You had lots of fun stuffs together in childhood and you enjoyed his/ her
company.  
2\. You went school together, you played together and you spend lots of time
together.  
3\. You meet him/her whenever you visit your hometown and you still enjoy his
friendship.  
4\. You two have strong bonding as your friendship go matured over time.  
5\. You two had lots of common interest and you learned many things from
him/her.  
6\. Describe what you did together in the childhood, how you spent time then
and how you two started living in two different places.  
7\. Not necessarily you two have two live in two different places; you can
mention that you two are still close and meet very friendly.  
8\. Say 1-2 interesting memories you two had together.  
9\. Talk about some reasons you liked him.

**Rounding off questions/ Follow-up Questions:**

**Q. Why childhood is important for us?  
Answer:** It is an indisputable fact that childhood is the best period in our
life. Children are carefree, play all the time and have no concerns. In
addition, childish memories are really important and many times determine
children's life and personality. It's true that there are many cases when
people with an extremely unpleasant childhood tend to be mentally disturbed
not only when they reach adulthood but also later in their life. So I would
jump to the conclusion that it's imperative that a child is raised in a
caring, loving and supportive environment in order to maximize their future
well-being and become emotionally- secure adults.

**Q. What changes have you gone through from your childhood?**  
**Answer:** It's obvious that all of us have undergone changes through the transition from childhood to adulthood. First of all, external appearance has completely changed, as my body has developed and I have grown taller. In addition, I would say that I am able to maintain my composure when difficulties come up and I am more mature than the time when I was little. Furthermore, I am tolerant to diversity and I have learnt to respect other people's preferences, opinions and attitudes. Lastly, my educational level isn't the same as it was in my early years, as I have graduated from university and specialized in a particular field. 

**Q. What are the differences between childhood friends and college friends?**  
**Answer:** That's a really interesting and substantial question. Friends during childhood are just some children who we spent time with and share some common interests. They are more like our playmates that soulmates. On the contrary, college friends are some important people with whom we share a really strong bonding and become close to. Furthermore, most of the time friends from higher educational institutions are like siblings and long-time relationships are built, as they are based on true feeling such as trust, compassion, love and so on. For example, my best friend from university is like a brother to me and also my best man and in this way we have sealed our relationship while I do not have any childhood friends whom I still communicate. 

###  Part 3 – Detail discussion / Two-way discussion:

**_Friendship:_**

**Q. What do you think makes someone a good friend to a whole family?  
Answer:**  It seems to me that the main element in order for someone to be
considered a friend to all members of a family is having common values and
interests. If these two characteristics are absent or not compatible, it's
really difficult for someone to be accepted as a family friend or to hang out
with.

Moreover, if parents see that someone has a good personality and some basic
virtues that support the notion of friendship, it is likely that they will
like and accept this person to their family.  In my opinion, family friends
play an important role as there are many cases when parents consort with some
people they consider friends, and many times it is likely that their kids also
interact with those people.

**Q. Do you think we meet different kinds of friends at different stages of our lives? In what ways are these types of friend different?  
Answer:**  I totally agree with that statement as I believe we have different
expectations and requirements for our friends in different stages of our life.
When children are in primary schools, they just have one or two friends and
this is because at that stage they are not capable of assessing and appreciate
the importance of friendship. In the early stages in our life we require
friends who would love to play with us, do things that we like to do. So,
these relationships are slack and nothing is invested as far as feelings are
concerned. However, we start understanding the significance of this bond in
high school as make some friends who have similar interests and can help us in
study. Friends during puberty on the other hand, are in many cases the most
important in someone's life and often these relationships are really strong
and based on solid foundation. At that period of life, people's' relationships
are true and substantial as real feelings such as love, affection, support and
trust are dominant. When we start our career, we will have many friends who
are basically colleagues. In the old age people usually have friends who are
more like family members.  
  
So, I would say that friends in the very early ages are just some playmates
who kids hang out and spend some time with and the teen to adult stages
include very important and worthy people that are much more than friends.

**Q. How easy is it to make friends with people from a different age group?  
Answer:** It's a controversial issue as some would say it is quite easy to
make friends from different age groups while others would deny it.

In my opinion, the most important characteristics in making friends are
communication and common views. In this way people are able to talk about
different things, make meaningful conversations and swap ideas. If these
elements don't exist, even among the people of same age group, then it's
really difficult for someone to make friends. I would say that usually people
find it easier to have friends of same age groups, but if effective
communication and common views work smoothly between two persons of different
age groups, they can become good friends. For example, a friend of mine who is
around my age has a close friend of 60. When I found about that I was
surprised, but when I saw that they have so much in common and they have great
times together, I totally endorsed it. As far as I'm concerned, I don't have
friends who are much older than I am but I have younger friends and common
interests make us a really tight group.

**_Influence of friends:_**

**Q. Do you think it is possible to be friends with someone if you never meet them in person?**  
**Answer:** It’s an interesting question to answer and I would say that it is possible indeed, but it's not the same as having friends who we meet personally and interact face-to-face. Nowadays, especially due to technological advances, more and more people chat and interact with each other via chatting, calling and social media applications and in this way they develop different kinds of relationships. There are many cases when someone talks with another person on a constant basis and share personal things, experiences and they turn out to call each other 'friend'. But in my opinion, I would say that this person  is more of an e-buddy rather than a real friend. A friend is someone that people can see in the flesh and consort with them regularly. 

**Q. Is this real friendship?**  
**Answer:** As I extensively mentioned earlier, this isn't true friendship, at least in my taste. Many positive sentiments may be created, such as rapport, confidence and happiness, but friendship is much more than only a word and it entails that people have a contact on a regular basis and hang out with each other. E-friendship, is a different type of friendship, I would say an impersonal one, because friends aren't able to meet each other in person and the only thing they can do is talk by typing keystrokes on the keyboard or make video calls. Such friendship is growing faster due to our reliance on technology, but they are not real friendship, in my opinion.  

**Q. What kind of influence can friends have on our lives?**  
**Answer:** It is argued that friends are the second most influential persons in someone's life, after the parents. A famous saying ‘A person is known by the company he keeps’ is indeed a reflection that we are greatly influenced by the friends we have. Especially at adolescence, children are impressionable as they form their personality and character and oftentimes they copy their peers. During this time good friends can instill positive attributes and elements in a person while the opposite is also true.  
  
Friends constitute a big part of our life and they play a very important role.
They can contribute to the creation of positive feelings for us such as
happiness, self-confidence, esteem and control and can also delude us to have
negative feelings and activities. Hence, they can be determinants of someone's
character as friendship can play a vital role in a person's beliefs.

**Q. How important would you say it is to have friends from different cultures?**  
**Answer:** In my opinion, having friends from diverse cultures is extremely important and helpful. Initially, people learn many things about other cultures such as history, customs, values and points, and this way their knowledge in enhanced. Furthermore, it promotes diversity and cultivates tolerance and understanding as well as positive changes in our attitude. For example, by having a friend with completely different culture, people can swap opinions, broaden their horizons and become tolerant about things they have not faced before. To conclude, I reckon that it is essential that people have pals from different countries because as far as I'm concerned, this could only lead to positive outcomes.

This is an easy topic for me as I know exactly who I want to tell you about!
I’ll say who she is, how long I have known her, a bit about her special
qualities and why I admire her so much.

I don’t think of this person as old, but I suppose she is because she will be
90 next year, and that’s certainly a good age.  She is a distant cousin of
mine, she now lives in a residential nursing home, which makes me sad, but she
has had a full and interesting life and done many amazing, brave and brilliant
things.

I think I have known her about twenty one years, but the story of how we came
to be friends is a little strange.  I was about to go travelling to Australia,
and was staying with my parents in London overnight before catching a plane
from Heathrow the following day.  Whilst I was there my parents told me about
this distant cousin who had been in a road accident and was in hospital.  She
was/is a very well educated woman with many academic and cultural interests,
and they were wondering what to take her to read during her stay.  I offered
some of my collection of short story books.  I wasn’t sure they would be to
her taste, they dealt with political issues and were not by any means what I
would have expected an elderly sick relative to be interested in.  The volumes
were by Alice Walker, Susan Hill and other such writers.

My cousin loved them!  She wrote to me whilst I was in Australia to tell me,
and also mentioned that she herself had worked in Australia for many years.
She had a very illustrious career as a paediatric pathologist, but also did
research on things like mammalian hearts which took her all over the world.
She asked me to look up an old friend of hers whilst I was there, which I did
with some reluctance as I wasn’t sure what I’d find.  I met another amazing
woman who lived in the middle of beautiful rainforest and was passionate about
conservation.  When I came back to England a year later, I visited my cousin
to tell her all about my travels, and that was the beginning of an ongoing
friendship. We have always corresponded with one another and I find her wise
and a great role model.  We have shared interests and I think our
personalities are also rather alike – for better or worse!  Opinionated and
stubborn at times, but also caring very much about the world and those around
us and constantly curious and restless.  Endlessly wanting to go and explore
and experience new things.  We share a wanderlust at least!

My cousin is intelligent, well-travelled and very independent.  She has
insight and great skill in academic writing.  Over the years I’ve shared with
her my own writing efforts, looked to her for advice on what to do when facing
certain decisions, and gained inspiration from her lifestyle.  She is very
good at setting herself goals and getting on with things – it would be fair to
say she doesn’t suffer fools gladly, so she is certainly someone who will put
you straight on things.  I think of her as a ‘critical friend’ I know she
cares about me a lot, as I do her, but that doesn’t mean she’ll indulge me at
all if she feels I’m being foolish in any way.  She never married, and I too
am on my own, so I think we sort of understand one another, and we both like
our own space, which can be confusing for some people at times.

I admire her hugely, her health is frail now, and that makes me sad, but she
has achieved so much in her career, life and network of friends.  If I can do
half as well in the time I have I’ll be very content with that!

**Possible Answer 2:**  
The aged person whom I really admire and like is my grandmother. From my
childhood she has always been a caring person and loved me very much. Till now
she is a good friend of mine with whom I share so many of my personal
information. She is a benevolent and good person who possesses a good heart.
She tries to help others with her highest efforts. I know her from my
childhood as she has been living with us for a long and we have lots of happy
memories together.

She is a successful mother of 4, including my father. She has devoted her
entire life for her kids and made them educated and helped them greatly to be
established. She possesses a nice and charming personality that always pleases
people around her. She is a kind and a wise woman.

I love and admire her for many different reasons. The most important reason is
because of her unconditional love and affection for me. She is a good mentor
who can shows me positive ways and guide me in my distressing time. Talking to
her is a soothing experience and the stories she tells are always attractive
and full of morality. I have learned many positive attitudes and good thinking
from her. For all those reasons and a strong bonding between us, I admire her
very much.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe someone you know who is a good cook.

**You should say:**

  *  Who this person is
  *  How you know him or her
  * What kinds of food s/he cooks

**and explain why this person is good at cooking.**

**Follow-up Questions: **

  * What are the prospects of building a career as a cook in your country? 
  * What special dishes you want to taste? Why?
  * What traditional foods you would like your foreigner friends try?

**Model Answer 1: **  
Unfortunately, I am a terrible cook, but that does mean I can appreciate those
who can! I’m going to tell you about a friend of mine who is a wonderful chef,
how I know her, what she can cook and why I think she is so great it.

This person is a friend of mine, I know her through a running club I belong
too, and as I’ve got to know her better over the years we now socialise
together, I also sometime help her with her allotment and I’ve been lucky
enough to eat at her house many times.  She runs her own business, making
bespoke biscuits, carefully decorated with original designs, so it’s just as
well she can cook.  But she also runs a busy house hold and regularly cooks
delicious wholesome meals for her family.

This friend can seemingly cook anything, anywhere!  She makes her own bread,
and can conjure a meal at a moment’s notice using eggs from her hens and herbs
from her garden.  She cooks really healthy food and, fortunately for me, seems
to enjoy catering for unexpected guests too.  She is makes a very find
chocolate and orange cake, and her biscuits are famous amongst her friends as
well as her clients.  However, for me a favourite meal was one she made for me
recently.  We went up to work on her allotment – that’s an area of land you
can rent for a small fee from the local council as long as you use it for
growing fruit and vegetables.  It was a lovely summer’s day, and we planned to
work into the evening preparing the ground.  She had planned ahead.  She
brought up a small gas burner, a saucepan and some chopped red peppers, onions
and other vegetables which she cooked up for us with some delicious friend
halloumi cheese.  She had even thought to bring fresh salad leaves, a light
dressing and a sort of wrap to hold it all together.  After our hard work on
the land we enjoyed the late evening sun and ate with relish.  Nothing tastes
as good as food eaten outside after physical work.

Why is she so good at cooking?  I think it’s partly because she enjoys it, she
has had a lot of practice, and it is her passion as well as her profession.  I
think she is good because she uses fresh and quality ingredients, quite simple
recipes often, but tasty nutritious and beautifully – though not over-fussily
– presented.  I also think a really great cook is calm, relaxed and enjoys the
sharing of their labours, she is all these things too. I feel very lucky to
know her, and feel a little guilty that I don’t ever cook in return!  It seems
it is my contribution to always be a particularly appreciative consumer… it is
a hard job, but someone has to do it!

**Model Answer 2:**  
I know some of my relatives who are good at cooking and I have heard about
some famous cooks, _nationally and internationally_, who have magical power of
making delicious cuisines. But I'd like to talk about my mother whom I think
is the greatest cook of the world. I have never enjoyed any menu more than the
foods made by my mother. She is a gifted cook and she has a good reputation of
making delicious and tasty menu out of very ordinary ingredients.  
  
The way she arranges the kitchen and makes foods is lovely and in my childhood
I used to think that she had taken training on cooking. But she actually
learned the cooking from her family and was in charge of cooking for a large
joint family. She is a graduate and I heard that she has a passion of cooking
as she took several subjects related to house-keeping and cooking.  
  
My mother was raised in a sub-urban area and got married at her 20 years of
old. She continued her education and then took charge of cooking in my
father's family. I have heard the appreciation of her cooking from many of our
relatives and neighbours and felt proud of her.  
  
Finding her cooking gives me a feeling that it's not a hard task, rather it's
an artistic performance that the performer enjoys a lot. Sometimes I have been
amazed to find her making foods in no times for the guests.  
  
She mostly makes foods for the family members and that includes cooking making
breads, rice, meats, fishes, burgers, sweet-meats, curry etc. For the
festivals she makes cake, rich foods, and snacks, local and foreign cuisines.
I have found her cooking Chinese, Thai, Italian and Mexican foods as well and
that was always a wonder how she has learned those menus as she has never
travelled to those countries nor has taken any training on making those foods.
It will always be a mystery to me.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card topic:

You can talk about one of your family members who you know is good at cooking.
Alternatively you can talk about a famous cook from your city and country.
This cue card asks you to talk about a person who is a good cook. So you can
describe a famous cook who is not personally known to you but you have heard
about him/her from newspaper, internet or TV. But specifically mention that
you have heard about his/her cooking skills and fames from a source and never
met him / her personally.  


You can also talk about your mother/ sisters or grandmother and describe her
cooking ability. Talking about a family member/ friend or relative would help
you describing them in details and you would be able to give more information
about them than a famous cook who you know very little.

Interestingly, males are also good at cooking so you can pick your father,
uncle or brother as well and describe their cooking skills. It would be
alluring to talk about yourself if you are a good cook. But avoid that!
Describing your cooking ability and skills as well as other qualities would be
bit tricky to talk about.

  
**Things you should mention about the person who you would like to describe as a good cook:**  


Can cook several dishes.

Has a natural talent of cooking foods.

People always appreciate the dishes s/he cooks.

S/he has learned cooking from his/her family and has no academic training on
cooking.

Or, S/he has taken a course on cooking and thus his/ her interests on cooking
grew up.



**You should be able to answer the following cue cards as well if you prepare for this cue card topic: **



**1\. Describe a person of your family who has a special skill. **

**2\. Describe something you learned from your family members. **

**3\. Describe skill you have. **

**4\. Describe a family member of your family. **

**5\. Talk about one of your friends who has a skill you admire. **

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  A speech that somebody delivered and you heard.

**You should say: **

  * Who gave the speech
  * What the topic of the speech was
  * Whether it impressed you or not

**and explain why did you like / dislike the speech.**

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * What are the difference between a political speech and a speech given by a non-political person?
  * What are the important aspects of a good speech?
  * What makes a person a good speech giver?

**Possible Answer 1: **  
I have heard numerous speeches, lectures, commentaries on various topics and
issues throughout different stages of my life and among them the speech that
was given by our primary school teacher on occasion of our fare-well is the
most influential one and I still vividly recall it. The teacher who gave the
speech was Mr. Mark Augustine and he was at his late forties at that time. As
fifth grade school going kids we did not comprehend quite clearly what was the
school fare-well all about. We knew that this is going to be our last day at
our primary school and we would start our new school soon. Mr. Mark was
already a revered teacher for his teaching style, good manor, humour and
honesty. Rumour had that, he was much more qualified to be a college professor
rather than being a primary school teacher.

On the day, we had our parents present in school and we had been enjoying
everything. As part of the farewell speech Mr. Mark approached to the stage
and started mentioning what funny things we had done in the last 5 years. We
as well as our parents started laughing on the things he mentioned. He
mentioned how a kid started screaming in the sight of a cockroach, how a kid
of class two expressed his friendship to a girl, how we tried to play amid of
the class and many more interesting and funny events.

He then moved on topics that I still hear in my mind. He told how study is our
primary responsibility, how we should listen to our parents, how have we
achieved our liberation as a nation, how to respect the Mother Nature and all
the honestly and bravery we should possess in our heart. The topics and his
way of presenting them vibrated us heavily. I can still remember how the
advises came back to my life time to time. As a kid those advises and
moralities were probably way to heavy to grasp but I still believe that the
speech had a great impact in my life as well as the lives of the other kids
who were present there.

**Sample Answer 2: **  
Speeches are funny things!  Some people are really good at public speaking,
and others just aren’t.  I think it is very difficult to talk in front of
other people in an engaging way but when people do this really well, then you
remember the occasion and how you felt at the time too.  Obviously really bad
speeches can be memorable too, but I’m not going to talk about any of those
today.

I want to tell you about a short speech I heard in a work context, I’ll tell
you who gave the speech, what it was about and why I think it was so good.

The speech was given by a manager in a place I was working.  He was giving a
speech to say goodbye to one of our colleagues who was leaving to set up as an
independent consultant, but who had worked at the organisation a very long
time, perhaps forty years.  Everyone was sad to see this person go, as they
were very popular, but we all wished them well and understood why they felt
they needed to move on.  It was a reasonably big workforce, so about sixty of
us had gathered in the open-plan office to say goodbye and present a gift to
our departing friend and co-worker.

I think sometimes ‘leaving-do’s’ can be really awkward and embarrassing
Everyone stands around self-consciously and there is an excruciating and brief
‘goodbye and thank you’ from the boss, and then everyone stares at the poor
person who is leaving whilst they rip open and read a rapidly bought card and
mumble their  thanks for a rather anonymous gift. This however was different.
Our manager had made a real effort to prepare a good speech that was funny,
well-researched, engaging and genuinely affectionate.  For example, one of the
things he did, was go back to our colleagues original application form and he
put together a quiz for all of us to do, in which we had to guess what hobbies
and qualifications they had declared all that time ago.  It was a great way to
‘break the ice’ and involve everyone, and the results were hilarious.  Even
the colleague who was leaving was amazed at the contents of his original form.
He also thanked the colleague for some very specific work that he had done,
and read out comments from others that he had been collecting over the last
couple of weeks which were mini testimonials and statements of appreciation
from other colleagues.

I think the speech was good because it involved everyone, shared funny (but
not too private) stories that were relevant to the leaver, and the effort our
boss had put into preparing it showed his respect and admiration for the
colleague who was departing.  The quiz also gave everyone something to talk
about, so people could chat and mingle a bit after the presentation. It was
also not too long!  It held interest, and was appropriate for the context.

For me, the speech was a really good example of how to communicate effectively
on such an occasion.  It was perfectly judged and helped bring the team
together even though someone was leaving, and made me – and others too – feel
happy and lucky that we worked in such a caring team.

visited&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

****IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.****

##  Describe a library that you visited.

**You should say:**

  * Where it was
  * What it looked like
  * What facilities it had

**And explain what influence it had on you and how you felt about it. **

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * Why library is important?
  * What facilities do you expect from a library?
  * What type of book do you like to read? Why do you like them?

**Possible Answer:**  
The library I’d like to talk about that I visited is ‘Illumination Library’
(Tell the name of a library from your home town)  and it is situated in my
home town. I have not visited this particular library for the last 2-3 years
as I am not living in my hometown any longer and yet this is the library I
will always remember. This library is situated at the centre of our home town
and occupies the whole 3 story building. There are plenty of books there and
the library offers variety of books, novels, research papers, magazines and
many more for people of different tastes.  
  
The books are well catalogued and arranged in a convenient fashion. There are
more than 3-4 librarians and several other assistants to help find any book.
The library also offers membership facility and the active members are allowed
to take books to home. Since the library is funded by government the
membership fee is very negligible and affordable for students, there are lots
of people visiting and reading there.  
  
People of our hometown consider this library as the best place to gather
knowledge, read in peace and to find reference books for study or professional
reasons.  
For me this library has a great influence on me. I became a member of this
library when I was only 7 years old. My reading habit has been grown up from
there. I became a passionate reader of books and novels and this library had a
great influence on that. This library also helped me finishing some academic
projects as I could find books and reference reading materials. I have read
plenty of books in my childhood and adolescence time only because the library
was conveniently there for me.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

You can talk about any library you have visited including your college/
university library. If the questions would have asked you to describe a famous
library, then it would have been bit tricky, but answering this cue card

photographs&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe one of your favourite photographs.

**You should say:**

  * When the photograph was taken
  * What it looks like
  * What significant memory you have regarding this photograph

**and explain why it is one of your favourite photographs.**

**Follow-up Questions: **

  * What do you think about 'Photography' as a career?
  * What makes a good photograph?
  * What are the improvements latest technologies has bought in photography?
  * How often do you take photographs?

**Possible Answer:**  
The photograph that was taken when I was only 4-5 years old with my parents,
grandfather and grandmother is one of my very favourite photographs. I do not
have clear memory regarding the event when the photograph was taken but I have
seen it thousands times and still I look at it with a delight and sadness. The
photograph is a black-and-white one and later I have enlarged it and framed it
in my living room. The small kid (me), the grandparents and young parents make
the picture a really significant one to me. I look with amazement in to the
picture and sometimes can't believe I was so small and different looking at
that time The picture gives me a gloomy feelings as my grandfather and mother
are no longer with us. In the picture they look so lively but I can't be with
them anymore!  
  
I was wearing a full sleeve shirt, full pant and a pair of red shoes. In the
picture I was in the middle and was sitting in a chair. Others were standing
around me - my parents are on the right and my grandparents are on the left.
My father was very stylish and was wearing fashionable dress in the picture.
My grandfather had spectacles in his eyes and had his hair back-brushed. My
mother and grandmother were wearing traditional dresses but both looked so
fresh and happy in the picture.  
  
This photograph is probably is my most favourite one ass it conveys my
grandparents' memory and depicts a happy family. Every time I look at this
particular picture, it gives a different sensation - mixture of happiness and
sadness. This is a priceless possession to me and I would like to keep it with
me for the rest of my life.  


**Alternative Answer:**  
There was a time when photos were only taken by regular point-and-shoot-
cameras, but now everything has changed. With the help of mobile phones and
computers, people are taking billions of photos everyday from all parts of the
world. I, myself, take so many pictures that I sometimes forget which
photograph I took and when I took it. There is this one photograph I like the
most. It’s just beautiful…  
  
In this photograph I am carrying my niece and she is smiling up at me. I first
saw the photograph about a week ago. I didn't even know the photograph existed
until my sister showed it to me. I liked it so much that I made it the
wallpaper background of my computer. Now, whenever I open the lip of my
laptop, the first thing I see is that picture.

The photo shows happiness. I think it was taken four years ago, and shows how
time has passed, how the world changes. After looking at the photograph, I
remembered that my niece was crying a lot and my sister was about to give her
to the nanny. At that moment I decided to step-in and hold her. Once I had her
in my arms she got happy and smiled. At that perfect moment the photograph was
taken. The picture shows a time when I was happy. It also shows at time when
we all used to have an optimistic outlook of the world but now all optimism
and love has just vanished from my life.  
  
The photograph was taken when I was only 4 years old. I was with my parents
and grandparents &amp; it’s one of my very favorite pictures ever. I do not
have clear memory regarding the event when the photograph was taken but I have
seen it a thousand times. To this day I still I look at it with delight and
sadness. I had it enlarged and framed; it hangs in the living room where
everyone can see the black and white. The small kid (me), the grandparents and
young parents make the picture a really significant one to me. I look with
amazement at the picture and sometimes I can't believe I was so small and
different looking at that time. The picture gives me a sense of melancholy
since my grandfather &amp; grandmother are no longer with us. In the picture
they seem so lively but I can't be with them anymore!  
  
I was wearing a long sleeve shirt, pants and a pair of red shoes. In the
picture I was in the middle, sitting on a chair. Others were standing around
me; my parents are on the right and my grandparents are on the left. My father
was very stylish and was dressed fashionably in the picture. My grandfather
was wearing spectacles and had his hair back-brushed. My mother and
grandmother were both wearing traditional dresses but both looked so fresh and
happy in the picture.  
  
This photograph is probably is my most favorite one as it conveys my
grandparents' memory and depicts a happy family. Every time I look at this
particular picture, I get the feeling of bitter sweetness! This is a priceless
possession to me and I would like to keep it with me for the rest of my life.  


###  Tips for answering this Cue Card Topic:

This cue card asks you to describe a photo/ photograph which is your
favouritre and where you have been. Do not get confused about the question as
you might get allured to describe photo of your father/ grandfather or a
friend. You should talk about the photograph where you were present. It can a
solo picture of your ort can be group photo where you were present.  
  
Try to describe a photo which is related to some short of memory. Following
are some of the ideas for such photographs:

  * Your childhood photograph.
  * Your birthday photograph.
  * Your graduation day photograph.
  * A photograph with your friends.
  * A photograph with your family members.

Describe who are present in the photograph, when this was taken, who took it,
how you have saved it, what memories it remind you and other aspects of the
photograph.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q: What do you think about 'Photography' as a career? **  
**Answer:** This question is equally interesting and difficult for me. My personal belief is that ‘Photography’ is a great occupation, not only because it is indispensable for many different fields but also because through it people can discover the world. To be more precise, by taking a photograph, the moment is frozen and the depiction is saved no matter what. Photographs decorate books, magazines, paintings and many other things. So, it's an essential vocation that is associated with other jobs, similar to it or not. In addition to this, photographers travel a lot across the world and see new places, landscapes, buildings and so on. It is something that apart from a profession is also a hobby and provides entertainment and spiritual education to photographers. As I see in my country the career of a good photographer is quite bright and full of possibility. With online journalism this has become even more demanding profession. 

**Q: What makes a good photograph?**  
**Answer:** Although I love taking pictures for a long time, I haven't been concerned with the details and technical aspects of photography thoroughly. But I would say that the most important part of a good photograph is the theme of the picture. For example, a beautiful landscape could make a photo really impressive by just having beautiful colours or scenery. Furthermore, the angle that the photograph is taken from is significant as well, because with technique a simple theme can become an attractive one. Furthermore lighting, focus on proper objects and use of right camera can made an ordinary scene to become a beautiful photograph. 

**Q: What are the improvements latest technologies has bought in photography?**  
**Answer:** Technology has contributed to tremendous improvements in photography and its storage and distribution. First of all, smart phones and iPhone have built in high resolution camera and that has make taking pictures easier and more convenient as people these days are no longer obligated to carry a professional camera with them to take pictures. Pictures taken from a mobile phone can be transferred and viewed in personal computers and can be stored online.  The photo editing software can not only change some basic characteristics of the photo taken but also the whole picture and can make it more appealing. With the help of technology and software an ordinary picture can be converted into a professional one without significant efforts. Technology has offered us advanced camera with more power and features and those camera can take pictures in extreme environment like in the water. I would say that camera, photography and presentation of photos with the help of technology has got a higher dimension. 

**Q: How often do you take photographs?**  
**Answer:** The truth is I used to take pictures very rarely in the past, but after I created my Instagram account, I've become accustomed to taking picture very frequently. I really like capturing every important moment and other significant events with my friends and family and sharing them with my online friends has become a common activity for me. That doesn't mean, of course, that I take pictures all the time but I try not to miss capturing worthy moments and sceneries. My Instagram account, which is photograph storage and photo sharing website, has led and inspired me to use my camera more frequently than ever before.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 37 - Describe an important invention

sample%2F620-ielts-cue-card-sample-37-describe-an-important-
invention&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

###  Describe an important invention that you think has positively influenced
human race.

**You should say: **

  * What the invention is
  * Who invented it
  * What changes it brought

**and explain how it has positively influenced human race.**

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * Mention 2 famous scientists in your country?
  * Why should we invest more in research?
  * What is the single most important invention in your opinion?

**Possible Answer:**  
It is really tough to pick one particular scientific invention that had
positively influenced human race as there are possibly hundreds and thousands
of such inventions. I would like to pick the '**Light Bulb**' as one such
invention that has very positively influenced human race.  
  
This single invention of science has uplifted the human race towards
prosperity and modern world. Think about a world without any lights in the
dark and we would have been no different than living in a cave. The great
scientist Thomas Edison is credited to invent the light bulb and till then
many improvements have been done to it.  
The bulb is the main source of illumination and light at night time when the
Sun is hiding in the opposite side of the world. We are so habituated with the
electricity and light bulbs that we might wonder if it is a life changing
invention or not.  
  
But think about living your life for few days without the bulbs and then you
would realize the true importance of this single invention. Some may argue
that fuel powered lighting system could have been alternative to it, but the
reality is that, that would have been too expensive and could not have been an
easy source for lighting the houses,  
Think about the other living beings other than human; they mostly get back to
their living place in the evening and except some nocturnal animals and birds,
most of them stay at their living place till the morning.  
  
They rarely do anything at night and that's because they are afraid of dark
and have no vision to see at night. As human, we could have some lighting
system if we did not know how to light a bulb but that would not have been so
widespread without the invention of light bulb. Scientific inventions are
interrelated and one invention or theory inspired and accelerates the
invention of other important inventions.  
  
Light bulb is one such invention that has inspired the invention and research
of other inventions. This is the single invention that has made us free from
being active only at day time when the sun is there.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card Topic:

This cue card should be an easy one if you can talk about any important
invention, a bit about the inventor and how this invention has affected our
lives. Note that invention and discovery are different.  
  
**Discovery** is exploring and finding out something that preexisted and nothing new to the world. Only people did not know till the discovery if it existed or not. Meanings of discovery are: to make known; reveal; disclose and from these meaning we can find that discovering means to reveal something of finding something that already existed but we did not know where. For instance, discovering America.  
  
On the other hand **Invention** is creating/ giving idea or making something
entirely new either using objects that preexist to create something entirely
new or to create something that is first of its kind. Meanings of invention
are: to come upon, to create. From the meaning we can say that invention is
creating something entirely new of its kind. To invent this new thing the
inventor may use preexisting materials but the final outcome has to be
completely new. For instance, we say invention of telephone.  
  
You would need to talk about a famous invention as the cue card asks you to
talk about that has positively affected the entire human race. Very
insignificant inventions may have affected some people of a certain geographic
location but there are many inventions like telephone, computer, television
have greatly affected the whole human race. So to perfectly talk about such
invention you should talk about such an invention that has affected the
lifestyle of the people of the world and are widely used in the world.  
  
Following are some of the most influential inventions that you can talk about.
Pick an invention and get some idea of this invention and practice talking
about it.  
  
1\. Telephone  
2\. Computer  
3\. Television  
4\. Automobile  
5\. Camera  
6\. Sewing Machine  
7\. Steam Engine  
8\. Light bulb  
9\. Paper  
  
There are several other important inventions in the history that has changed
the world. But in the above list you would notice that only the very common
inventions that we know from our daily use have been added so that you can
talk about these known inventions. Pick an invention and do some Googling. You
would get details information about the invention and you should take some
notes from those details to prepare for this cue card topic.  
  
If you can answer this cue card, you should also be able to answer the
following topics:  
  
**1\. Describe something that has changed the world.  
2\. Describe a tools or device that you know about.  
3\. Talk about an important invention of the history.  
4\. Describe an electronic device that you use.  
5\. Talk about an invention that has made our life easier.  
6\. Describe an inventor who has a great contribution to the world.  
7\. Talk about an electronic device that you use at your home.  
8\. Describe an important modern invention.**

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something special you want to buy in the future.

**You should say:**

  *  What it is
  *  What it is like
  *  When you intend to buy it

** And explain why you want to buy it.**

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * What makes things to be special to you?
  * What makes a brand trust worthy?
  * What are some of the famous costume brands in your country?
  * What electronic devices are more common in your city?

**Model Answer 1: **  
So, I’ve been asked to talk about ‘something special that I’d like to buy in
the future’, it’s quite tricky to know how to respond to this topic.  Should I
pick something that I’d love to buy, but isn’t realistic (like a rainbow);
something that I’d love to buy as a gift for someone else (treat my mum to
afternoon tea at a posh hotel) or something practical for me (I could really
do with a new pair of winter shoes)?  In fact, I’m going to go with the first
thing that popped into my head when you told me the theme – I’m going to talk
aboutsomething that I would really really like to buy, but haven’t quite got
around to yet.

I’m going to tell you what it is, what is like, when I intend to buy it and
why it is I’d like this particular item so much.

The special thing I have in mind is a photo book.  You can get them on the
internet I think.  You select a range of digital photos that are special or
meaningful to you, and then arrange them electronically with captions and
dates and so on.  Then there are specialist companies that will put them
together in a traditionally bound physical book.

The idea is quite a simple one, but genius.  In this age of digital cameras
it’s easy to take lots and lots of photographs, some are good, some are funny,
and some are indifferent.  Many are bizarre; others are hilarious; and some
are just terrible, but all of them are quite literally snapshots of memories.
However, because now photographs are everywhere,I think we take them a bit for
granted and don’t appreciate them as much as we should.  The really great
photographs get lost in the multitude of average or terrible ones.  There are
so many files of photos on my computer, that I can’t even remember what they
contain, let alone where the most important ones are stored anymore.  So what
I’d love to do, is take the time to pick out a selection that are really
important to me, and have them brought together in an album that I can
treasure and look back on, and share with others.  Honestly, nobody really
wants to look at 1000 pictures of your holiday/ family/ pet, but they might
like to look at half a dozen of each that had been carefully chosen to tell a
particular story, and it’s fun to share such memories.

When do I intend to do this?  Well, interestingly, I have a ‘to do’ list on my
desk.  One of the items that has been on it for some years is ‘sort through my
photos’.  I never get around to it.  Maybe now I’ve been made to reflect on
it, I should prioritise this task.  Just because it has never felt urgent
(that is, something I need to do immediately) this activity never makes it to
the top of my list.  However, it is important, I need to make time for it.
Maybe next week – I should give myself a deadline!

I hope you can see already why I’d like to buy this so much.  But if I need to
explain more, it is because I think by making a selection of really important
pictures, I can pick out special memories.  By putting these together in a
physical book I think they will endure longer and be valued more than if they
are lost in the millions and millions of images that fill the internet.  Even
today, I have on my shelves books that are over a hundred years old, they have
pages that have slightly yellowed with age, but are perfectly useable and
readable.  On the other hand I have a pile of floppy discs, I have no idea
what is on them anymore, and I no longer have a computer that I could read
them on, effectively, those contents are lost for ever.  Despite how clever we
are in this digital age, I have a suspicion that it is our books that will
outlast us all, not pixels in cyberspace!  What do you think?

**Possible Answer 2: **  
I have a personal list (wish list you can say) that has many things that I
want to buy in future. One such special thing that I want to buy in near
future is a personal car. I mostly use public transportation to move from one
place to another and to visit my hometown which is very inconvenient. Owning a
car would be a great advantage for me as I would be able to freely move and
visit my home town more frequently.  
  
The car I want to buy is the Fusion Hybrid car by Ford. This is a stylish
looking car which is also fuel efficient. My preference would be white colour.
I intend to buy it after 2-3 years as it would allow me to save the money and
apply for the car loan I need to purchase it.  
  
There are so many advantages of owning a car especially in the city I live in.
Maintaining the perfect timing is pretty tough if you travel in a public bus.
You would need to wait for the bus, stay in the long queue for a long. And the
frequency of the public buses and the number of people do not allow one to
maintain the timing one needs to keep. If I own my own car I'd be able to
avoid the usual bad traffic and take the alternatives roads. Travelling in a
public bus is inconvenient and you do not have any privacy in it. With my own
car I'd be able to go to my hometown and visit my parents more frequently than
I do now.

**Sample Answer 3: **  
I know exactly what the special thing is that I want to buy in the future.  In
fact, I’d like to buy it right now, as soon as I’ve finished talking to you
today!  I’m going to tell you what it is, what it is like, when I’ll buy it
and explain why it is I want to get it so urgently and so much!

The item is a spider catcher.  Have you ever hear of them?  They are a bit
tricky to describe, but basically, it’s a simple gadget that allows you to
pick up a spider without hurting or touching it, so you can release it
unharmed elsewhere.  There are different designs, but the one I like the look
of has a long handle with a trigger mechanism at one end which operates some
soft gentle bristles at the other.  If you believe the adverts, it works by
surrounding the spider with bristles that close around it, forming a harmless
trap, which allows you to pickup and release the spider without squashing it.
To operate it you simply squeeze the lever to open the bristles, position the
open bristles over the spider, then release the lever so they gently close
around it. You can then pick up the spider and release it somewhere else – a
long way away - by once again squeezing the lever to reopen the trap.
Apparently it doesn’t harm the creature, it also promises ‘no mess, safe and
easy to use’.

So that’s what it is called and how it is supposed to work.  I’d like to buy
it soon.  Why?  Because I have a completely irrational fear of spiders!  It is
very specific though, I don’t think I have true arachnophobia, I’m fine with
even very large spiders if they are outside, but there is a certain form of
house spider we have here in the UK which always makes me jump.  They are
quite large, they can grow to about 12 – 14 centimetres in size, and the males
become active in houses around autumn (October time).  At this time of year
they leave their webs in search of a female, and will move inside to the drier
environment of a house after a summer living outside or in sheds.  They prowl
about looking for female mates.  They move very erratically, and quite high up
on their legs, plus they have a tendency to loiter in corners or shoot across
the floor, where if the light hits them they cast a ridiculously
disproportionate shadow.  They can’t hurt you, and they are only looking for
love, but my how they frighten me if I just catch sight of one unexpectedly.
The reason I want to buy a spider catcher soon, is that I have just this
morning seen an ENORMOUS spider prowling about my living room.  I really don’t
like sharing my flat with him, even though he means me no harm.  Once you have
seen one spider there will be more, the next few weeks will bring many such
monster spiders into my home, and I want to be prepared!

Catching these spiders is hard.  One method I use is to put a glass or jug
over the spider, and then slide a piece of paper underneath so you can trap
the spider and let it go outside.  The problem with this method though is that
sometimes the spiders are too big to fit under a glass.  Also, they move so
fast, they can be gone before you get a chance to catch them, and finally, I
don’t really like getting so close to them in the attempt to get them!  The
spider catcher seems like the perfect solution.  I wouldn’t want to harm the
spider, it isn’t its fault I’m scared, but I’d prefer not to have them running
around all over the place either!  That’s why I really, really want a spider
catcher of my own.  It sounds like the perfect solution for fearful me, facing
a potentialparade of spiders stomping about when I’m all alone watching a
horror film on telly at night as autumn draws in!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an important decision/ choice that you made in your life.

**You should say:**

  *     What the decision was
  *     When you took the decision
  *     What the results of the decision was and whether it was a good choice.

**and explain why it was an important decision or choice for you. **

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * How parents' decisions affect their children's life?
  * What important things do you consider while taking a big decision?

**Model Answer 1:**  
Decisions, decisions.  I’m not always good at making decisions.  I worry about
making wrong choices, and often seek advice from friends to help me think
through the consequences of picking one option over another.  Mind you, some
people say that we choose who to ask for advice depending on what advice we
want to hear.  That might be true.  Some decisions are easy to make – perhaps
because all the possible options are good ones (like choosing a favourite
pudding) others seem to have no good options only ‘least bad’ ones, those are
hardest to make.  The important decision I can think of, and which I’m going
to talk about today, worked out in the end, but it was terrifying to have to
make at the time.

I’ll talk you through what the decision was, when I took it and what the
results were.  Finally I’ll explain why it was so important that it still
impacts on me today.

The decision was whether or not I should relocate to a different part of the
country to take up a new job.  I had to make the decision about 6 years ago.
I had been self-employed for a while, but then there was a downturn in the
economy and I stopped getting enough work to support myself.  I applied for a
job in Sheffield, which was a city I didn’t know at all, and when I had first
an interview, and then a job offer, I was faced with a big decision.  Should I
leave my home and friends to start a new life in Sheffield for a promising job
at a prestigious university; or should I stay where I was in my lovely house
and familiar surroundings, and hope the work might pick up again in the
future?

I thought a lot about the pros and cons; I cried a lot to be honest, as the
thought of making a new start was really scary.  I’d be all on my own, and
what if I didn’t make friends or couldn’t do the job well?  However,
ultimately it came down to income.  I couldn’t live on fresh air, and this was
well paid job.   I also thought if I turned the work down, and then didn’t
manage to pick up new contracts I’d always wonder ‘what if?’ or how might
things have been different if I’d just been brave enough to ‘give it a go!’
I accepted the job and started to pack.  In less than three weeks I was
renting a flat in a new city and turning up to work in a new office with new
colleagues.  One resolution I made early on, was to be really positive about
the decision once I’d made it.  I’d join societies, say ‘yes’ to every social
invitation, and really try to build a new life quickly.  I wouldn’t ever look
back!

The result of the decision?  Well, I moved to a new city, and took a new job.
It was hard at first, there was a lot to learn and sometimes it was lonely
too.  However, I’ve never regretted it.  Sheffield is a lovely city near to
beautiful countryside.  I rent an attic flat which has great views over the
city in one direction and woodland in the other.  I think this city must be
one of the friendliest ones in the UK, people were incredibly welcoming to me
as a newcomer, and there is always lots to do.  I don’t have that job anymore,
but I don’t regret taking it at all.  I do sometimes miss my old house in
Leamington where I used to live, but I don’t miss anything else.  I think the
move revitalised me and took me on a great new adventure, sometimes you do
just have to take a bit of a risk in life to progress, this bit of risk taking
worked for me.

So in conclusion, I think it was a big decision, but I made a good choice.  Of
course it was an important one as it changed everything for me, from where I
lived and worked, to who my friends are.  Honestly though, I think perhaps
with decisions it matters less what you decide, and more that once you have
made a decision you make the best of it, wherever it may take you.  Sometimes
the journey is speedy and smooth, sometimes it is rocky along the way, but
whatever path we choose, it is what makes us the people we are – for better or
worse!

**Possible Answer 2:**  
I've made lots of decisions in my life and frankly I have taken those
decisions sometimes all alone and sometimes discussing with my parents and
others. The particular decision that seems very important to me was the time
when I decided to major in Literature rather than major in Engineering. My
mother wanted me to get admitted in the Eng. University and do my graduation
majoring Engineering while my fascination was studying in Literature. I made
this decision when I was 18 years of old, just after finishing my 12th grade.
My father did not force me to do anything; instead he told me to do what I
thought was best for me. My relatives thought that I was a fool and too
immature to make a big decision for myself.  
  
But after considering several issues and perspective I decided to get myself
admitted in a University that offers graduation in Literature. I'm happy that
I made this decision. I'm yet to finish my graduation but throughout the last
3 years I have enjoyed studying literature and I am doing quite well
academically.  
  
Making the decision/ choice was not easy and I had to go through a hard time
as I remember. I had to fight a lot with my inner self and then convince my
mother. There were always risks of picking the option I prefer my parents
would have complained if I hadn’t make a promising result. I still remember
the dubious feelings I had that time. Sometimes it seemed to me that I should
abandon my passion and yield to my parents' decision and then again I strongly
felt for my own choice and passion. Since I made my own choice at that time, a
strong urge and force worked on me that I have to do really good and I am
happy that I took my decision and doing very good so far.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

Remember a decision that you took which turned out to be an influential thing
you decided. You should be able to talk about something you decided and later
proved to be useful and beneficial. This varies from person to person yet
following are some of the ideas you can adopt to talk about yours one:

  * Your decision to get admitted into a college, university or studying in a particular major/ subject.
  * Your decision of living in a foreign country.
  * Your decision of taking a course or learning a thing.
  * Your decision of taking a part-time/ full time job.
  * Your decision of making a change in your family like: living in a town rather than in the village.
  * Your decision of obeying your parents on certain issues.
  * Your decision of not getting involved in a political party/ organization that eventually turned out to be harmful for others.
  * Your decision of helping a person/ people of your locality.
  * Your decision of informing a bad thing happening in your locality to the appropriate authority.
  * Your decision of protesting a decision taken by your relatives.
  * Your choice of imposing something to your family members or friends which later turned out positive for him/her.
  * Your decision of buying something that letter become helpful for you and others.

Try to talk about something positive you decided. You are free to describe one
of your decisions which become harmful for you later but it is advisable not
to talk about such negative things.

If you can talk about this cue card you would also be able to describe:

**1\. Describe something you did and felt good for that.  
2\. Describe something you did for others.  
3\. Talk about a choice you made in your life.  
4\. Describe a decision you took that later affected your life.  
5\. Talk about an incidence when you got confused.  
6\. Describe an important choice you had to make in your life.**

leisure-time&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe what you usually do in your leisure time.

**You should say:**

  * What you do
  * Who you do it with
  * Where you do it

**And explain why you like to spend your free time this way.**

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * What are some constructive leisure time activities? 
  * How leisure time activities have changed in the last 10 years?
  * What type of activity you would suggest to your kids?

**Possible Answer: **  
I have classes 5 days in a week, I attend a diploma course on Computing and I
do some tutions as well and all of those activities and my study make my days
busy. However, I maintain some leisure activities and in my off-day I go
through a different routine.

I love to read books and maintain my own blog. Whenever I get time either I
read books or write/ moderate my blog. Besides reading and writing for my
blog, I play some indoor games with my friends and family members like chess,
computer games etc. If it's an outdoor game, I play with my neighbours or
friends.

I read book mostly in my study room and sometimes in the nearby library. I
work on my computer to update my blogs. I mostly read fictions and historical
books. The blog I maintain is mostly technology related and I add the details
with images for my blog readers. I have made 2 of my friends moderator and
they contribute in the blog as well.

I like to utilize my leisure time and enjoy very much what I do. Reading books
is the most prudent investment of leisure time and I learn many things from
reading. Maintaining a blog is a great way improving the writing and sharing
knowledge and that helps me greatly to explore new things as I need to read a
lot to generate ideas to write.

The indoor game like chess is a great way of passing time and also helps doing
some brainstorming. I take part in the outdoor games to both enjoy the game
and to keep my body and mind fresh and fit.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What types of leisure activities are popular in your country?

Q. Why it is important for people to have time for leisure activities?

Q. Why are some leisure activities more popular than others?

Q. Are the types of leisure activities that are popular today the same as
those that were popular when your parents were young?

Q. What types of leisure activities may become more popular in the future?

Q. What type of leisure activities helpful for children? Why?

Q. Some people do not have any leisure activity. Why it is the case?

###  Tips for answering this cue card question:

Pick a leisure time activity that you usually do. You can talk about one of
the following topics or the one you really do:

  * Take your parents or children outside for walking.
  * Play indoor games like chess, computer games etc.
  * Go out for walking, running or for other form of exercise.
  * Take care of the garden you have.
  * You visit your friends and spend time with them.
  * You watch TV, movies or listen to music.
  * You learn something like song, musical instrument, cooking, dancing, sports, art etc.
  * You do some freelancing jobs.
  * You write for your blogs and surf internet.

  * You spend time with your family members, help them on household chores etc.
  * You actively participate in social works.
  * You go to the nearby park or open space for fresh air.
  * You have a hobby and you spend time for that.

Not necessarily you have to talk about one particular thing you do in your
leisure time, you can say a combination of things you do in your leisure time
like sometimes you surf internet, sometimes you go out for a walking and
sometimes you spend time with your family members and help them on their
tasks.

People usually do their leisure activities from their interest, passion and
need. So describe your reasons for doing things you do in your leisure time.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a thing that you possess and which is important to you.

**You should say:**

  *     What is it and who gave it to you
  *     What's the specialty of it
  *     Would you ever give it to someone else

**and explain why it is important to you.**  
  
**Follow-up Questions:**  
  
    What are the changes of city between now and past?  
    Does money represent happiness and why?  
    How do you regard as the things people want to earn?

**Possible Answer:**  
My cell phone is very important to me as it helps me communicating my friends,
family members, teachers and gets me connected with the people I care. I use
internet in my cell phone, check my mails, update my blog, track the
statistics of my website, send and receive SMS, play games, listen to music,
take pictures and then share in my Facebook, Google plus and twitter profile.
Besides these I do lots of other things in my cell phone including using
important apps, reading e-books, using it as a modem to use internet in my PC
etc. My father game me the money to buy a cell phone and I bought the HTC
desire X cell phone from an authorized seller. So my father actually gave the
mobile phone to me.  
  
This smart phone has versatile usages and is very special to me. I spent a
significant time with this device and some of them are very positive for me
like updating my blog and reading e-books. This is a small device with
approximately 6.5 x 4 inch dimension but it is a powerful tool and the
internet connection in it makes it even more powerful. The first and foremost
specialty of this device is that it lets me get connected with my family
members and friends. Second, it is an amusement and recreational device that
lets me play games and listen to music. Third, I can update my social
networking profiles and get updates of my friend right from my cell phone. I
had to go to a cyber cafe to check an email or to send one before I purchased
this smart phone. Now I have this handy device that I can easily use to
connect to internet. Since this is an android OS device I can download many
application and tutorials and learn new things. Sometimes I take photos and
then share it with my friends. Communication has become so easy and convenient
with the help of this cell phone.

Yes, if needed I can give this device to someone who I care about but I will
then have to own another one. It's not like I will give this cell phone to
someone and then would stop using any cell phone or switch to an ordinary
phone. What I mean is, I can give this particular phone to someone but can't
stop using a Smartphone.  
Technological advantages have made things easier especially communication and
my cell phone is a really unavoidable and inevitable device to me.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a bad weather experience you have had.

**You should say:**

  * what sort of bad weather it was
  * when it happened
  * where you were when it happened

**and explain how it affected you.**

**Follow up Questions:**

  * What are the main seasons in your country?
  * What environmental changes have you noticed in your country?
  * What should we do to protect the environmental pollutions?

**Model Answer 1: **  
Well, I am from England, and in England we love to talk about the weather!  It
changes all the time, and so it’s actually quite hard to think of one specific
example of bad weather that I have experiencedthere.  Even so, I can recall
one particularly extraordinary day, when bad weather brought my city of
Sheffield to a standstill.  I am going to tell you what the weather was like,
where I was when it happened and how it affected me I still shiver as I recall
it!

The bad weather was snow.  It does snow in parts of the United Kingdom every
year, and where I live in Sheffield we do always get some snow in the winter
months, especially on the higher ground. I quite like snow, it can be cold and
a bit inconvenient if you get a heavy snow fall, as then public transport
stops and everything grinds to a halt.  However, it is also really beautiful
how a snow fall can turn everything white.  It is fun to build snowmen, make
snow angel shapes in the newly fallen snow, to go sledging in the hills and
even to have a sneaky snowball fight if you are brave enough to find someone
to take on.  So on the whole, I like snow, I enjoy the novelty of it, and as
long as you are dressed appropriately (hat, gloves, scarf, waterproof trousers
and thick winter coat) it isn’t too bad.  The day I’m thinking of, though was
rather different.

I woke up on a December morning about four years ago and the first thing I
noticed was that it was really really quiet.  It is hard to describe if you
have never experienced it, but after a thick snowfall, everything sounds
different.  The sounds that you normally hear are changed by the muffling
effect of the snow, but also there was no sound of traffic.  The snow had
fallen so deeply, that cars were stuck in driveways and buses in their depots,
the only way to get about that day would be on foot.  I was lucky, because I
only lived about two miles from work, so I could still get in.  I pulled on my
wellington boots, and waterproof clothes and headed off into town.  I quickly
discovered that this was not like any normal snowfall.  The snow had fallen
feet deep onto ice, it was really treacherous even trying to walk in these
conditions.  Where I live in Sheffield, it is incredibly hilly.  Snow ploughs
had cleared the major roads, but this had exposed dangerous thick black ice
underneath which was impossible to walk across.  The combination of ice and
steep slopes meant that I was sliding around everywhere and so was everyone
else.  Although at first it was quite comical, watching people skidding about
and falling over, after a while I started to be quite anxious, it was
dangerous, you couldn’t even stand upright.  I got to one road crossing at the
top of a hill, and the road was so slippery the only way to get over it was to
literally crawl across on my hands and knees.   The other side of the road a
complete stranger was lying down and reaching out to pull people across
safely.  It was so bizarre, I have never seen anything like it before or
since.  The roads were thick ice, but the pavements were piled high with
drifts of snow up to three feet deep, I thought I’d never make it to the
office that day let alone home again by nightfall!

My normal walk to work would have taken me perhaps 30 minutes, but on this day
it took over three times that long as I had to negotiate the tricky roads and
paths.  When I got there, I found only a couple of other people had made it in
as well.  Most people had looked out of their windows and decided it was far
too dangerous to attempt the journey.  I think they were right!  My manager
had made it in, but he quickly decided it was silly to stay, we all still had
to get home safely somehow, and it was still snowing outside.  I was working
at a university at the time, and for the first time in its history it was
declared closed, it was ridiculous to expect staff and students to make the
trek in – I should have stayed in bed!  We stayed at work long enough to phone
people to cancel appointments and confirm we were shut, and then I had the
same long trek home in the snow again.  I was exhausted by the time I got
back!

It was quite an experience, it made me appreciate how much we should respect
the elements. I felt safe at first because it was an urban environment, and
usually we don’t get much disruption due to bad weather there, but really the
snow and ice made it unnavigable for the next few days.  I suppose in
countries where they always get a lot of snow and ice they are better prepared
for it when it comes.  We were certainly taken by surprise.   That was my most
memorable bad weather adventure.  It was fun in a way, but I wouldn’t welcome
that every year, plus it was freezing.  It’s hard to keep smiling when you are
so cold!I still love the snow – but I respect it a lot more than I used to.

**Possible answer 2:**  
The experience I would like to talk about took place 4-5 years back and I was
a college student at that time. One day I heard that my uncle is sick and my
parents asked me to give him a visit. Since my college was closed at that
time, I decided to go to my uncle's house. The journey towards my uncle's
house took me 7-8 hours and I had to take a bus, then a boat and finally walk
for 2 kilometers to reach the house.  
  
The place was in a remote urban area and there was no direct bus or train
communication there. However, the journey I took to reach there was enjoyable
and I had good times at my uncle's house. I was glad to see him getting well
and spent some quality time with my cousins. After 2-3 days I said goodbye to
my uncle, aunt and cousins and took my journey toward my home. They were
convincing me to stay few days more but I could not as my classes were due to
start.  
  
I left my uncle's house at 3:00 pm and the weather was cloudy. The weather was
comparatively good even when I got on a big boat to reach the town to pick a
bus. But after 30 minutes or so, the sky all of a sudden became intimidating.
The lightening and the sound of it gave an impression that a heavy rain is
approaching. But instead of rain a devastating storm hit in and the boat-men
failed to control the navigation of the boat. People became so scared that
they started praying to God. I was very frightened as well.  
At a point I started feeling that the boat might sink and I might never reach
home alive. The storm showed no signal to calm down and the powerful wind
blowing was trying to take away everything from its way. The wind was blowing
from every side and we could not see anything nearby or distant.  
  
The boat-men yelled and asked us to hold something strongly and get prepared
to swim to the nearby land if needed. I knew how to swim but I found 2-3
persons were crying as they did not know how to swim. Their screaming made the
situation even worse and I felt a strong urge to stay alive. I am not sure how
long this shattering storm lasted but to me it seemed for eternity. Later I
found that, the strong lasted for about 40 minutes and the boat has reached to
a completely different place. By the time the storm has pacified, we were
grateful to be alive. We found 1 woman and a kid have become sick and were
vomiting in fear and for the sudden impact of heavy storm. I reached to a
highland and sat on a shop for about 15 minutes to realize what just happened.
I have some other bad weather experience but no other one was a life threat as
this one was.  
  
After I reached home, I did not tell my parents about it. I told them the
truth after 1 week. I will never forget the experience I had on this way back
journey from my uncle's house.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card Topic:

To describe a bad weather experience  you need to talk about both the bad
weather and your experience of this bad weather. A bad weather can be a heavy
rain, show, storm, stormy wind, flood, heavy tide in a river etc. Do not talk
about natural disaster like earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption, accident
in the road as they are not usually a bad weather. Note that you must describe
how you got stuck in to this weather and what happened to you. Do not talk
about about a bad weather experience you heard from someone as this cue card
asks you to talk about your own experience. However you can say that because
of the bad weather you were stuck at home and suffered a lot. But talking
about a journey you took and faced a bad weather would be a better answer for
this cue card topic.  
  
Following are some of the ideas to help you talk about this cue card:  
  
1\. You took a journey and all of a sudden the bad weather appeared.  
2\. You did not have any option to quickly get to a safe place.  
3\. The weather so was devastating that it was life threatening.  
4\. You were stuck in this bad weather for more than 2-3 hours.  
5\. You were bit frightened and you found people were afraid as well.  
6\. When you left home, the weather was perfectly okay but all of a sudden it
changed.  
7\. After the devastating experience ended you were so relieved.  
8\. This is an experience you will never forget.

If you prepare for this cue card you should also be able to answer the
following cue card topics:  
  
**1\. Describe a bad experience of your life.  
2\. Describe a natural disaster you have seen.  
3\. Describe a bad journey you have had.  
4\. Talk about one of your memorable events.  
5\. Describe a storm you have seen.  
6\. Describe a journey you wish you did not have.  
7\. Talk about an experience when you felt helpless.  
8\. Describe one of your frightening experiences.**  


**Sample Answer 3: **

It was probably July of 2010 and it was a rainy reason when I had to
experience a bad weather and the experience was so bad that I still remember
it clearly. Our local area was a comparatively low area, and the rainy reason
often caused us trouble.

It started with heavy rain and the rain continued without any cease for a
week. This causes the roads and fields overflowing by waters. We knew that the
rainy reason has started. One night we wake up suddenly in the middle of the
night and felt that something is wrong. I noticed that the water has reached
at our house and was approaching to our floor. I was bit afraid and called my
mother. Our entire family members wake up and within an hour the water was all
around the room.

There was nothing to do and we found that people in our locality have wake up
and had been busy to move their furniture to safe places. In the meantime the
water level has reached to well over our floor and most of our furniture was
staying in the water.

I was not quite grown up then and I felt a great anxiety because of the sudden
hit if the flood. My parents tried to console me and assured me that we will
be safe in few hours. But my gut feelings told me that things are not going to
be okay. I felt helpless and prayed to God so that he takes away the water
from our house. This was the first time when I noticed the devastating form of
the flood. As it was the first flood experience in my life, I could not
imagine what was happening and how would we get away from it. The night was
sleepless and the next morning we took the valuable furniture and other
belonging to one of our relative’s house who stayed at the 6th floor of a
building. We kept the rest of the furniture in our house in the flood water.

My parents sent me to my grandfather’s house which was in a different city
where flood did not hit and after few days they also came there to get rid of
the flood. We stayed at our grandfather’s house for about 15 days and returned
home after the floor water decreased and went away.

**Follow up Questions:**

Q. What are the main seasons in your country?

Q. What environmental changes have you noticed in your country?

Q. What should we do to protect the environmental pollutions?

###  Part 3: Discussion topics:

**Q. What should you do in a bad weather?**

**Q. What is the relationship between weather and culture?**

**Q. The climate has changed these 50 years. Have you noticed the changes?**

**Q. What changes do you predict in the following years?**

**Q. Are the people interested in gathering the weather information in your place?**

in&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a hotel you have stayed in.

**You should say:**

  * Where the hotel is
  * Why you stayed at that particular hotel
  * Give details description of the hotel and the view from it

**and explain what makes the hotel special. **

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * What are some good hotels in your city?
  * What are the difference between staying in a hotel and staying in a relative's house?
  * What qualities make a hotel a good one?

**Possible Answer 1:**  
Is it cheating if I tell you about a Bed and Breakfast I stayed in rather than
a hotel?  I’m going to risk it, and tell you all about a place I stayed on
holiday, what it was like and why it was so special to me.

Many years ago I lost my job.  I’d been covering a post while someone was on
maternity leave, but then they came back and I found I didn’t have a job.
Anymore.To cheer me up, two good friends of mine suggested we went away for a
weekend break.  One of them had found a really nice Bed and Breakfast in
Anglesey, which is an Island off the coast of Wales.  Nowadays it doesn’t feel
so much like an island anymore because it is permanently attached to the
mainland by the very famous ‘Menai Bridge’.  She chose the place partly
because of its spectacular location – it is surrounded by sea - but also
because it was vegetarian (we all were too) and offered horse riding, which
was a hobby we had in common.

The B&amp;B as we call them in the UK, was, well, pretty eccentric.  It was a
lovely old house, with quirky rooms, dubious cleanliness and an assortment of
dogs, cats, hens, ducks, ponies, people – pretty chaotic.  From the house you
could see across the Menai Straits, the stretch of sea between Anglesey and
the mainland, to the snow-topped mountains of Snowdonia.  It was glorious.
The proprietor was one of those people who very much spoke her mind, but took
you as you were, she quickly involved us in life on her small holding, feeding
animals, heading off to the beach and drunkenly putting the world to rights in
front of an open fire in the evening.  We walked the dogs, fed the hens and
galloped the horses along deserted beaches.

When the woman who owned the B&amp;B found I didn’t have a job, she said quite
simply ‘well, why don’t you come and work for me?’  I was flabbergasted, I’d
never really considered that sort of a job, and I’d come on holiday not
looking for employment.  I hesitated, but she persisted.  ‘If you like it you
can stay, if you don’t you can leave – where is the risk in that?’  To cut a
long story short, with unusual spontaneity and recklessness I agreed.  For the
next two years I worked at the B&amp;B looking after the horses and guests,
taking out rides along the beautiful Welsh beaches and enjoying a rural
lifestyle.  It was brilliant, I learned a lot about animals, people and
myself, and had many adventures along the way.  I didn’t earn much, but I
lived well in a caravan in the middle of a field with hens clucking around
outside and ponies scratching their bottoms on the door of my accommodation in
the mornings!

So for me, that remote Anglesey B&amp;B will always be very special, because
it introduced me to a different way of living and working, and gave me an
appreciation of the countryside that I hadn’t really been able to experience
before.  I don’t think I’ve ever laughed as much doing a job as I did staying
there!

**Possible Answer 2:**  
The hotel that I stayed in 2 years back while my visit to India is Westin. I
had an official tour to Pune, India and my office arranged the stay in Westin.
The reason I stayed in this particular hotel is mostly because my office
arranged our stay there. But that was a really great experience. Since Westin
is a renowned hotel chain and I have experienced their superb service in our
country, I was excited to be in Westin in Pune as well.

The hotel has been placed in a distinctive location in the beautiful Koregaon
Park along the Mula Mutha River, and is just five kilometers from the airport.
Westin is also in the vicinity is Magarpatta and Hadapsar, an information
technology hotspot. Industrial parks lie within a 25-kilometer radius of this
hotel. The staying rooms are subtly designed and give comfort to be there. The
hotel includes club rooms, attractive and heavenly spa and workout gym,
meeting room and exclusive restaurant. The rooms feature soft and comfortable
bed and a eye-catching views overlooking green surroundings Mula Mutha River.

The Westin is a renowned hotel chain that offers exclusive customer
experience. The view, the stay, the foods and facilities makes the hotel a
different experience.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

You need to describe a hotel where you have stayed. If you pick a famous
hotel, your description should be close to the original facts regarding this
hotel. But you are free to pick a hotel and give a superficial description as
well. Mention the name of the hotel first and then tell your reason for
staying there. People usually stay at hotels when they visit a place where
there are no relatives present. Sometimes they go to a foreign country or a
distant city of the same country and stay at a hotel. The stay usually lasts
for few days and then people take their departure after the intended task is
done. You can mention a trip you took and stayed in hotel or maybe you can
state that your office arranged a business trip and picked the hotel for you.  
  
**Describe the following information to answer this cue card correctly:**  
  
1\. Name and location of the hotel. If this is 4 star / 5 star hotel, mention
that as well.  
2\. Specify the reason you stayed there.  
3\. How long you stayed there.  
4\. What type of room you stayed in and the facilities you got from the hotel.  
5\. Mention if this was the first time you stayed there or went there before.  
6\. Say if you have stayed there on your own choice or because the trip
planner, office authority arranged that.  
7\. Give some interior and exterior description as well as the surrounding of
the hotel.  
8\. There must be some distinctive points and things about the hotel; mention
those. For instance: the food was delicious, the cost was very reasonable,
they offered some free services, the location was excellent, the staffs were
very cordial etc.  
  
If you can answer this cue card topic you should also be able to answer the
following topics:  
  
**1\. Describe a building that attracted you.  
2\. Describe a tour you have taken.  
3\. Describe a hotel which you like.  
4\. Talk about a hotel in your city that you would recommend to others.

when I saw a little angel was crying on my mother's lap, I became the happiest
man in the world. I was the only son of my parents and when I heard that I
will have another sibling, I got very excited and I was counting days when
this brother/ sister of mine will come. I speculated and imagined lots of
things I would do with my sibling. The day that my sister came in to the world
was one of the happiest days of my life.

For the first time I felt a strong urge to kiss this little fairy child. She
was so beautiful and adorable that I thanked God for the gift. My mother asked
me to hold her and kiss her but I was afraid to touch her as I thought that
might hurt her. I felt like I was flying on that day. My mother gave birth of
the baby in a hospital and I was so happy and attached by the event that I
denied returning home at night. I stayed in the hospital cabin for about 4-5
days till my mother and sister came home. I came back home with the most
precious gift of the world.

planned-to-visit&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a foreign country you have planned to visit.

**You should say:**

  * Where the country is
  * When you are planning to visit there
  * Why you have planned to go there

**And give details of your planning to visit the country.**  
  
**Follow-up questions:**

  * Say something about the tourism development in your country, facility, services and the effect on environment.
  * What is the importance of travel and tourism industry?
  * What do you think the function of tourist guides?
  * What steps should Government take to make the Tourism more attractive to foreigners?

**Possible Answer:**  
I have planned to visit Greece after my graduation is done. I have a relative
there and he has invited me to visit his family several times. Earlier this
year when I was promoted to the final year of my graduation, I have planned to
visit at least one foreign country just after my graduation day. I have
considered many countries and finally planned to visit Greece. It is a country
in southern Europe and has around 11 million populations.  
  
I have planned to visit Greece in the middle of the next year and would stay
there for about one month. The relative I have there is my maternal uncle and
he lives at Athens with his family. There is a good chance that I will be
staying with them during my visit there. Greece is a culturally rich country
that offers the visitors and tourists a lot of amazing activities, splendid
sceneries, museums, diverse culture and many more. The museums, archaeological
sites and the tours offer the chance to closely know the history of this
country. The islands are the main characteristic of Greece’s morphology and
have become a big part of their custom and culture.  
  
There are 2-3 main reasons I would like to visit the country. First, the
invitation to visit my maternal uncle has been pending for several years and I
thought it a good chance to meet them. Second, I am a big fan of mythology and
Greek mythology was one of my most interesting readings for the last few
years. Those stories have been so profoundly entertaining and thought
provoking and suddenly I found a great desire to visit the place in person.
Though things have changed there with time but the archaeological sites and
museum would walk a visitor though the past and present and would amaze them.  
  
This is an ideal place to stay and enjoy. This is a country of crossroad color
of culture, history, diversity, warmth of friendliness, expectation, discover
and expedition. For all those reasons I have decided to visit Greece in the
next year.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card Question:

Talk about a country other than yours. If you have already visited a country,
you can talk about this country but mention that you want to visit it instead
you have visited it. Talking about a country that you know about would give
you some advantages to talk about it. This cue card asks you to talk about
your planning to visit the county not the details of the country about it. So
mention mostly about your planning and few details about the country itself.
Most of the people know more about the neighboring countries so you can also
talk about your neighboring country.  


As part of your planning mention some of the following things:

  *  I have been planning to visit this country for a long. 
  *  I will go there with my friends /family members and all of us looking forward to be there. 
  *  We have surf internet to know about the interesting and famous tourists spots there and we have a rough planning about the places we will visit and the things we will do there.
  * One of our relatives stay there and that's why it would be easier for us to get help there. 
  * This is already a famous tourist’s destination and we will stay there for more than 2 weeks so that we can extensively travel there. 
  * We are attracted about the culture and custom of this country and would definitely enjoy our stay. 
  * As part of our planning to visit this country we have already done a rough estimation and planned our budget for it. 
  * We have heard about this country and their culture and tourists spots.

Your preparation for this cue card would help you answer the following cue
card topics as well:  


**1\. Describe a country you want to visit in the future. **

**2\. Describe a foreign country you have visited. **

**3\. Talk about your plan to visit a famous historical place. **

**4\. Describe your idea of visiting a foreign country. **

**5\. Describe a city you have visited. **

**6\. Talk about a foreign culture you know about. **

**7\. Describe one of your neighboring countries. **

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an important letter that you received.

**You should say:**

  * Who wrote it to you
  * What the letter was about
  * How you felt about the letter

**And explain why it was important to you.**

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * What are the difference between email and hand written letters?
  * Will the hand written letters become obsolete in the future? Why?
  * Why should we write letters to friends and relatives?
  * What are the important qualities of a good letter?

**Possible Answer: **  
Though People mostly send emails now-a-days for official and personal
communication, the handwritten letter has its own importance as well. Today I
would like to talk about a hand written letter that I received when I was 14
years old. This particular letter was written by my father and I was so
excited to receive it that I read it several times. The letter was about the
scholarship result and my father wrote me to inform me that I got the
scholarship. In his letter he congratulated me and wrote that he was proud of
me.  
  
I was staying at a relative’s house after my final and scholarship exam with
my mother and sister and one day I found that a post office peon delivered a
letter to my uncle. My uncle handed over me the letter as it was addressed to
me. I found that it was written by my father. I read the letter quickly and
was very excited to learn the news. I read it again and then informed my
mother and relatives about it. My mother read it and congratulated me as well.  
  
As a kid, the scholarship was very desiring for me and when I found that my
father was very happy, that made me happier.

**Alternative Answer 2:**  
The most important letter that I have received ever is the one that was posted
to me from the Falcon University confirming that I have been accepted in their
B.B.A  program. I can't exactly remember the name of the person who wrote it
to me but it was from the Falcon University admin department.  
  
I was simply overwhelmed about the letter as I have been dreaming for a long
to do my graduation in B.B.A specifically in the Falcon University. The letter
was the confirmation that my dream has come true and my hard work and
determination have been paid off. I felt like flying in the sky. I let my
parents and close friends know about the acceptance and they were happy too.  
The letter was written in the official pad of the Falcon University and signed
by the head of the B.B.A admission department. There were only 4-5 paragraphs
on the papers and they were printed either they were very exciting for me. I
read the letter twice and kept it in a nice place as if I was hiding a
treasure.  
  
The letter was utterly important to me as it expressed and confirmed that my
dream about studying in the Falcon University has come in to reality.

**Sample Answer 3:**  
Today I am going to tell you about a letter that was very special to me.  I
will tell you who wrote it to me, what it was about and why it made such an
impression on me that I can still remember it over forty years later.

It is quite interesting to have to think of an important letter that I’ve
received.  Nowadays it is really rare to get a letter in the post.  Most
business and personal communications seem to happen by email or even text
message on a mobile phone.  However, believe it or not, there was a time when
that was the only real way to communicate!  Even so, as a small child in the
days before the internet, for me to receive an actual physical letter,
carefully folded in an envelope and being delivered to me with my name on it
unopened was a really special event and very rare indeed.

When I was seven years old I had to go into hospital to have my tonsils taken
out!  I was very sad, and very frightened to be in hospital, and I didn’t
really understand what was happening to me or why.  To make things worse I was
going to be in hospital for my eighth birthday.  At that age I hadn’t ever
really received any letters especially for me before and I certainly didn’t
expect to receive any post whilst I was ill.  Therefore, it was a wonderful
surprise one morning to be given an envelope with my name and address
beautifully hand-written on it and bearing a stamp from overseas in the top
right hand corner.  I was so excited!

The letter was from my Uncle Peter.  He was living in America at the time, and
I was in England.  He had sent me a special letter for my birthday.  That was
exciting enough, but what he had done amazed and impressed me.  He said he’s
wanted to send me a birthday cake, but that wasn’t practical over such a
distance, so instead he drew me a picture of an amazing birthday cake and a
whole party with balloons and presents.  So his letter was to wish me a happy
birthday, and to cheer me up because it is horrible for anyone to be having an
operation at any time, let alone on their own birthday when they are just
eight years old!

I was in awe!  He was actually quite a good artist, so his illustration was
really good, and the letter cheered me up and made me feel so special.  I kept
the letter for a long long time, but sadly one day I couldn’t find it anymore,
and I think it must have been thrown out at some point.  Even so, I think this
letter was a start of a great correspondence between me and my, to me,
‘exotic’ uncle who lived overseas.  He and I continued to exchange letters
over the next forty years, right up until the time he died.  His were always
hand-written, though mine moved over to being typed, but we never resorted to
email, so the ritual of a letter thudding through a letter box and onto the
welcoming doormat of home continued between us long after many others had
abandoned such an old-fashioned form of communication.

So the letter was very important to me because it cheered me up when I felt
low and made me feel special.  It also began a correspondence that continued
over four decades.  Even today, I still think nothing beats a ‘proper’ letter,
and I will always try and send a personal note to friends or family when
something important has happened.  I love the excitement of seeing a postmark
and an unknown stamp on anewly arrived envelope and the anticipation of
wondering who a letter might be from and what they have to say. For me,
nothing beats the physicality of a letter in your hands and when I post a
letter or card myself I always like to imagine the recipient similarly
examining my unopened missive and hopefully looking forward to making a cup of
coffee and settling down to enjoy the contents!

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 27 - Describe a musical event in your country

country&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a musical event in your country.

**You should say**

  * What the event it is
  * Where it takes place
  * What kind of music is played

**And explain why you enjoy it.**

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * What type music is famous in your country?
  * What are influences of western music in teenagers in your country?
  * Why music is important?
  * Which one is more important: traditional music or western music?

**Possible Answer 1:**  
I’m going to tell you today about a major musical event in my Country, which
is England in the UK.  I’ll tell you what it is, where and when it takes
place, the sort of music and why I think it is so significant… even though I’m
not sure I’d really say I personally enjoy it!

The event I want to talk about is the BBC Proms. This is an annual summer
festival that has been taking place since 1895 so is a well-established
fixture in the UK.  The festival is of orchestral classical music, the main
focus of the festival is the impressive Royal Albert Hall in London, which is
a huge domed venue that seats over 5,500 people.  As well as the daily
concerts there are lots of satellite events in schools and parks, over the
eight week period there are probably more than 100 concerts.  Some dedicated
‘Prommers’ will get season tickets and attend as many of these as they can.

I’m not entirely sure why this concert season is known as ‘The ‘Proms’. I know
Prom is short for Promenade concert, and I suppose originally these were
outside events where people could stroll around (promenade) whilst the music
was playing.  Now, within the hall itself, I don’t think strolling around is
approved of!  However, unusually for classical concerts, at the BBC Proms,
there are lots of extra tickets made available for standing only. These are
comparatively cheap tickets allowing concert-goers to stand in the arena and
gallery areas of the hall.  Consequently, the concerts are always packed and
accessible to far wider audiences than is usual for classical music which is
often too expensive for ordinary people to afford to attend.

Although The Proms go on for eight weeks, the really famous event is the
closing concert or ‘Last Night of the Proms’.   This is always televised and
sometimes big screens are put up in parks across London so people who couldn’t
get tickets to the event can still watch and join in with the atmosphere.
Traditionally this closing concert is quite raucous!  People will dress up in
patriotic costumes and wave union jack flags.  This last concert in the series
is usually quite light in tone, with popular classics in the first half,
followed by rousing British Patriotic pieces in the second half which many
audience members will join in singing with gusto!  The sequence traditionally
includes pieces by English composers such as Elgar’s ‘Pomp and Circumstance’
and Arne’s ‘Rule Britannia’ and usually concludes with a rendition of
‘Jerusalem’ and the British National Anthem.  Informally, post-concert,
audiences often spontaneously break out and sing ‘Auld Lang Syne’ but it isn’t
a formal part of the program, rather a newly emerged tradition.

For many, the Last Night of the Proms is quintessentially English.  A display
of patriotism and a celebration of English Music and traditions.  Tickets are
extremely hard to come by and although the preceding eight weeks of concerts
are really aimed at classical music aficionados, the last night is certainly
widely watched and enjoyed.

For my own part, I have to admit a little sheepishly it isn’t really my thing.
I sometimes feel uncomfortable with all the displays of patriotic fervour and
think some of the sentiments expressed are rather old-fashioned and
inappropriate.  Even so, it is an impressive tradition, and if you were a
visitor from overseas who happened to be in London in the second week in
September I’d definitely encourage you to get along and experience it if you
could.  You will see English pomp and ceremony, hear British composers and be
amazed at how even the stereotypically reserved British, can indeed sometimes
be persuaded to come out to play!

**Possible Answer 2:**  
There are several occasions and places in our country when musical events take
place in my country. I'd like to talk about a particular music event that
takes place in my home town and this takes place in the beginning of the
spring. The event runs through 3-4 days and in 2-3 phases. In the first phase
the local music bands and individuals perform and complete in the event. At
the end of the competition 3 bands/ individuals are selected and are awarded.
This is an important event as it makes the participants famous in the country.
This event is broadcasted in local TV channel and in Radio. This event takes
place in the city hall auditorium. Thousands of music lovers and people attend
the event to enjoy the music and the competition. Several kinds of music are
played and among them classic, rock, folk and contemporary songs are most
famous.

In the second phase some famous singers and musicians perform their own songs
and people enjoy this very much. Lots of people from different parts of the
country come to attend the show and enjoy the music.



I have attended the event several times and enjoyed every time to be there.
The event attracts lots of people and a festivity goes on surrounding this
event. I enjoy the music, the gathering and the festivity of this event.  


####  Tips for answering this Cue card topic:

Talk about a ceremony or festival in your country when music is played. This
can be a national program, religious program, a local or traditional program
or can be a theatre or seasonal program when some kind of music is played and
people sing. Tell the program name, type of program, time of the year or
season when it is performed and where it is performed. If this is a local
program, it held on your locality and if this is a religious or country wide
program, then you should mention the significance of this program.  
  
After you tell about the program name, type and time, you should then talk
about the reasons you know this program and why you enjoy it. Since this is a
music program, you do enjoy it because of your love for the music and
festival. If the musical program is rooted to religious or patriot reason, you
should mention that as well.  
You should avoid describing a stage program or a concert that can occur
anytime of the year and has no great deal of importance nationally or locally.
But think about any program which takes place in your locality in every summer
and people enjoys it or any national program which takes place in every year
and a lot of people participates in the musical program there.

Your preparation for this cue card would also help you answering the following
cue cards:

**1\. Describe an event you attended and enjoyed.  
2\. Describe a musical program which you attended.  
3\. Describe an important event of your locality that you know about. **

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 40 - Describe a shopping center you often go to

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a shopping center you often go to.

**You should say: **

  *  where the shopping center is
  *  how often you go there
  *  what it looks like

**and explain why you often go to this shopping center.**

**Follow-up Questions:**

  *     Will smaller shops survive in the current business system?
  *     What are the characteristics of shopping malls and smaller shops and their difference?
  *     What is the trend of future shopping centers?
  *     Talk about Internet shopping

**Model Answer 1: **  
This topic is quite difficult for me to speak about.  It depends which bit of
the subject is most important.  You see, for me ‘shopping centre’ implies a
big commercial area like a mall with lots of chain stores and possibly out of
town.  In fact, there is one outside Sheffield - the city where I live – it’s
called ‘Meadowhall’ – but people locally refer to it as ‘Meadow-hell’ because
it is vast and soulless.  Some people love it, because there is a huge
selection of branded shops, but personally, I hate going there.  I don’t
really enjoy going shopping for the sake of it, and for me the centre lacks
character.  Therefore, if you want me to speak on the topic of a shopping
centre that ‘I often go to’ it would never be a large mall or retail centre as
such, it would be quite, quite different.

I’m therefore going to tell you about a different sort of shopping centre that
I go to often.  I will interpret ‘shopping centre’ as the place at which I do
most of my shopping, and hope that that will be good enough for you!  I will
tell you where it is, how often I go there and why.  I’ll try to convey
something of its characteristics and explain why I end up nipping over there
several times a week.

The shopping centre is about 2 miles up the road from where I live.  I could
walk there, but when I go I’m usually heading there to do a big food shop and
other errands, so I tend to take the car, or sometimes I’ll walk up and catch
a bus back.  The shops are in a sort of village at the edge of the city of
Sheffield, it’s called Fulwood.  I go at least once a week to do my food shop
at the local co-op mini-supermarket store, and I also visit the post office at
the same time.  However, there are other little shops there too – a newsagent;
a florist; a green-grocer who sells high quality fruit and veg and a really
good hardware store for household storage and cleaning items.  These are all
quite handy, so sometimes I’ll just nip over to buy something specific like
new batteries for a clock or bin-bags if I’ve let myself run out – I can be
there and back in 20 minutes if I take the car.  I probably end up going to
the shopping area twice a week on average.

Why do I go?  Because it’s near; the shops cater for almost all of my general
needs; and because it’s local to me the staff know me.  Sometimes they’ll have
a chat in the post-office when I go to send a parcel and in the co-op the
woman always gives me a double discount if she can (I have some special
loyalty cards but I don’t always remember to have them with me so she gives me
the benefit of the doubt).  I also think that because most of the people who
work in the shops own them (they are all small businesses) you get better
service.  The proprietors care very much about their customers, and they
appreciate you coming back as a regular.  It is a much friendlier and more
personal experience than I’d get at a big anonymous out of town mall.   Also,
if I’m honest, because there aren’t that many shops were I go, I probably save
quite bit of money.  There is no temptation to impulse buy anything
extravagant, or to sit down and have a cup of coffee every few yards either!

Sometimes I need things that I can’t get locally, like clothes or perhaps
electrical items, and then I do have to grit my teeth and go into town, or
head to the out of town mall -  although I also do some of that kind of
shopping on the internet these days.  Anything to avoid the retail nightmare
of Meadowhell – perhaps I’m just too old for that these days!

**Possible Answer:**  
The shopping center that I often go to and would like to talk about is
(.._.tell a shopping center's name from your city.._..). This is the largest
shopping center of the city and is probably the most popular one. This
shopping center is at the middle of the city and is 20 storied. You can find
almost everything in this shopping center and the price and quality of the
products make it a popular shopping mall where people from all classes come to
shop. You name it and you can find it here; from grocery shop to 3d cinema,
food court to play ground, gym and thousands of shopping shops are there. The
market authority imposes a strict rule about the quality and price and that's
why you can find products at a reasonable price here. The neat and clean
environment, the rigid security, the arranged shops and shopping convenience
are the main reasons I visit this shopping mall very often. There is a
dedicated floor only for social gathering and there you can sit and talk to
your friends as long as you like.  
  
I go there almost 2-3 times in a months. If there are more shopping to do or
before any festival I go there more than 2-3 times. I go there not only for
shopping but also some times for social gathering, party, to have lunch or
dinner or to watch a movie.  
  
There are many positive reasons why this shopping center is popular among the
visitors and shoppers including security, reasonable price, shopping
convenience, position of the shopping center, and convenience of parking, open
space and neat environments. The interior and exterior of the shopping mall is
very attractive. In the front of the building you will find a large open
space; like a big park or garden. You can seat there for a long and no one is
going to ask you to go away!

###  Tips for Answering this Cue Card Topic:

This cue card should be an easy one for you to talk about as you already know

This shopping center has more than 500 stores and I can get almost everything I need to purchase from there. The prices are reasonable and good quality products could be found there.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a positive change in your life.

**You should say:**

  * what  the change was about
  * when it happened 
  * describe details of the change happened 

**and describe how it affected you later life.**

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * What changes do you want to make in your life?
  * Do you believe we can control our own fate? How?
  * What three changes you would want to see in your country?

**Model Answer 1: **  
You have asked me to think back on some change I’ve made in my life, that
turned out to be one for the better!  I am going to tell you what the change
was and when it happened.  I’ll give you a bit of detail about how things were
different for me after the change and finish by describing what it means for
me now, a bit later in life.  
The funny thing about changes, is that you don’t always recognise them at the
time.  For me, I didn’t know when I started out that the positive change I was
making would turn out to be a long term difference in my behaviour.  However,
it turned out to be just that.  It is only looking back now that I can
identify there was a definite shift in what I got up to, and I can even
pinpoint a definite time, but in the midst of it all I had no idea where that
change would take me.

The change was basically that I decided I needed to get a bit fitter, and the
thing that helped me do so was joining up to do Parkrun.  However, I’m jumping
ahead.  Let me explain how it came about…  A couple of years ago I started to
feel like I was getting old and losing my basic fitness.  Although I walked
quite a lot (as a form of transport, as well as to enjoy the local
countryside) I wasn’t really doing anything else very much that was physical.
I was never very good at sports, so I didn’t really know where to begin.
However, I’ve always liked being outdoors, so on something of a whim I booked
an activity holiday in Northumberland, which is a beautiful rural area in the
north east of England, right by the coast.  The holiday was great.  We did
abseiling; hill walking; body-surfing – all sorts of things.  In addition,
every morning began with a run along the sands of the seaside.  Now I’d never
run before – well only if I was trying to catch a bus, but otherwise, not at
all.  I wasn’t very good at it, and honestly, I didn’t even really enjoy it
all that much.  However, I did have to concede that it is a great form of
exercise.  You don’t really need any special equipment (apart from decent
trainers); you can do it anywhere and it’s free!  What’s more, I found out
from some other holiday makers that in the UK there is a free weekly event
held nationwide in parks all over the country.  It is called Parkrun, and
basically people gather every Saturday morning at 9.00 a.m. to run a fixed
course of 5km and get a time for doing so.  I wasn’t too sure if this would be
achievable for me. I’d never run that far before.  But I promised myself I
would try it ‘just once’ to see if I could.

The day after I got back from my holiday I turned up to do the Parkrun at my
local park.  I can tell you the exact day!  It was 24th August 2013 – I know
this, because the whole point of Parkrun is that if you register (which is
free) then the organisation records your time each week and you can access it
on line afterwards.  The first time I went I didn’t even manage to run the
whole way round, but I did finish, and I did get a great sense of achievement.
Because you know your time, it is quite addictive, you find you do want to go
again the next week and see if you can improve!  My local parkrun is huge,
with well over 500 runners taking part every week – so even though I was
pretty slow, I found I wasn’t the slowest.

Since that day over two years ago, I’ve found that I’ve gone to Parkrun almost
every week.  I have taken part in some 70 parkruns, and through doing so made
new friends, maintained a certain level of fitness, and even gained the
confidence to take part in some longer runs.  I’ve done lots of 10km races
now, a few off-road runs – including one over 24km as well as taken part in
obstacle races!  I would never have believed that the small change of ‘just
going once’ to Parkrun to ‘give it a go’ would lead to me being such an
enthusiastic member of Parkrun two years later.  By the way, I haven’t really
ever got any faster, but I’m definitely a lot fitter.  Now I can’t imagine a
Saturday morning without heading off for a run with my 500 friends at the
local park!  That first day I turned up nervously to join in with Parkrun was
definitely the beginning of a positive change in my life!

**Possible Answer 2:**  
The positive change that I would like to talk about is ‘I started playing
outdoor games instead of playing computer games’. After I got my first
personal computer when I was only 9 years old or so, I started learning many
things. Besides that I started playing the computer games. As computer games
are addictive I found that I was playing the games whenever I had spare times.
This addiction barred me from playing outdoor games like cricket, football
etc.  
  
I found myself very much attracted to the computer games and I preferred to
play the games at home instead of going to open spaces or fields to
participate in outdoor games that involve physical exercises. Not that
computer games are all so bad, but playing them all the time someone has got
is not a good thing especially for kids. I found that I was spending more
times at home than being outside. After my parents noticed that, they
discussed with me about that and explained me the importance of outdoor
activities. They gave me strict restriction that I would only be able to play
computer games for an hour daily and in the evening I’d have to go outside to
play with my friends.  
  
This was obviously a very positive change for me. I’m not against computer
games but I feel that if there are more important things to do, then we should
not spend time on computer games only.  
  
This change affected me very positively. I became a good cricket player later
on, I started maintaining my times more prudently and I am sure this change
has affected me positively in terms of physical and mental health.

Answers Submitted by our students:

**Answer 1: **  
I have started focusing on me and have started exploring a new me and that is
a very positive change for me. For the last 20 years of my life I was a
typical girl who never thought for herself and did her duties and
responsibilities for others.

Time was going on and my life was also going on with time in a very banal way.
There was no value of time, value of life, value of thought. Only there was a
tough routine that I had to follow and dedicate myself for others. I do not
have any complaints dedicating me for the benefit of others, but that was so
typical that I forgot my own existence and my own dreams.

  
My dreams were surrounded by someone special. It’s all about someone whom I
loved more than my life. But the moment I realized that with whom I nurture
all of my dreams, is lost in a very different world where I do not have
special place, I was broken and shaken up. That realization initially gave me
a feeling of being a looser and helpless one.  It forcefully pulled me at the
end of the world and I totally lost my confidence, believe in believing and
did not seek any reason to live.

  
In that regrettable moments, I never stopped thinking and I asked questions to
myself even when I was asleep. I was started regaining my confidence after I
started realizing the fact and reality. I was determined to hit the sky and
not to feel like a looser.

I will never forget the great contributions my friends had overcoming this
fatal time and they advised me why I have to love myself and explore my own
dreams even after someone has shattered my dreams. They helped me to get out
from my dilemma. They reminded me who am I, who could I be I.

  
The perception of life, reality and dreams seems like have changed in me and I
am happy for the changes. It has helped me find the reality, a new me. Now I
love myself even more with my every possibility and dream. Now I am taking a
journey to look forward and reach a definite goal I have. I don’t know where
it would go but I learnt to walk alone, confidently and I love my own
reflection.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  A famous person you know in your country.

**You should say:**

  * Who the person is
  * Why he is famous
  * What makes you mention specifically him/ her

**and describe what positive changes this person has brought for your country.**

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * What makes people famous?
  * What are the differences between a famous person and an ordinary person?
  * Tell about one internationally famous person in your country.

**Model Answer 1: **  
Ooh, I thought at first the cue card meant someone I know personally, or had
actually met!  That would be really hard, I’m not very well connected.  Erm,
there are so many famous people in my country – England, part of the United
Kingdom.  I could pick the Queen, I think she is one of the most recognised
people the world over, but I think that’s too easy and predictable.  I’m going
to pick instead a famous person from English history, you may never even have
heard of her, but she is really important in terms of contributing to
political change in my country, and although perhaps not everyone knows her
name, most people would know about what she did.

I’ll tell you who the person is, why she is famous and what makes me choose
her.  Finally, I’ll try and explain how she has contributed to positive change
in the UK.

This person is Emily Wilding Davison, she was born in the 1870s and died,
famously, in June 1913.  She is famous, or even infamous, because she was a
militant activist who fought for women's suffrage – that is for women to have
the same rights to vote as men - in Britain.  She was one of a number of women
who protested in different ways about the inequality that existed.  At that
time, only men were allowed to vote in elections, something that seems
incredible today.  Some of the protestors took direct action, leading to them
being arrested and imprisoned for their views.  Once imprisoned, some took it
further and went on hunger strike, leading to them being force fed – Emily
herself was jailed on numerous occasion – nine I think, and force fed nearly
fifty times.  The reason though, that she is particularly remembered amongst
the many women who campaigned so vociferously, is that it was her who
apparently died for the cause.  On 4th June 1913, she stepped out in front of
the King’s own horse when it was racing as part of the famous race the Epsom
Derby (this horse race still takes place each year today).  She suffered fatal
injuries, and died a few days later.  There was a huge public funeral, and
thousands of suffragettes accompanied the coffin and tens of thousands of
people lined the streets of London.

People have different opinions about whether she actually intended to kill
herself, or just to disrupt the race to bring attention to her cause.
Personally, I think she would have wanted to live on to continue her protests
and contribute to the debate, but her life was cut short aged only 40 years
old, by accident.   I have chosen her, because I think she was a brave and
principled woman.  I might not approve of all her actions, but without her
efforts, and people like her, women would not have ultimately gained the vote
in this country, which I consider to be a basic right.  Women fought hard for
that equality, so I think it’s very important that all people (men and
women)exercise their democratic right to vote.  It was a right that was hard
won but potentially easily lost.  Democracy is an imperfect system, but it the
political one we have in the UK, and I believe women and men should have equal
influence in how it is executed.  It takes courage sometimes, to stand up for
what you believe in, and her courage cannot be disputed.

It is hard to say that any one action or person brought about the
enfranchisement of women, but certainly her actions on that day brought the
debate about women’s equality to centre stage.  It led to more men supporting
the campaign, widening the voices of arguing for equal rights and over time.
Some women got the vote in 1918, after the first world war, but only those who
were householders over the age of 30 (6 million women); women over 21 did not
get the vote until 1928, so perhaps it’s only then you can say there was
equality.   She therefore contributed to the positive change of bringing about
equal rights in voting for men and women in the UK.

Over time in this county, people have come to take the right to vote for
granted, I think the contribution of the suffragettes in general and Emily
Wilding Davison in particular might come to be forgotten over time.  I was
pleased therefore to hear that a new film is coming out on exactly this period
of history, it’s (unsurprisingly) called ‘Suffragette’!  I haven’t seen it yet
– I wonder how close it will be to the truth of those times – perhaps we’ll
never know!

**Possible Answer 2:**  
I am from Australia and Hugh Jackman is one of the most famous persons in my
country. His full name is Hugh Michael Jackman and he was born in 1968. He is
a famous and critically acclaimed actor, producer and revered superstar for
his superb performance in TV, film and musical theatre.  
  
He is well known for the superhero character Wolverine in the X-Men series and
his leading roles in many well-known movies like Australia, Kate &amp;
Leopold, Les Misérables, Van Helsing, The Prestige, Real Steel,  and
Prisoners.  
  
I mention specifically him because I’m a big fan of his acting and
performance. I have seen almost all of his movies and TV serials and consider
him to one of the world’s most prominent actors alive.  
  
He was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and graduated from University of
Technology, Sydney, in 1991 with a BA in Communications.  
He is a philanthropist and is an active supporter for micro-credit. He is also
one of the founders and the global advisor for the Global Poverty Project.
Besides he is an ambassador of World Vision and participated in the climate
week NYC ceremony.  He is also an active supporter and donator for different
charity and social welfare programs.  
  
Through his acting, fame and donation he is trying to fight poverty and is
trying to help the people in need. That’s a great way of extending hand for
people in need and can be exemplary for others.  
  
He is a world renowned actor and is revered by his countrymen. Through his
acting he has increased the impression of an Australian born actor and through
his charity and philanthropic activity he is helping others.

experience&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a life changing experience.

**You should say:**

  * where it took place &amp; who was with you
  * what happened
  * how it made you feel

**and explain how it changed your life.**

**Model answer:**  
I was only 6 or 7 years old then and went to visit my grandpa in our village.
I had lots of cousins and many of them were similar to my age. Visiting the
village was very exciting to me. One day I along with my cousins went to play
in the evening and all of a sudden we decided to catch some fished from the
nearby pond. We had no hook or net to catch fishes so we decided to do it with
our bare hands.  
  
There were no people around so no one was there to warn us. As we did not know
how to swim and had no idea about the depthless of the river, we lost control
and all of a sudden I found that I and my cousin were trying to get out of the
water. We already got ourselves trapped in the deep water and were struggling
to breath. I barely remember what happened except that I was trying with my
last effort to fight with water and get into the land. I can't recall how much
time had spent but suddenly I found that I was lying on my mother's lap and
was trying to find my cousin who faced the same fate as I did.  
  
Later I heard that both of us were almost sinking in the water and a old woman
came to rescue us. She was a village dweller who came to take water from the
pond and had noticed us. She single handedly rescued me and then my cousin.  
  
This event was a life changing event for me. After that event I learned how
important it is to stay closer to parents and to heed to their advices. I also
learned how fleeting our lives are and we out to help each other. From then I
also started respecting all sort of people from all ages and always believed
in human. When we are in danger, human (known and unknown) would come to
rescue us. So we should never disrespect the human and always keep faith on
them.  
  
Tragic part is that, the grandson of the old woman who saved us died in the
water of a river. Knowing it I started strongly believing in fates and then
the tests we are bound to face in our lives.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card Topic:

This cue card expects you to talk about a very important event of your life
that changed your perception of life or changed the path of your life in some
way. Do not just talk about an important event in your life that has nothing
to do with the changes of your life.  Usually we have such life changing
experience in our teen ages but there is no hard and fast rule that it would
happen in your teen ages only. A simple experience in a later part of life can
simply change the life.  
  
The changes in life can be either a positive change or a negative change.
Because of a disaster, accident and wrong decision, the life can turn to a
negative change. If you want to talk about such negative change, mention the
event first, then say how it happened to you, who was there, how you felt
about that and what negation changes it made in your life.  
  
Alternatively positive changes comes from self realization, positive thinking
or experience, a great help from someone, something lucky or miraculous etc.
For this scenario, you should mention the event, how it affected your
thinking, who was with you, how you felt and what positive changes it had made
in your life.

**Ideas for talking about such life changing experience:**  
  
1.    **Positive life changing experience:**  
  a)    You realized something valuable and a morality and thus you started
practicing it for good. For example, you saw an accident and found out how
fragile our life is. Then  you started leading you life in a positive way.  
  b)    You were selected in a course and later on this training and education
helped you shape your career. Example: Computer Graphics course, Auto
mechanics, electronics work etc.  
  c)    You learned something out of interest and that has helped you earning
money.  
  d)    You once helped someone and he/she showed his/her gratitude by helping
you back.  
  e)    You understood that you family is more important and that changed your
daily routine.  
  f)    Diseases of someone you saw /heard have helped you leave a bad habit
of yours.  
  g)    You started adopting better life style.  
  h)    You started helping others.

2.    **Negative experience that can also change the life:**  
  a)    An accident  
  b)    An economic disaster  
  c)    Natural Calamities that affects the life  
  d)    Death of a relative and family member  
  e)    A negative and bad habit

If you can talk about this Cue card topic you should also be able to answer
the following topics:  
  
**1\. Describe an important lesson you learned in your life.  
2\. Describe a bad experience you have in your life.  
3\. Describe a memorable event of your life.  
4\. Describe something that affected your life.**

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your favourite animal.

**You Should Say: **

  *     What kind of animal it is
  *     Describe it briefly
  *     Why you like the animal

**and describe why it is your favourite animal.**  
  
**Follow-up Questions:**

  *     What do you need to do to take care of it?
  *     What’s the future trend of the animal?
  *     How do you think of the poaching of some precious animals such as pandas?

**Possible Answer 1:  
**Today I am going to tell you about my favourite animal, what it is, where it lives, when I first encountered it and why I like it so much. 

I like lots of animals, so it is difficult to choose just one.  However, I
think my favourite animal is the Warthog.  Warthogs live in Africa, they are a
sort of wild pig.  They get their name because they have four fleshy bumps on
their faces, which look a bit like warts.  These are part of the defence
mechanism for males when they fight.  Some people think warthogs are ugly, but
I think they are lovely, they have great character.

I was lucky enough to spend some time volunteering at a property in South
Africa.  At the property, there were three young warthogs which had been
orphaned after their mother was poached – killed for food.   The baby warthogs
were therefore hand-reared.  When they were old enough, they were set free to
run around in the wild.  However, because they were so used to people they
preferred to stay nearby.

These three warthogs were very friendly, intelligent and loved to play.  They
also like to follow their leader.  In the wild, baby warthogs will run after
their mothers, these three young hogs used to follow us. They would run after
us even if we were in a vehicle or on a horse – once they even tried to follow
the landowner when he took off in his helicopter!  The pigs (as we started to
call them) loved to be scratched and cuddled, they were very affectionate.
They were also very nosy, whatever we did, they wanted to be with us!

I love warthogs, they are energetic, loyal, and funny and I think they are
beautiful too.  Though I do understand the saying ‘beauty is in the eye of the
beholder!’

**Possible Answer 2:  
**My favourite animal is cow and it is much more beneficial than other animals. It gives us milk which is a nutritious protein supply for us. It provides us meat and the leather equipments are made from its skin. In some countries, the cow is used for plowing the land and for faming purposes. The teeth and bones of this animal are sometimes used to make comb, buttons and other useful things. In some areas, the dung is used as fertilizer and to burn fires.  
  
The cow is a four footed animal and its skin is thick. Grass is its main food
and they are mostly domestic animals. I like this animal mostly because of its
closeness to human and its usefulness for us. In my childhood we had 5-6 cows
at our home and they were very friendly. They had been very helpful for us. I
like it as it is very gentle and sober animal. I also enjoy when I see a cow
is ruminating and giving milk to her calf.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a sporting event you attended.

**You should say:**

  * What kind of sport event it was
  * Give details of this event
  * How often it takes place

**and explain why you consider this event to be interesting.**

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * What is the most popular sporting event in your country?
  * Why sporting events are important?
  * What short of games and sports do you take part?

** ****Model Answer 1:**  
I attended the Asia Cup final cricket tournament that was held at Dhaka
Stadium in the year 2002 or 2003. We went to Dhaka to watch the game and
stayed at a hotel during this time. I had 3-4 friends and a cousin with me
from the very beginning. We had had our ticket almost 3 months before the game
started. On the day we left the hotel early morning and took a taxi to reach
near the stadium. We found a huge crowd there; in fact the crowd was much more
than we anticipated and expected. I found one of my friends wearing the jersey
of a team and others whistles. The crowd and their patience in the line gave
the impression how much popular this game over here.  
I had a flag with me of the team I supported. We had to stay in the line for
about 45 minutes before we finally entered in to the stadium. I simply became
overwhelmed with the sheer number of spectators and their festivity and
support for the game.  
  
The game started at 10.00 am and the people were enjoying it very much. The
game was really enjoyable and I found supporters for both of the team. The
crowd, the music, the competition, the excitement of the game, and the
liveliness and spontaneous actions of the spectators were noteworthy. After
the first team ended their innings, we went outside and were looking for a
hotel to eat. But people were everywhere and there were no seat in the hotel.
Finally we got an empty hotel after walking almost 20 minutes and sat there to
have our lunch. We returned to the stadium in 35 minutes and the second
innings started. Several TV channels were broadcasting the live game and the
number of people watching this very game in the world would not be less that
70 million.  
  
The first team scored 280 and that was a good fighting score at that time. The
second team started hammering the bowls from the very beginning. It seemed to
me that they would not need more than 30 overs to win the game. But they
started losing wickets and in 20 overs they lost 3 wickets. The spirit and
excitement of the spectators looked like a waving sea. The team I was
supporting started doing really good. In the evening the game started turning
in favour of the first team and became very close. Cricket is a game of
uncertainty and this game became even more competitive and uncertain. Both
team had the chance to win and the game was changing in every 10 minutes. The
last 30 minutes were breathless and extremely exciting and finally the team I
was supporting won the match.  
  
This event takes place once in every two years and the schedule and venue is
selected and maintained by the ICC. This was my first experience to visit
Dhaka as well as watching such an exciting match. I have watched few other
cricket matches in the stadium, but none of them was as exciting as this one
was. The crowd, the enthusiasm of the people and the superb weather made it an
interesting one.

Sample Answer 2:

Gosh, this topic is hard for me, I don’t really go to many sporting events,
and it isn’t especially an interest of mine.  However, I can think of one
which enticed me to go and watch, I’ll tell you as much as I can about the
event, how often it takes places and why it was, to me at least, interesting!

The sporting event I went to was Le Tour de France – except it wasn’t!  For
one year only the opening stages took place near to where I live in South
Yorkshire, but more of that later.

The event is a world famous cycling race.  It takes place every year, in a
series of stages which are mainly in France, but it does occasionally pass
through other countries.  I think it started around 1903, and has taken place
each year since then – apart from during the two world wars when obviously it
was suspended.  The cyclists are professional riders, and the tour is
gruelling.  The route changes each year, but always includes both hilly and
mountain stages, fast flat sections and covers a huge distance of some three
and a half thousand kilometres over about 23 days.  I am told there are about
20 teams or so each year, each with nine riders.  To be honest I get very
confused about how it is all timed and organised, but I do know that for each
stage, the rider who has completed it in the fastest time gets to wear a
yellow jersey for the next stage of the tour.

The race has fallen foul of cheating over the years, famously Lance Armstrong
who won it some seven times I think was later banned for drug taking.
However, more recently cycling has cleaned up its act and gained in
popularity.  In 2014, a decision was made to have the Grand Depart – the start
of the Tour de France in South Yorkshire.  This part of England where I live
has fantastic scenery and very, very steep hills that were deemed suitably
challenging of the super-fit and competitive cyclists.  Although I’ve never
previously been interested in cycling, some of my friends are, and with such a
world famous event happening on my doorstep I wouldn’t have wanted to miss
out.

On the day of the race itself lots of roads were closed.  I met up with some
friends and we caught a tram as far out of the city as we could, and then
walked the final stages to a good viewing point along the route.  I had no
idea what to expect but it was amazing!  The weather was gorgeous, and
Yorkshire and Sheffield folk had turned out in droves.  I think about 2.5
million of us lined the route over the weekend it was passing through.  I
climbed up a bank and hung onto a tree to get a good vantage point as the
cyclists raced through in the peloton (a new word for me that I learned whilst
spectating).  To be completely honest, the actual cyclists passed by in an
instant, what made the event fun to watch was the build-up and the atmosphere.
The race was led by a convoy of floats and support vehicles.  There was lots
of good natured banter and sharing of food and snacks as the crowds waited for
the bikes to come, and plenty of people in hilarious fancy dress on French or
cycling themes.  Bunting was hanging everywhere, and brightly painted yellow
bikes were scattered along the route.  The weather showed off our Yorkshire
hills and scenery at its very best, it was awesome!

I was really proud to be one of the supporters on what was a once in a
lifetime opportunity to see The Tour de France passing through practically on
my doorstep (I live in Sheffield).  The race director for the event later
described Yorkshire's Grand Depart as the "grandest" in the 111-year history
of the race, it was wonderful to be part of that… it hasn’t made me want to
take up cycling though – those hills are ferocious!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe one of your neighbours.

**You Should Say:**

  *     When you two become neighbours
  *     Do you often meet?
  *     State whether your neighbour is a good person

**and explain why you like/ dislike this neighbour.**

  
**Follow-up Questions:**

  *     What is the difference between neighbours and friends?
  *     How do you think of the relationship in the city?
  *     How to improve the neighbourhood?

**Model Answer 1: **  
I’m lucky, I’ve got good neighbours.  I’m going to tell you about just one of
them, when we met, how often we meet and why I think he is a good neighbour
who I like very much.

I live in an old house which has been converted into about eleven different
flats and bedsits. I live on the top floor, which is actually the modernised
attic space of the original building, there is just one other flat in this
roof area.  To get to my flat, and that of my immediate next door neighbour,
you have to go up a back stairway that was probably originally the servants’
staircase, I think what is now my flat and that of my neighbour’s too, must
have been at one time servants’ quarters.  This means that our doorways are
directly opposite one another, and we are the only people who use this
entrance to the building.

I moved into the flat I live in about five or six years ago now.  It is a
rented flat.  At that time the flat opposite me was empty, but a few weeks
later I met a woman a little bit older than me who was busy cleaning just
inside the flat, but with the door wide open.  I paused to introduce myself
and talk to her.  She was really friendly, and I found out it was her son who
was to be my new neighbour, she was just helping him to move in.   A bit later
he, Oliver, turned up too.  He was new to the area, so I explained where all
the local shops were, when the rubbish was taken out and various other little
details about the practicalities of living in the property.  A couple of days
later he knocked on my door and called round for a chat.  We found we got on
really well.  We have a very similar sense of humour, a shared (but slightly
half-hearted) interest in running, and a mutual appreciation of good food – I
could recommend the deli over the road to him as a source of lovely upmarket
cheeses, olives and home-made lasagne and delicious pasta and pesto sauce too.
We also both have an unfulfilled wanderlust, always plotting our next journey.
He is off to Australia soon, lucky him!

Given how close we live together, our front doors face directly onto one
another, we see each other incredibly rarely.  We both have busy lives,
working full time but different hours.  At weekends I tend to be out and
about, and he’ll often disappear for the weekend to stay with his girlfriend.
Even so, whenever we do meet, it is always friendly, we make each other laugh.
We often end up having long conversations just chatting in the hallway outside
our front doors.  I probably see him only once a fortnight or so, but we leave
each other notes too from time to time if we need help with anything.

Oliver is a great neighbour, because I know I could call on him if I needed
to.  We will always help each other if we can.  I dug his car out of the snow
for him once as he didn’t have a shovel, but he’s returned the favour in other
ways, taking in parcels for me when I’m away for example.  Because I live on
my own it is really important to me to have a neighbour close by that I trust
and like.  I was really sad when he told me he was planning to emigrate.  I
was also really pleased for him, you have to wish someone well when they are
following their dreams.  I hope my new next-door neighbour is half as nice!

**Model Answer 2:**  
Mr. Andrew John (_...use a common name of your country..._) is one of the
neighbours whom I like very much. Since I live in an urban area, people are
close to each other and maintain a strong neighbourhood relationship unlike
the metropolitan area.  
  
In our neighbor, we know almost each and every people living there, what they
do, what are their updates, what are their profession and their overall
personality and characteristics as well. Mr. John's house is adjacent to ours
and I meet him almost every day.  Mr. John is a retired army person who is now
around 50 years old. He lives in his house alone and I have never found his
relatives visiting him except some old colleagues. He stays inside his house
most of the time and in the evening he sits in the veranda. He is a quiet man
and likes to read a lot. I have seen him coming to live in his house almost
5-6 years ago. He bought the house from our previous neighbour.  
  
I had had several conversations with him and I often play chess with him. I
like to read as well and our reading habit was the primary reason we started
liking our accompany each other. I like and admire this man very much. Though
at first impression he seems to be an arrogant person, but in reality he is an
intelligent, calm, good-hearted and charming man. I have heard lots of stories
from him. He has travelled to many different places and has lots of
experience. Since I have become close to him, he refer me books that I mostly
enjoy reading. He advises me whenever I seek for his guidance. He is sometimes
a close friend, sometimes a mentor and sometimes a guardian. I like him
because of our unclaimed friendship, his personality, honestly, morality and
his great mind.

experience&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a memorable childhood experience.

**You should say:**

  * who was with you
  * where it took place
  * what you did

**and explain why it is memorable.**

**Model Answer:**  
Childhood is a time when everything is magical and pleasant. The possibility
and dreams are vast and things become happier in childhood. Everybody has
childhood memories and among them some are pleasant and some are sad. I have
various childhood memories and I would like to talk about my childhood memory
related to my first day at school.  
  
I was about 5 years old when my parents got me admitted in a local school. I
had a fascination of going to school from 3-4 years as I recall and when my
father finally announced that I'll get admitted in the coming January, I felt
like being in heaven.  
  
I imagined school would be a great place and I would have lots of friends and
I would study there. On the day, my parents took me to the school that I had
saw many times from outside but never entered. After entering the school, I
find myself anxious about everything.  
  
I was unsure what to do, who to talk to, what to do when the teachers would
ask questions and many such things. After my father submitted some necessary
papers and fees to the admission department, they gave me new books, a
temporary Identity Card and a syllabus. I started feeling comfortable after I
found that some of our neighboring kids were already in this very school and
they came to me and talked to me. This took place at my hometown where I grew
up and I had been to this school for the next 4 years.

To my surprise one of the teachers asked my parents to leave me and told me to
attend the classes. I was not at all prepared to join the class but I found I
had little choice over that. My parents spent few times and advised me how to
behave, how to listen to teachers and many more tips. After my parents
abandoned me, I was frightened for few moments and sat at a corner of the
class. The teacher asked to come forward and introduce myself. I found I was
unable to walk and talk. But in few minutes my hesitation got away and I was
talking about myself.  
  
The teacher appreciated me and some of the new classmates came forward and
greeted me. I started enjoying the class and teachers and found that I started
loving my school. Later on I got admitted in college, university and many
other places but the memory of first day at primary school was totally
different and I still remember the day evidently.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

You are asked to talk about any event from your childhood which you still
remember. This event does not have to be a big event like a sporting success
or a visit to a famous place. You can talk about virtually anything that you
think was interesting and you can describe comfortably.  
  
Try to talk about something that you would be able to talk fluently. While in
the phase of 1-2 minutes for the cue card, many things from your childhood
might pop-up in your mind. But pick the thing that you would be able to talk
in details.  
  
Some of the common things that we usually remember from our childhood and this
list was made to help you generating some ideas to talk about:  
  
**1\. Your first day at school.  
2\. Your birthday celebration that you enjoyed.  
3\. A fight with a friend!  
4\. A brave thing you did as a child.  
5\. An expected gift that you got.  
6\. Something interesting you did.  
7\. Something naughty you did.  
8\. A dangerous experience from your childhood.**  
  
Not necessarily you have to talk about an interesting and enjoyable thing from
your childhood. You can talk about any negative experience you have had in
your childhood; like, a death of a relative could be a memorable event that
you can’t forget.  
  
Try to make the description interesting and give an impression that you are
reciting your memory. Being able to give much detail about the experience and

country&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a national festival in your country.

**You should say:**

  * When it takes place
  * Why it takes place
  * What the people do during this festival

**and explain why this festival is important to you.**

**Model answer:**  
New Year day is one of the most widely celebrated festivals in our country.
This is the occasion that people celebrates with great joy, hope, festivity
and different cultural and other programs.  
  
New Year is the time when a new calendar year begins and the year count is
incremented. According to Gregorian calendar, this festival falls on the first
January each year.  
People start the arrangement to celebrate this festival about one week prior
to the 1st January. On the 31st night, people gather together, eat western
foods and sometimes the traditional foods, make prayer for the prosperity of
for the New Year and stay awake till late night to enjoy the night.  
  
In my country, people groom well in the first January. To some extend people
believe that the first January is important to them as it the starting of a
new year. They believe that, remaining happy, eating good foods and wearing
nice clothes would make them happy and prosperous for the whole year.  
  
People greet others, give and receive gifts, visit the amusement parks and do
many other activities. Some fares held on for the occasion and a great
gathering is observed there.  So of the big trade fares, book fares starts on
the 1st day of the year.  
  
This is an important festival for us. We along with the whole world take this
day as an important festival day. In our tradition, we start the year with the
hope of eliminating the bitterness and failure of the past year and start a
fresh year with the hope of fortune and happiness.  


###  Tips for talking about this Cue Card Topic:

The national festival depends on your country and you must talk about a famous
national festival in your country. The festival can be historical and related
to the liberation war (_if it’s applicable for your country_) of your country,
can be major religious festival like Christmas, Puja, Eid, Vesak etc. Since
the cue card has not restricted you from talking about any nationally
celebrated festival like New Year or any other celebration day, you can talk
about those festivals as well.  
  
Pick the festival which is nationally and widely celebrated in your country
and take note on the questions asked with this cue card. Note the following
points:

  * The name of the festival.  


  * The historical/ religious/ cultural relevance and significance of the festival.  


  * The month or time when this festival is celebrated. Since the big national festival is celebrated once in a year, mention the exact date of the festival. Some festivals might lasts for more than a day and for such kind of festival give the idea of its length.  


  * Next mention the reason people in your country celebrates it. Mention the significance of this festival in details at this part and give some reasons why it is important for the people to celebrate this occasion.  


  * Now give details of the festival, how people prepare for this festival, what special items they prepare and what they do. Add some of your own activities at the end of this part.  


  * To answer the final question ‘why this festival is important to you’, you should remind that the historical/ religious or cultural importance of this festival and also mention how deeply you enjoy this festival.

Keep in mind that, you should give enough information to the examiner so that
answers of the cue card questions are fully given and in addition, you answer
some relevant questions that might have popped up in the examiner’s mind.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 50 - Describe something healthy you enjoy doing

sample%2F660-ielts-cue-card-sample-45-describe-something-healthy-you-enjoy-
doing&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something healthy you enjoy doing.

**You should say:**

  * What you do
  * Where you do it
  * Who you do it with

**and explain why you think doing this is healthy.**

**Possible Answer:**  
I wake up early in the morning and then walk for an hour every day. After that
I swim in the nearby river for about 30 minutes and then I start my day.
Waking up very early and then doing the physical exercise is the healthy habit
I have developed from the early stage of my life.

I remember my father insisting us to wake up very early and then took us to
the nearby high school ground for exercise. Nowadays, I wake up from bed at
around 5:30 am and wear my exercise trousers and the pair of shoes. Then I
start walking along with the road that has passed beside the river. The fresh
air in the morning is very healthy for health. Sometimes I take my bicycle and
instead of walking, I ride my cycle. I started doing this early morning
exercise and swimming few years back but nowadays 2 of my friends and cousins
accompany me almost every day. They enjoy doing the exercise very much.

The morning is a time when the air and environment remain fresher than anytime
of the day. So breathing the fresh air, doing the exercises and finally
swimming in the fresh water is definitely a very healthy habit. A sound mind
lies on a sound body and this habit that I adopted is pretty helpful for
keeping a sound health and sound mind.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card Topic:

Exercise, visiting open and natural places, good food habit etc. are some of
the habits which are related to the health. Exercise can vary from going for
walking in the morning &amp; evening, running, swimming, cycling, playing
outdoor games, and going to gymnasium, doing yoga etc. You can talk about any
exercise habit that you have for this cue card as exercise is healthy habit.  
  
Again you can talk about your passion on visiting different places on your
vacation as travelling to open spaces gives you mental refreshment as well as
help keeping good health.  
  
Finally a good food habit is something positive we can have to maintain a good
health. You can talk about your habit of eating vegetable over fishes and
meats. Your habit of drinking fruit juice daily is also something health you
do. Gardening is a good habit which involved both the passion and physical
exercise and can be described as a healthy habit.  
  
Pick an idea related to exercise, good food habit or travelling and talk about
that particular topic.  
  
On the other hand, reading books, cooking, listening to music etc. are good
for our mental health and thus keeps us joyful which is a healthy habit. If
you want to talk about your habit of listening music, painting, cooking or
reading, first mention the mental benefits it offers. Then relate the mental
health with the physical health and then continue describing the habit.  
  
The second question: "why you do it" and the fourth question "and explain why
you think doing this is healthy" are actually similar. For the later one
describe the benefits it offer and for the second question mention that  you
have a passion on doing it, you spend a quality time this way and you really
enjoy doing it. Since the cue card asks you to describe something healthy you
enjoy doing, do not only mention the health benefit it offers. You should also
talk about why you enjoy it, how passionate you feel about doing it and your
involvement on the task.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

Q. What sports do you play?

Q. What is the most popular sport in your country?

Q. What is the most popular form of exercise in your country?

Q. Do you think people in your country are less healthy than they used to be?

Q. How can we encourage young people to stay healthy?

Q. Should governments intervene to force people to be healthier?

  
  
**Your preparation for this cue card would also help you answering the following cue card topics:**  
  
**1\. Describe something you enjoy doing.  
2\. Describe something you do every day.  
3\. Describe a habit you have.  
4\. Describe an outdoor activity you have.  
5\. Describe a game or sports you enjoy playing.  
6\. Describe a really good habit you have.  
7\. Describe something you maintain to keep a good health.  
8\. Talk about something you often do.  
9\. Describe a place you often go to.  
10\. Describe something healthy you would recommend your friends.  
11\. Describe a healthy food item you eat.**

sample%2F668-ielts-cue-card-sample-58-describe-a-traditional-
meal&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a traditional meal that you prepare in your country on special
occasions.

**You should say:**

  * When you eat that meal
  * How you prepare it
  * What ingredients are used to prepare it

**and explain why you enjoy it.**

**Model answer:**  
Tandoori chicken with paratha is a traditional mean that we prepare in our
country on many different occasions. This is a famous meal in our country and
people can have them from some restaurants but they prepare this meal during
festivals at home.  
  
Tandoori chicken is originally Punjabi dish that we adopted and this dish
consists of roasted chicken with spices, testing salt and yogurt. This meal is
usually prepared in a cylindrical clay oven, a tandoor, in which this dish is
usually prepared. The city people usually buy this special oven which is made
of steel or metal but in village, people make the oven with mud and wood.  
  
The paratha is a special kind of baked bread. Usually the paratha is made from
wheat flat breads and then dough with cooking oil or ghee. We have this meal
almost in all occasions. Not necessarily this is the only meal we prepare in
our festivals but this is a very common meal along with other traditional
meals. People love to have this meal in festivals and it seems like they
usually assume that this is something they must prepare for the guests. In the
different parts of the country, this meal get some other variation in terms of
cooking process, presentation and ingredients, but they are almost same in all
part and the custom of making it in festival is quite common.  
  
From my childhood I have always found this meal delicious and very common
during festivals. So phycologically and in terms of its great taste, I love to
eat this meal. Our people have good hand on preparing delicious meals and as a
traditional meal we enjoy it very much. For me, I don't have the chance to eat
this meal always as I live in a city far away from our hometown. So during the
festival when I stay at my hometown, I really enjoy a known meal which is
delicious and traditional to us.

###  Tips for answering this Cue card topic:

First important thing about his cue card is that, you should talk about a
special menu/ dishes/ food item/ meal you prepare on a special day (festival
day) in your country. By ‘you’ the cue card does not mean that you prepare it
yourself, but the people in your country mostly prepare the meal for the
special occasion. The special occasion can be a national day like liberation
day, a widely celebrated cultural day like New Year day, can be a religiously
sacred day like Eid, Puja, Christmas etc. You should pick an occasion and
think about a meal you are familiar with. Since you need to describe the
occasion, the significance of this occasion, the meal itself, the ingredients
to prepare this meal, the tradition of preparing this meal and why this meal
is a part of the occasion. Though you need to give some details of the
occasion, its significance in your culture and country, you have to emphasize
on the meal itself as the cue card topic is about the traditional meal but not
on the occasion.  
  
For the first question, ‘When you eat that meal’, describe if this is a
traditional meal that you prepare on that special day or on some other days of
the year as well. For example, some cakes and food items are particularly
prepared on special occasion like New Year and other seasonal occasions but
people eat it in other days as well. Give the background of the food relating
it to your tradition. For instance, in some Asian countries, preparing cakes
in winter season in traditional.  
  
For the second and third questions “How you prepare it” and “What ingredients
are used to prepare it” you should talk about the ingredients required and the
processes involved to prepare it. Be very careful about describing the process
as this is the most interesting part of the topic. The examiner might be
interested to learn a new meal which is specially and differently prepared in
your country. So being able to give a good description about the preparation
of this meal would give a good impression to the examiner. Failing to do so
might give a negative impression that your speaking is not as on the topic as
it supposed to be.  
  
Finally, give your own reason why you enjoy this meal. To answer this final
question, say that this is a really delicious food and this is prepared for
the special occasion only. Relate the tradition of this food in your country
and culture and also mention that how people of your country love to eat that
meal. You should also mention that you remember having this meal on that
special occasion from your childhood and that had become your way of
celebrating the occasion. Mention how this occasion and meal you prepare in
your country are related to your tradition and celebration and conclude your
speaking with that.  
Being able to answer the questions listed below the cue card topic correctly
and convincingly would ensure a good score in your speaking section of the
IELTS exam.

If you can answer this cue card topic, you should also be to answer the
following cue card topics:

**1.    Describe a traditional food item in your country.  
2.    Describe a meal you know how to prepare.  
3.    Describe a national festival in your country.  
4.    Describe a meal you enjoy eating.  
5.    Describe a widely celebrated occasion in your country.  
6.    Describe an occasion that you celebrated recently.**

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 41 - Describe your holidays

sample%2F624-ielts-cue-card-sample-41-describe-your-
holidays&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your holidays.

**You should say:**

  * Where you go for the holidays
  * how long they last
  * Who you go with

**and talk about any thing interesting happens during your holidays.**

**Follow-up Questions:**  
  
    What do the Indian people mostly do in their leisure time?  
    What's the difference between holidays today and 5 years ago and the
reasons for the change?  
    Do you think people will spend more time on leisure or working in the
future?

**Model Answer 1:**  
In most of my holidays I go to visit my family members in my hometown. For my
job, I am currently residing in the capital city of my country but my parents,
siblings, grandparents, uncle and aunts are living in our hometown. So in most
of my holidays I go to visit my family members. My typical holidays last for
4-5 days most of the time and sometimes I get longer holidays.  
  
When I was a university student, I had some friends studying in the same
faculty who were from my hometown. During my university study we used to go to
our hometown together on our vacations but now-a-days I go to my hometown
mostly alone. The journey takes about 6-7 hours by bus. Sometimes we travel by
train and this train journeys usually take 8-9 hours including the stoppage.
Though the journey is tiresome sometimes, but the thought of meeting my family
members and the excitement of being in the place I really love wash away the
tiresomeness and monotonous feeling of the journey.  
  
The time I stay with my family members and local friends, I enjoy the moments
very much. This is the town where I grew up and naturally all of my childhood
&amp; adolescence memories are related to this place. I do lots of interesting
things there during my holidays: I swim in the river, take care of the garden
and firm we have, collect vegetables and fruits from our garden and then make
arrangement to sell those to the local sellers, sometime I catch fished, play
with my friends both indoor and outdoor games, visit different places and do
lots of other stuffs.  
  
In my city life, I have to follow a strict timeline and stay at office most of
the time, but in my hometown where I mostly go during my holidays, I am quite
free and do whatever I feel like doing and spend time with the people I care
most. That's why I prefer to go to my hometown during my holidays rather than
going to other places.

**Model Answer 2:**  
Thank you for the opportunity to talk about my holidays and I would like to
talk it in details.  I prefer to enjoy my holidays only in beautiful Kerala
which is my favourite place with natural beauty.

If I go for holidays, I spend at least one week in this area. Since I am quite
busy person with my work, this is the only time for me to interact with my
family members. So I always want to spend these days only with my family
members.

Last year, I went for a holiday for two weeks which was very interesting
because we cooked food for ourselves on the road side and we also found some
suitable places for having food. It was the first experience of such kind for
me and I will never forget it. I am not good at cooking. But on those days I
made different foods which were a whole new experience for me as well as for
my family members. Actually we planned to buy foods from some restaurants.
However, it did not work due to some reasons. Firstly, I felt very sad because
of inconvenience. But later we managed very well and we enjoyed a lot. Still I
cherish each and every moment with my relatives.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

Since you are free to talk about multiple activities that you usually do in
your holidays, you can talk about many of them and this makes this cue card an
easy one. You don't have to talk about a single activity that you mostly do in
your holidays unless you really confident that you would be able to give a lot
of details of this single activity.

  
Take some notes on the activities you do in your holidays and then start
talking about these activities. They can be both the indoor and outdoor
activities as the topic has not specified any of them.

  
Though the holidays are specifically the days set aside by custom or law on
which people keep away the formal daily office or business works and
celebrates an event or tradition of religious or cultural significance, you
are not bound to describe a major festivals as your holidays. In some parts of
the world holidays are treated as vacations and you can talk about your
vacations as well. If you want you can also describe your activities on major
festivals or religiously significant days.

  

Some of the common things people do on their holidays:

  * They put aside the office or business tasks and spend time with family members and friends. 
  * They cook and prepare some special dishes at home or go to outside to visit famous places. 
  * They go to their hometown and spend towns there. 
  * They do some shopping as part of the holidays. 
  * Some people go to visit other places or cities during their holidays. 
  * They maintain the social relations and visit neighbors and relatives on their holidays.
  * People obey the religious rituals and rules if this is a religious holiday. 

Your preparation for this cue card would help you answering the following cue
cards also:

**1\. Describe one of your holidays. **

**2\. Talk about a major festival in your country. **

**3\. Describe a typical day off you have. **

**4\. Describe your activity during a major festival. **

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 59 - Describe the most useful household appliance

appliance&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe the most useful household appliance that you have.

**You should say:**

  * What it is?
  * How it works?
  * How life would be without it?

**and explain why it is so important to you to you.**

**Model answer 1:**  
Lots of household appliances are really useful to have, but today I’m going to
tell you about the most useful appliance I have in my home.  I’ll tell you
what it is, how it works, and how life would be without it, and why it is so
important to me.

I didn’t have to think very long about which appliance to choose to talk about
for this topic, for me it is easy.  I picked the item I just could not live
without.  What is it?  It’s a kettle.  How it works?  Well, I fill it with
water from my tap – and I’m lucky, where I live in Yorkshire we have lovely
soft water that boils quickly and tastes great – then I simply replace the
kettle on its base, flick a switch and wait for the kettle to boil.   There is
an element within the kettle that gets hot from the electricity, and that’s
what heats the water, I don’t really know how to explain it any more fully…
We have a saying in our country ‘a watched kettle never boils’ I think that’s
true!  The more you impatiently watch a kettle waiting for it to come to the
boil the longer it seems to take.

The principle of a kettle is very simple, and it’s something that is easy to
take for granted, but life without a kettle for me is unthinkable.  I can
think of three main reasons and all are important to me!

Firstly, I have to start my day with a cup of strong tea,  I can’t do anything
or speak to anyone until I’ve had that first cuppa of the day.  I like
Yorkshire tea, made in a pot and served with unsweetened soya milk which I
always put in first.  I like the pot to stand for a bit before I pour, and the
tea has to be made with water that has literally just boiled or it really
doesn’t taste the same.  I also ideally like to have my tea in my favourite
mug – never a cup.  So without a kettle, I just couldn’t face my day!

The second reason is because in my country, if anyone ever visits your house,
whether that is a friend or a tradesperson come to do a job for you, the first
thing you do to be polite and welcoming is offer a drink of either tea or
coffee.  Without a kettle to hand that little ritual would be impossible, it
would feel so wrong.

Thirdly, and possibly most importantly of all, there is nothing as bonding as
sitting down with a hot cup of tea with a  friend and talking to put the world
to rights.  Biscuits welcome too, but tea will suffice.  It is my firm belief
that no problem is so great it cannot be resolved with – or at least
diminished by -- a shared pot of tea.

If you think I am placing too much importance on a kettle you are wrong!  I
don’t have to imagine life without a kettle, as unfortunately I have
experienced it.  One day I went to put my kettle on and it immediately fused,
it wouldn’t work!  Even though it was early in the morning it was unthinkable
to go to my job without having had my cup of tea first.  Before I did anything
else, I hauled some trousers and a top on over my pyjamas and headed to a 24
hour supermarket so I could buy a cheap kettle, return home and have my cup of
tea as usual before my shower and dressing for work.  That might sound
extreme, but for me it was the only sensible practical option.  When we have
an occasional power cut in the UK, it’s horrendous.  I can manage without
electric light or hot water, but no kettle? That’s really challenging!

A kettle is a much overlooked household appliance, but in my experience it is
the most important one.  Tea starts the day, shows hospitality, and I my
culture is the one sure fire way to make everything better.  A sit down and a
cup of tea (or coffee) with a close friend is one of the best stress busters
in the world, and without a kettle, it would be much much harder to deliver on
demand!

**Model answer 2:**  
I consider the refrigerator to be the most useful household appliance I have.
Among other household appliances I would put refrigerator ahead because of its
usefulness specifically for me. I live in an apartment and mostly maintain all
of my tasks by myself. I can't think of living without the refrigerator I do
have.  
  
I own a refrigerator manufactured by LG and it is a side-by side refrigerator
with an icemaker. I put most of the foods, water and cooked food there. It
makes my life easier and helps me eat fresh foods. It is quite tough for me to
cook 2-3 times a day and the refrigerator saves me from doing so. My
refrigerator consists of a thermally insulated compartment and the heat pump
that transfers the heat created inside to the external environment. As a
result the inside of the refrigerator remains cool to a temperature below the
room temperature. There is a temperature controller that the user can use to
maintain the desired temperature. This temperature can differ based on the
room temperature and the type of food preserved. The refrigerator also reduce
the rate of spoilage of foods and foods item by maintaining a lower
temperature which helps keep lower the reproduction of bacteria to a minimal
level.  
  
Without the refrigerator life would have been much difficult. I would have to
go to shop every now and then and buy only minimum amount of fruits,
vegetables and other food items that I would be able to eat in a day.  
  
I would have to purchase cold water in summer season and have to cook 3 times
a day. That would have killed a significant amount of time and would not allow
me to do other stuffs that I currently do. Making ice cream, smoothie and
other juices would have been quite impossible and my lifestyle would not
permit me to eat fresh fruits and foods. Sometimes I bring foods, meats and
vegetables from my hometown and preserve them for more than a month. That
would have been impossible without the refrigerator I own.  
  
For all those reasons, the refrigerator has become an important appliance for
my daily life.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

Some of the useful household appliances that you can talk about for this cue
card topic:  
  
**•    Toaster  
•    Stereo  
•    Vacuum Cleaner  
•    Heating Machine  
•    Refrigerator  
•    Rice Cook  
•    Floor Cleaner  
•    Microwave woven  
•    Coffee maker  
•    TV  
•    Radio  
•    Iron machine  
•    Washing Machine** Etc.  
  
Pick the household appliance that you often use and choosing such an appliance
would help you describing it in details. This cue card asks you to describe
how this tool works and hence picking up a less complicated tool in terms of
its mechanical functionality (Iron machine or radio for example) would be a
good idea rather than picking up a more complicated appliance like
refrigerator.  
  
To describe how this tool works, you do not have to describe the mechanical
aspects of this tool; rather you can describe how you see it. For example:
while describing a refrigerator, you can give mechanical and electrical
aspects of this appliance but if you are not sure about these aspects simply
say that you put the food items and liquid items inside the refrigerator and
it maintain a temperature to keep them fresh. Also mention that you can adjust
the temperature and this gives you more control over the cooling process.
Obviously if you can give some details from the mechanical perspective of such
tolls, that you be better but always keep in mind that, too much mechanical
description might not interest your examiner.  
  
To answer properly, first say the name of the household appliance with the
brand name and for how long you have it. Now give the functional aspects of
this appliance, i.e. how it works and you should also mention how you use this
tool in your home. Then go to more details of the importance of this tool for
you and describe how tough it would have been if you have done things manually
without this tools. Take washing machine for example, and you know without it
you would have to wash all your clothes manually that would have been really
time consuming and cumbersome. Say that because of this tool you can very
easily engage in other important tasks and the washing machine takes care of
your laundry.  
  
Say some experiences you have before you purchased this machine and that would
be good to describe the part ‘How life would be without it’. The final part of
the cue card is ‘and explain why it is so important to you” and in this part
you have to emphasize some of the points you have already told earlier
regarding the question ‘How life would have been without it”.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

Q. What kinds of machines are used for housework in modern homes in your
country?

Q. How have these machines benefited people? Are there any negative effects of
using them?

Q. Do you think all new homes will be equipped with household machines in the
future? Why?

Q. What kinds of equipment do most workers need to use in offices today?

Q. How have developments in technology affected employment in your country?

Q. Some people think that technology has brought more stress than benefits to
employed people nowadays. Would you agree or disagree? Why?

**Some similar cue card topics:**  
  
**1.    Describe something you own which is important to you.  
2.    Describe an electronic equipment you own.  
3.    Describe a tool that you often use.  
4.    Describe a gift you recently got.  
5.    Describe a tool you plan to buy.  
6.    Describe a useful household appliance.  **

from-a-member-of-your-family&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something useful you learned from a member of your family.

**You Should Say:**

  * What you learned.
  * How this became useful later in your life
  * Have you taught it to someone

**and exlain why it was important for you. **

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * Why should we learn from others?
  * What are the importances of having friends?

**Model Answer:**  
I have been grown-up in a joint family with more than 12 family members. They
were my parents, siblings, grandma, grandpa, uncle, aunt and cousins. I had
the chance to learn so many things from them and it is in fact natural that a
kid would learn things from his/her family members. I have learned swimming
from my uncle, learned paining from my aunt, learned to play chess from my
grandpa, learned to play cricket and badminton from my brother and so on and
on. I have learned how to handle the stress and adverse time from my parents
and learned how to behave with unknown people from my elder cousin. Thus the
list would be a very long one. But I would like to emphasize the thing that I
learned from my younger aunt and that is the reading habit and the pleasure of
reading. Not that other things I learned from other family members are of less
importance, but the reading for please and true interest of reading that I
learned from my aunt is different and have a great power.  
  
I found my aunt very charming, caring and possesses a great personality. She
had been a voracious reader and because of that she was more learned and wise
than people of her age. Initially I thought that how come she spend most of
her time reading? Over the time I became close to her, and she started helping
me with my studies. She started inspiring me to read books other than my
academic books. She read me stories and that help me grow an interest towards
books. Then she started telling me amazing stories of our history and showed
me which books actually have those histories written.  
  
She shared the stories she were reading and thus we started becoming good
critic of stories and writers. She told me more stories that I have heard from
anyone else. I am grateful to her that she so painstakingly explained
different topics and help me grow a good interest on reading. Because of her
contribution I have started reading books of different types whenever I got
time which I think is a better investment and activity than spending time
idly.  
  
Later I have inspired my nephew to read book. I did the same; I read him
stories which would be interesting to him and gave him sweets, candies, ice-
cream if he could have finished a book and explain the stories. I guess he has
become interested in reading as well.

###  Tips for Answering this Cue card Question:

You can talk about anything you learned from one of your family members. It
can be a morality like and a good quality like: honesty, truthfulness,
capability of being strong in the time of distress, bravery, ability to
protest again bad things, well manner etc. If you talk about such a morality
or good quality, emphasize the person from whom you learned this. Give one or
two example when you find this family member has shown this quality and you
were impressed. Also mention some of the events when this morality or good
quality that you learned became very useful for you.  
  
For the question “Have you taught it to someone later”, you should not
directly say you have taught it to someone as those moralities and good
quality can’t be directly taught to someone. Rather you should say that, one
of your friends, neighbors, younger family members has been influenced by this
quality and you later found that s/he has also acquired this morality/ good
quality.  
  
Again, you can talk about a practical skill you learned from one of your
family members like: cooking, electric work, wood work, computer, singing,
dancing, handicraft, driving, playing a musical instrument etc. Describing
such a practical skill would be comparatively easy as you would be very easily
answer the questions of the cue cards.  
  
If you can answer this cue card, you should also be able to answer the
following cue cards:  
  
**1.  Describe something you learned from others.  
2.  Describe a practical skill you have.  
3.  Describe a good quality you admire.  
4.  Describe something learn worthy from your one of your family members.  
5.  Describe a quality or skill you have.  
6.  Describe a skill you taught to someone.  
7.  Describe a good quality you admire in your friends.  
8.  Describe a family member you really admire.**

sample%2F665-ielts-cue-card-sample-55-describe-an-interesting-holiday-
destination&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an interesting holiday destination.

**You should say:**

  * what the place is?
  * what you can see and do there?
  * what time of the year it is better to be there?

**and explain why you like it.**

**Model Answer:**  
Dartmoor National Park in the South West of England is a really interesting
holiday destination. I went there couple of years ago with my friends and
really enjoyed our visit there. This park is a beautiful place with around 368
square miles with magnificent wildlife, wooden valley, ancient ruins and
beautiful moorland. This is a popular and interesting destination for a wide
range of tourists.  
  
This are consist about 33,000 population which swells mostly during the pick
period of tourists coming there. There are lots to see and observe in this
area even the military training. Sanding stone, which is really rare in other
areas can be found there. If you like history, this place would offer you a
lot. Walk around the moor and you will find stone circles, stone across the
villages. United Kingdom's largest collection of Bronze Age structure and
several other stone tors are scattered across this area.  
  
The wild life, incredible landscape, wide moorland is a perfect place to
explore and get active. The apex point on Dartmoor is on the northern moor
which is a great place to be.  
The rivers shaping the landscape is another attraction and to get involved in
tourists activity like swimming, catching fishes and to make camp beside.  
  
This is not like other typical tourist destinations where you can either see
the scenic beauty or go for surfing. This place offers you all. Get there,
enjoy the scenic beauty, villages, wild lives, history, military activity,
rivers, camp there, stay there, ride there and make all of these activities to
refresh yourself and this place is bound to attract you to revisit.  
  
There is no strict time to go there. People visit this place almost around the
year. But it is advisable to avoid the snow, rain and extreme cold season.
Other than that, you are free to come and visit the place whenever you want.

###  Tips for Answering this Cue Card Sample:

This cue card expects the candidate to talk about a holiday destination (_a
place where people visit and spend their time during their holidays / more
specifically tourist spots_). Since this topic asks you to talk about an
interesting holiday destination, you should mention about a place which offers
different interesting activities and have things of interest to observe.

You can mention either a holiday destination in your own country (_even in
your own town/ city_) or a place which is in a foreign country. Though the
topic does not ask to talk about a holiday destination that you have visited,
but the questions below the topic somehow relate to your experience about the
holiday destination. So try to talk about a tourist spot you know about and if
this is a place you have visited would be better.

If the holiday destination is interesting or not would mainly depend on your
description. With a good description you can make an ordinary place to be very
interesting. So to answer this cue card, pick a place where people usually go
to spend their holidays. Talk about things that people do there, what are the
things people do there etc. Then add your own experience what you did their
and how you found it interesting.  
Some of the ideas to describe an interesting holiday destination:  
  
1\. An amusement park.  
2\. A picnic spot.  
3\. A beach.  
4\. A mega shopping mall.  
5\. A famous historical place.  
6\. A big park or a place near open space.  
7\. A historical place.  
8\. A theatre. Etc.  
  
All of the above mentioned place can be an interesting holiday destination.
You can pick one of those places and mention that lots of people visit this
place in their holidays. Then mention how far it is and how to reach their.
Then give some details of this place and the type of people who often visit
there.  
  
**Your ability to answer this cue card would help you answer the following cue cards:**  
  
**1\. Talk about a place worth visiting.  
2\. Describe a place where a lot of tourists visit.  
3\. Describe a famous tourist destination in your country.  
4\. Describe a place near lots of water or open space.  
5\. Talk about a place where you spent your holiday.

give-your-opinion&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a time when you were asked to give your opinion in a
questionnaire or survey.

**You should say:**

  * what the questionnaire/survey was about
  * why you were asked to give your opinions
  * what opinions you gave

**and explain how you felt about giving your opinions in this questionnaire/ survey.**

**Follow Up Questions:**

  * What kinds of organisation want to find out about people’s opinions?
  * Do you think that questionnaires or surveys are good ways of finding out people’s opinions?
  * What reasons might people have for not wanting to give their opinions?
  * Do you think it would be a good idea for schools to ask students their opinions about lessons?
  * What would the advantages for schools be if they asked students their opinions?
  * Would there be any disadvantages in asking students’ opinions?

**Sample Answer:**  
The survey I recall very clearly that I participated was the one conducted in
our university. I was a student of 7th semester then and I actively
participated in University debate team. Our team did well in different
contents and then our university administration took this seriously. As part
of their initiatives, they conducted a survey to gather information what can
be done to make the team even better. As far as I recall, it was Friday
evening and after reaching the 6th floor of our university debate team room, I
heard that we will have a session in the auditorium. We left the room and went
to the auditorium. I was amazed to notice some of the high level
administrative officials in the hall and then learned that they would be
discussing about the debate team we have.  
  
They congratulated us and promised that they would help the team and the
association every way possible so that we can practice and do even better in
the future. As part of the discussion, the debate team members, trainers and
associated members were asked to take part in a survey. After I got the survey
papers and pen, I found that that was a questionnaire of 2 pages and there
were approximately 20 questions there. Most of the questions were multiple
choices but there were 5-6 questions that asked to write our comments or
thoughts. The topic of the survey was (as far as remember): "How initiatives
can be taken and what improvements can be done to make our university debate
team even better". As a debate team member and active debater I was naturally
asked to participate in the survey to express my opinion.  
  
I mostly expresses what should be done to make the debate team a good one,
appreciated the university authority's so far help and specifically mentioned
what are the difficulties we have faced and what are the steps that should be
taken to eradicate this issues. I was excited that the upper administration
was taking notice on our debate team and when they conducted the survey, I
felt really good and kind of honored to be the part of the team. I have been
involved in the debate team for about 2 years and with very little help from
the university fund and administration we started doing better and after the
session and survey I felt it was worthy to be the part of the extra curriculum
activities.  
  
The overall experience was good and that's why I still remember this survey;
even after I took part many different marketing and online surveys, this one
was special to me.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card Question:

People are usually asked to give opinion in a questionnaire or survey when
they are a part of a team and the authority feels that the team members
opinion are needed to bring some changes. Also a marketing executive or
marketing representative can ask you to volunteer in their survey to give your
opinion on their products or survey. The government runs some survey among
people to know the overall opinion of the countrymen. Sometimes you would be
asked to give your opinion by a radio, television channel about an issue or on
their program quality. You should be able to talk about one such survey or
questionnaire you were asked or requested to take part. The questionnaire can
be both in written and verbal form.

For this cue card first say a survey you have taken part and mention when it
was, what was the survey, who conducted it and whether you have given written
answer to the questionnaire or verbally. Some surveys ask people to give
survey takers identity while some conduct it anonymously. Mention what type of
survey you took.  
  
You should try to talk about a survey that has some value like a survey
conducted by the local authority to make the area a better place rather than
the random marketing surveys.  
  
For the second question "why you were asked to give your opinions" say the
reason the survey conductor asked you to participate it. If it was a marketing
survey say that you were randomly picked. If this is a survey conducted by the
local administration, say they conducted the survey among the local people and
you were one of them. Being a part of a team sometimes may require you to take
part of the survey and if you talk about such a survey, mention that you were
asked to take part of this survey because of your involvement in the team.  
  
For the question "what opinions you gave", you do not need to talk about the
questions asked in the survey and the exact answers you gave. Try to give an
overview of the things which were asked and a summary of the opinion and
answer you gave.  
  
If the survey was an important one for the team authority, mention that you
felt really proud to be able to let the authority know your thinking. If this
was a marketing survey, mention that you felt well to let them know your idea
about their products or services. If this was your first survey mention that
you were very excited to be able to gain a new experience as you have never
taken part in such a survey. Give some reason why the survey was important and
finally say that it was important for you to give your thinking and you felt
really good for being able to do so.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What kinds of organisation want to find out about people’s opinions?  
Q. Do you think that questionnaires or surveys are good ways of finding out
people’s opinions?  
Q. What reasons might people have for not wanting to give their opinions?  
Q. Do you think it would be a good idea for schools to ask students their
opinions about lessons?  
Q. What would the advantages for schools be if they asked students their
opinions?  
Q. Would there be any disadvantages in asking students’ opinions?



**If you can answer this cue card topic, you should be able to answer the following cue card topics as well: **  


**1. Talk about something interesting you did recently. **

**2. Describe an interesting experience of your life. **

**3. Describe something unusual you did recently. **

**4. Describe your experience of a survey you took part in. **

  * Can you tell about some recreational spots that are absent in your country but are common in other countries?
  * What are the most recreational places in your country?

**Sample Answer 1: **  
Picnics are a great way to get outside and socialise with friends.  I’m lucky,
because there are lots of good places near me where people can relax, play,
chat and have a picnic if they wish.  I can think of one favourite place.
I’ll tell you where it is and what it’s like and try and make you understand
why it is so appealing to me and lots of other visitors too.  I actually think
the place has quite an important role in our local community, and maybe you
will understand why after my little talk.

The place is Endcliffe Park in Sheffield.  It is a city park, by which I mean
it is close to urban areas, surrounded by residential streets and local shops.
However the park itself is lovely.  It is quite big, about 37 acres, big
enough to have streams running through it, patches of woodland, a duck pond,
mown areas where people can play ball games and plenty of benches where you
can sit and watch the world go by.  It’s well maintained by the local council,
and has other facilities – including loos and a very nice independent café.
In the summer months there is often an ice-cream van parked up, and at
weekends and bank holidays a local guy puts up a bouncy castle and a miniature
children’s carousel for children to play on.  There is a small playground with
swings and climbing frames, and recently, the council even incorporated a new
parkour area.  This is a special structure of climbing frames and walls where
people can practise the sport of free running in urban areas.  It is
incredible to watch.

I love this park, because it is really well used.  I’m a great one for people
watching.  You can head down there with a sandwich, find yourself a bench and
sit and watch the world go by.  There are always families out feeding the
ducks;children on their bikes or scooters; joggers sprinting by; dog-walkers.
Sometimes you will see a school party pond-dipping or bravely crossing one of
the sets of stepping stones.  Often photographers will set up elaborate
tripods there to try and get photos of the wildlife – there are lots of
squirrels and birds, including a dramatic heron (a large stork like bird)
which fishes in the pond, or the colourful tiny kingfishers that favour the
running water of the streams.  Local fitness instructors run outdoor boot-
camps there, so you will see puffing people doing press-ups and looking like
they’ve rather regretted signing up for their exercise class that morning!  I
think you can see why I like it so much and appreciate all the many
attractions that are there for visitors of all ages and backgrounds to enjoy.

In terms of how the spot influences people, I think it just really brings the
community together.  Everyone who lives locally uses it.  If ever I go out for
a walk there, as I do quite often, I will always bump into someone I know.
People use the café as a base for setting up community campaigns – like saving
local trees, or fundraising for charities.  It is also a great location for
many local events, particularly running ones.  Endcliffe Park hosts my local
Parkrun (a 5km weekly jog each Saturday morning) as well as being the start of
lots of off-road running races that are held throughout the year.  Because it
is a big open space, it even hosts funfairs, music festivals and circuses – I
don’t really like circuses to be honest, but it illustrates the point of how
well-used the space is as a venue.  On a daily basis people use the park as a
short cut to get to work in the city.  It is great to be able to appreciate
the trees and changing seasons on a walk to go to the shops or get to the
office.   This park is one of many that fall within the city boundaries.  It
is one of the reasons that Sheffield is known as the greenest city in the UK.
You should come and visit and find out for yourself.

There are other more remote places you can go to enjoy the countryside and be
alone in the heather and the hills. Those are beautiful destinations too. But
for me, my local park is just brilliant, it’s practically on my doorstep and a
window on the world.  I am so lucky to have this picnic and recreation spot
nearby, I try never to take it for granted, but always take the time to really
look at what surrounds me when I pass through.

**Model answer 2:**  
I come from Kuala Lumpur and one of the great picnic spots or recreational
places there is Taman Lembah Kiara. This place is located in Taman Tun Dr
Islamia in Kuala Lumpur. This is a very popular recreational place spot for
nearby residents and sometimes tourists come to visit the place as well.  
  
In the morning the Joggers come to start their day with the exercises in the
fresh air. This is a place with scenic beauty, fresh air, comfortable weather
and everybody loves the well-paved walking path. The park also offers a shady
place for picnic lovers under the shade and they can stay there for long and
enjoy their picnic. You can see that the forest animals like monkey roam there
freely and some birds will attract your attention. People mostly like this
place for the scenic beauty and comfortable weather. You will have plenty of
opportunity to enjoy your relaxed time there. The morning joggers are mainly
the regular goers there but the nearby residents walk in the evening as well.
This is a great place to relax and for recreation.

This is different than the busy metro life and people can enjoy the beautiful
green surroundings without interruption and disturbance.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card topic:

This cue card asks you to talk about a picnic spot or a recreational public
place that you have been to and liked. Please note that, the picnic spot can
be any place where people can gather, enjoy and have their meals. This can be
a historical place where picnic is allowed, a place near a sea, river, forest,
lake where people usually go to have a picnic. This can be a private place
which is a rented for the picnic and can also be a garden where people like to
spent time.  
  
On the other hand the recreational place which comes as an alternative place
of the picnic spot can be a place where people go to relax or walk; example a
park, garden, river sil6de etc. Other public recreational place can be a
theater, cinema, park, amusement park etc. You can talk about any of the above
mentioned place for this cue card.  
For the first question give the city name, then the nearby landmarks and
easily spot able location of the picnic spot or recreational place you would
like to talk about. You can actually talk about the location of a place either
by taking about how to reach there from the bust stop of the city or by the
nearby famous land marks.  
  
For the second question “What are the attractive things for the visitors
there” talk about the place and what are the main attractions of this place.
Some of the common attraction of a natural picnic spot which might help you to
generate ides:  
  
1.    Large and full of natural beauty.  
2.    Open and there are lots of places for playing  
3.    Near water and a soft wind blows all the time.  
4.    Not that much crowded and it was a scenic beauty.  
5.    There was clean water and we swam there.  
6.    We saw lots of birds, flowers, natural animals and wild animals.  
7.    That was a historically famous place.  
8.    The museum in that place had a good collection of cultural icons.  
9.    Hill was nearby etc.  
  
For the third question “why you liked it” pick some of the activities you had
there and also mention some of the attractive things you did there. Following
are some of the ideas to help you generate your own ideas:  
  
1.    I was with my friends/ family members and I enjoyed a lot being with
them.  
2.    The place was bit different from the place I live.  
3.    I was a really attractive place at it had a great natural view.  
4.    I swam in the water, caught fishes, played football and ran for a while.  
5.    I enjoyed everything I did there and those activities reminded me my
childhood.  
6.    I had a busy deadline and after that the picnic was very refreshing.  
7.    The vacation along with the picnic arrangement was a much needed
vacation for me.  
8.    I loved the place and the meal I had there.  
9.    I participated in the competition of play/ game/ acting/ singing and
that was a long since I last time did it.  
  
**You should mention three points to make the answer of your third question strong:**  
That was a very beautiful place. You enjoyed the activities and companies
there. The activity and the place were very refreshing for you. For the final
question ‘Why people like it and who are the regular visitor there”, talk some
points mentioned above and then say that local and international tourists are
the regular visitor there. To make your statement stronger say that, you have
gone there several times and found many foreigners and local people who came
to have a really good time and picnic there. Also mention that, you read some
articles about this place and you did some Googling before coming here.
Mentioning those points would make your last statement “i.e. international and
local tourists visit that place” stronger.  
  
**Some very similar cue cards:**  
  
**1.    Describe a worth visiting place in your town/ city.  
2.    Describe a place worth visiting.  
3.    Describe a recreational place you recently went to.  
4.    Describe an interesting thing you did lately.  
5.    Describe a place you recently visited.**

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a game or sport you enjoy playing.

You should say:

  * What kind of game or sports it is
  * Who you play it with
  * Where you play it

**and explain why you enjoy playing it.**

**Possible Answer:  
**I've played several games, both indoor and outdoor games, and still try to play whenever I get time. Among those games, I enjoyed playing chess more than others. Chess is an indoor game where two players participate. This game does not involve any major physical movements like other outdoor games but a chess player has to use his/her brain and make game plans to defeat the opponent.  
  
I mostly play this game with my friends and cousins. Sometimes I play it with
my father and senior relatives. Since playing chess requires only placing the
board on a surface and sitting position of the two participating players, it
is convenient to play chess almost anywhere. I mostly play it at our veranda,
garden or bed room. I enjoy this game because I have a fascination about this
game from my childhood and I really like the overall theme and barnstorming
involved in this game. It's a thought provoking game that gives the
participating players to use their brains. A player can apply his/her
strategy, and then allure the opponent to fall in trap which is much like a
real battle field.  
  
It's not a game where someone would only use the physical movements rather the
game requires perfect game plan, finding weakness of the opponent and a battle
strategy. This game gives you a feel of being the King of a regime where you
decide your country men's fate. For all those reasons this is a very
interesting and enjoyable game to me.

###  ﻿  
Tips for answering this Cue Card Topic:

Since the cue card is about your favourite game or sports, you can talk about
any indoor or outdoor game or sport you you play or know about. Alternatively
you can talk about the computer games as well. If this is an indoor game you
want to talk about  pick chess, card, table tennis, bowling, karom, computer
game, gaming device game or any other game you prefer. For the indoor games
you can mention that you regularly play it with your family members or friends
and enjoy it a lot. Generally physical exercise is not involved in indoor
games except table tennis and you should focus on the mental improvement and
enjoyment the indoor games offer. Indoor games are usually played inside homes
and you should mention that you play it in your house, veranda, drawing room
or in guest room. You should also mention that you play it in your relatives'
houses or friends' houses as well.  
  
If you pick an outdoor games like cricket, football, badminton, rugby you
should mention that you play it with your friends and some of the neibours.
Sometimes unknown people join in such games where more than 7-8 players are
needed. Mention that these games are refreshing and a good way of keeping your
health fit.  
  
For the question why do you enjoy playing this game, you should mention that
you have a great passion about this game or sport and you have been playing it
for a long time. You can also mention that you are usually good at it and your
percentage of winning the game is very good. If you talk about indoor game,
mention the excitement and brainstorming it offers and the way you enjoy
playing it with your family members and friends. For the outdoor games mention
the health benefits it offer and the way you enjoy playing it.  
  
The follow-up question of this cue card might ask you the most common types of
games and sports played in your country so you should prepare for that as
well.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What types of sports are popular in your country?

Q. What are the benefits of playing a sport?

Q. How can sports bring people from different countries closer together?

Q. What are the advantages of hosting different international sporting events
in a country?

Q. How can we encourage children to participate in different types of sporting
activities?  
  
**Being able to answer this question would help you answering the following cue card topics also:**  
  
**1\. Talk about something you enjoy doing at home.  
2\. Describe something you do often.  
3\. Talk about an outdoor activity you have.  
4\. Describe a healthy habit you have.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 53 - Describe a worth watching theatrical
performance

performance&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a worth watching theatrical performance.

**You should say:**

  * What the play was about
  * Where it took place
  * How was the acting and quality of the production

**and explain why it was worth watching.**  
  
**Model Answer:**  
Three years ago I watched the play 'Romeo &amp; Juliet' by William Shakespeare
at the city theatre that I consider a worth watching theatrical performance.
The play lasted for about 1 and half hour and I as well as the 200 audiences
of the play thoroughly enjoyed and acclaimed the play.  
  
The city theatre is famous for quality performance by the top class
performers. The time when we heard that a team is coming from London to
perform Romeo and Juliet, we planned to watch it. We knew very little about
the actors and actresses but heard that they are quite popular in theatrical
world in London. After the play began I noticed a pin drop silence on the
theatre except the performers' voices and background music. The costumes of
the performers were just the way it should be. Their dresses, stage, music,
their make-up, their accent, the passionate acting created an illusion of real
Romeo-Juliet era. The play went on and the story continued as --  
  
"Two young people fall in love the moment they met but their families are
bitter enemies. The relationship between Romeo &amp; Juliet fueled the angers
and bitterness of the two families. The two innocent lovers get caught in the
middle of a trap. The tragic end of their lives and the eternal victory of
love described in Shakespeare's gorgeous language makes it a worth watching
theatrical performance."  
  
The professional and astounding acting, captivating dialogues, intense
romantic tale, wrenching separation and the tragic twist of tale make the play
unforgettable and timeless. The production and acting were superb and highly
acclaimed. I still remember a news article later on that acclaimed the actors,
actresses of the London team and the superb professionalism and artistic
production of a great play.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

A theatrical performance refers to a live play performance by actors in front
of the audiences. To answer this cue card try to remember a play you have
watched in a theater. If you have never watched such a live theatrical
performance, try to visualize one and describe it.  
  
You can either talk about a famous play that you watched in a theater like a
play written by a famous play writer (Shakespeare is most famous for his
playwriting and his plays are performed almost everywhere). Alternatively you
can also talk about a play that was written by a play writer in your country
or was made based on a historically significant event of your country.  
  
The play is usually performed in a theater or a big auditorium. Sometimes
temporary theaters are made for the purpose. You should describe what play it
was and who the play writer was. Then talk about your reason to go there and
how much the ticket cost you (if it was not free).  
  
Give a summary of the story line and describe how the play went on. To give a
through description of the topic in the due time, try to tell the story in 45
seconds and then make some comments from a critic’s point of view.  
  
Since the cue card asks you to talk about a worth watching theatrical
performance, you must mention that this was a very fantastic performance and
the performance of the actors were highly appreciated. Relate the story line
with the significance of it and give reason why you recommend others to watch
it.  
You should not mention that that the play was not a good one to watch or it
did not attract you that much because you are not talking about a theatrical
performance rather you are talking about a worth watching theatrical
performance.  
  
For the question ‘who participated’ you can tell the name of some famous
theatrical performers or can make a general statement that you do not know
their names but you know that they are highly acclaimed performers.  
  
For the question “The acting and quality of the production” you should praise
the performance and mention some of the reason that made it a good play to
watch. Some of you won’t have the understanding of the production of the play
and yet make some general statements that the production was good, people
praised the acting and production, it touched you and people were highly
appraising the performance.  
  
Finally say that you enjoyed it very much and this was a very high quality
theatrical performance that you personally feel others should watch.  
  
If you can answer this cue card, you would also be able to answer the
following cue cards:  
  
**1\. Describe a live performance you have watched.  
2\. Describe a performance that you enjoyed.  
3\. Describe a public event or performance that you enjoyed very much.**

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a stressful day at school/ university/ work.

**You should say:**

  * How the day started
  * How things went wrong
  * Who the people involved were

**and explain why it was stressful.**

**Model Answer:**  
There are many stressful days I remember from University as well as from work
and among them I would like to talk about one particular stressful day at my
work. It was a project deadline that we were supposed to deliver before the
Christmas holiday. It was due at 15th December 2-3 years back and we were in a
good ground to deliver the task to the client. It was a major client of our
company and the project was a crucial one for the client as well.  
  
We were 8 people involved in this project and on 12th December we revised the
project and found that we need to review only before sending the final version
of the software application. Next 2 days were day-offs and all of a sudden I
got a call from my office that something went wrong regarding the project and
the software was not running as expected. I came to office at around 9.00 am
on Saturday and found other members had already come or on their way to
office.  
  
Initially we thought that there would be few bugs on our code and that should
not take more than 2-3 hours for us to fix them. But to our surprise we found
that the code is a mess and nothing is in order. We started revising the code
and found that some of the files had been overridden by newer files which were
completely empty. We felt like the sky had just fallen down on our heads and
we are in the middle of a deserted area. We all looked at the project manager
who was busy talking to the product owner and could guess the hot
conversation.  
  
I found some of my files were missing from the project and the backup system
was not working. We spent 2-3 hours to discuss the situation and tried to find
out what should we do. The project manager explained we have no other choice
but to work on the missing files all again to make it work.  
  
I was very tired and was getting calls from home to attend a family occasion.
I felt really helpless and could not be sure if I should leave for few hours
to attend the family occasion or not. I explained the project manager that I
have to attend the occasion and then I will get back to office. He agreed and
I ran for home. From there we went to a relative's house and again I came back
to office in the afternoon. I found that things were as they were before I
left office and everybody became worried about the project.  
We worked till 11.30 pm and then decide to let the client know the real
situation. We emailed the owner and then emailed to the client that, we would
need few more days to finish the project. On that day when I returned home at
around 12:45 am, I felt very stressed and tired. I wished the next day would
be different.  
  
We had to work quite hard for the next few days to make things right. And most
surprisingly we had been able to deliver the project to the client on 20th
December. Though it made some trouble to the client, he was so understanding
and cooperative that he did not complained about it and appreciated us for the
hard work.

###  Tips for Answering this Cue card Sample:

If you are a student, then talk about a stressful day at your university. On
the contrary, if you are a business person or a service holder, talk about a
stressful day at your office or at your workplace/ business place.  
  
**Following are some of the hints to describe a stressful day:**  
  
1\. The day started badly: You were late to reach the university/ office/
workplace.  
2\. Your car stopped all of a sudden and you had to spend more than an hour to
reach to the nearby mechanic shop.  
3\. The traffic police asked for your driving papers and you could not found
it.  
4\. One of your family members was sick and yet you had to leave home for
class/ work.  
5\. You had a minor accident on your way.  
6\. You were late for an exam/ meeting or an important schedule.  
7\. One of your co-workers did not show up who was very important for that
day's task.  
8\. You had a quarrel with your colleague or classmates.  
9\. You had a dead line and you had to work very hard for the whole day. That
was mentally as well as physically stressful.  
10\. You had to finish a task and hand over it to the teacher/ client but you
and your team members could not quite finish it.  
11\. You worked till late night.  
12\. There were some hot arguments with your teacher/ class mates/ captains/
clients.  
13\. You were ill and the stress was too hard for you to bear.

A stressful day is usually a day they would start badly and to meet a
particular deadline, you would have to push your limit. You would be mentally
and physically exhausted and you would work for a long time. So try to
describe a day from the beginning till the end and mention some of the points
mentioned above to describe you are mentioning it as a stressful day. Not
necessarily a single event makes a day stressful, rather the day might become
stressful because of the series of events.

  
**Some similar Cue Card topics:**

**1\. Describe a day that was very exhaustive for you.  
2\. Talk about a bad traffic experience you have.  
3\. Talk about an event when you were late.  
4\. Describe a day when you were very tired.**

##  Describe a practical skill you have

  * What the skill is
  * How often you use it
  * Who taught it to you

**and explain how it helps you in your life. **

**Follow up Questions:**

  * What skills are important for jobs sector in your country?
  * Why students should focus on practical aspects of education than theoretical aspects?
  * Why having technical skills are important?

**Possible Answer:**  
The practical skill that I have is digital / computer designing. I had a
passion on designing and art in my childhood and after my father bought me a
computer when I was in class 7, I started my journey towards the designing.

I still remember that I started my painting on MS- Paint and later on I
learned 2-3 major designing software namely Photoshop and Illustrator. I tool
2 year's diploma course on designing and have worked for card, banner, poster,
logo and web designing. Besides, I have learned how to create a webpage after
designing it.

I have gained the skill by practicing a lot. I read different books on
designing how to and concepts, spent numerous hours on designing and learned
many things from the teachers who used to take our classes. I have learned
many designing aspects, tips and tutorials from different design related
websites as well.

Practice and the opportunity to work on several tasks helped me master the
skill. I still need a long way to go and I am still a passionate designer.
Besides my academic study, I still work on designing specifically on
freelancing projects and that brings me a good amount of money.

I am sure this skill will help me do even better in the professional sector in
the future.

sample%2F627-ielts-cue-card-sample-44-describe-a-child-you-
know&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a child you know.

**You should say:**

  * Who the child is
  * How you know him/her
  * How you act with the child

**and explain why you like/ dislike this child.**

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * Describe your childhood.
  * What are the responsibilities of parents to help the children grow-up properly?

**Model Answer:**  
My grandfather had been the father of six children and later on when they
became parents, the family grew up quite large. In our joint family there are
several children and among them the youngest boy of my elder sister is the one
I'd like to talk about. He is 4-5 years old and is my most favourite nephew.
His name is Abraham and I call him Nir. I still remember the day he came in to
this world and I chose to name him Abraham. He lives with his parents in a
different city and they visit us almost 3-4 times each year.

From his childhood he was very cute and adorable. I loved him very much and
because of my affection towards him, he became very fond of me. I usually see
him with an interval of 3/4 months and each time I get the feeling that he has
grown up more.

We often play hide-and-seek and cricket together with other people and kids.
He loves to listen to the ghost stories, adventurous stories and fairy
stories. While their stay at our home, he stays with me at night and I tell
him bed time stories. We often go to walk in the field, go to open places like
parks, near river and forest. He likes ice-cream and I buy him chips, ice-
creams and chocolates. He loves sweet and hates to eat any pungent food. I
often cuddle him, make fun with him and play with him.  
  
My affection and love for him is acute and I love to spend time with him.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

This cue card asks you to talk about a child whom you know. So this child can
be someone from your family, a neighboring child, a child of your relative or
can be even your own kid 9 if you have one!). If this is a kid from your
family, it is expected that you know his/ her name so mention his/her name and
if this child from your neighbour mention who the parents are how you know
about them.

  * To give identity of the kids and to give details mention the following points:
  * His/ her name.
  * Parents' names &amp; relationship with you.
  * How old the kid is.
  * How s/he looks.
  * How he interacts with you
  * How you treat him/her.
  * How often you see and interact him/her.
  * How you feel about this kid.
  * What you do with this kid.

If you talk about a kid who is less than 2 years old, there would be very
little to talk about him/her. Try to talk about a child of 5-7 years old and
thus you would be able to give details about him/her, how s/he interacts with
you, how you treat him/ her etc.

If you can talk about this topic you should be able to talk about the
following cue cards as well:  
  
**1\. Describe someone in your family.  
2\. Describe someone you really like.  
3\. Describe someone you often play with.  
4\. Describe a kid you know.  
5\. Talk about a neighboring child you know.  
6\. Describe a child you really love to spend time with.  
7\. Describe one of your relatives.**

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 45 - Describe a river or a sea you have visited

sample%2F628-ielts-cue-card-sample-45-describe-a-river-or-a-sea-you-have-
visited&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a river or a sea you have visited.

**You should say:**

  * Where the river/ sea was
  * What activities you did there
  * Who was with you

**Explain why you liked this particular place and why do you recommend the place for others to visit.**

**Follow-up Questions:**

  * What are the differences between a road trip and a boat trip?
  * What are the importances of rivers in your country?

**Model Answer:**  
I have once been at Cox's Bazar for about a week and really enjoyed my visit
there. Cox's Bazar is considered to be the largest sea beach in the world and
it is beside the Bay-of-Bengal. We had the trip to visit the sea, beach and
natural beauty of this place.  
  
Three of our friends including me went there in 2010 probably around June.
This was a good time to visit the sea beach. We stayed at hotel which was very
close to the sea. We could hear the roaring sounds of the sea from our hotel
especially at night. The sea seems endless and this was my first time to see
the vastness of the sea. I tried to imagine the position of the other shore of
the sea and the depth of it and after sometimes abandoned this silly idea! I
was really surprised when we took a motor-boat to visit a nearby island. All I
could see was water around us. The waves were so enormous and high that I
thought this would hit us hard and our boat would sink. I am not ashamed to
disclose that I was bit frightened about the big waves and our small boats.  
  
At night I walked beside the sea, I watched the lives surrounding the sea,
people and their culture. The moon looked like a hanging light in the wall on
the other side of the sea. The sea looked less formidable at night except the
sound which was louder at night. The people, tourists from different
locations, local people, fishermen, the long sea beach and the sea exposed a
life and place that we never knew about. I enjoyed fresh foods and fishes,
different culture of people, the vastness of the sea, the hotel, the working
class people and their mildness and have planned to visit the place again
whenever possible.

###  Tips for answering this cue card question:

You can either talk about your visit to a sea or to a place near a river. Do
not describe only the sea or the river as the cue card expects you to describe
your whole trip, not the river or sea only. But as part of your trip you have
to describe how was the sea/ river, where it is, what you did there, how long
you stayed there, a bit about your journey and stay, what different things you
observed there, what things you have enjoyed there and who was/ were with you.  
  
If you describe a sea, you should talk about a real sea and give some factual
information as people would already know about this sea. On the other hand, if
you talk about a river, you can mention any river you have seen.  
  
**Some common things people do in their trip to a sea:**  
1\. Enjoy the vastness of the sea.  
2\. Take sunbath in the sea beach.  
3\. People do some surfing and riding near the sea beach.  
4\. They walk beside the sea beach.  
5\. They enjoy the heavy tide and the sound of it.  
6\. They eat fresh sea foods.  
7\. They get down in the sea water and take bath.  
8\. They take photos and enjoy the sun rise and sun set.  
  
**Some common activities people do on their trip to a river:**  
1\. Enjoy the sweet breeze.  
2\. People catch fishes from the river.  
3\. They swim in the river.  
4\. They enjoy the natural beauty besides the river.  
5\. They seat near the river and enjoy the scenic beauty.  
6\. They do some short of picnic there.  
  
Your preparation for this cue card would help you answering the following cue
cards as well:  
**1\. Describe a place near lots of water.  
2\. Describe your experience of the boat journey.  
3\. Describe your experience of visiting a sea beach.  
4\. Talk about a trip you had.  
5\. Describe a journey you recently took.**

in-your-country&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about your most favourite Season in your country

**You should say:**

  * What is it and when does it come?
  * Why do you like it?
  * Changes happen in this season.
  * Things you like to do in this season.

**And explain the season in brief.**

**Follow-up Questions:**  
1\. Describe the seasons in your country.  
2\. What is the most comfortable season in your country?  
3\. What's the necessity of clothes in a particular season?  
4\. What are the seasons you have in your country but other countries do not.

**Model Answer 1:**  
I come from the United Kingdom, where talking about the weather is always a
topic of conversation.  That is because we have four different seasons, and
each is special and beautiful in its own way.  Each different time of year
also has its own distinct weather.  Today I’m going to tell you about my
favourite season, when it is, why I like it and what changes it brings, as
well as the things I like to do during it.

So in the UK, our four seasons are spring, summer, autumn and winter.  I like
all of them in a way, but if I must choose, then I think my favourite must be
autumn.  Autumn is usually between around September and November each year,
though it can shift a little if we have a long hot summer.

Factually, autumn is the time of year when the days start to get shorter
again, the temperature cools and plants and trees start to shut down and
prepare for winter.  You might think this would be depressing, but I don’t
think so.  For me, autumn is something of a relief.  I get terrible hay fever
in the summer from pollen, and I’m not great in the heat, so I find the
temperature much more comfortable in autumn and I can be a lot more active and
do more things.  The best thing about autumn is the way that the trees change
colour.  I’m lucky, because I live near woodlands.  As autumn begins the
leaves on trees transform from green to rich oranges; vivid yellows; warm
browns and blinding gold.  If you have never seen a forest in autumn, it’s
quite hard to imagine, but really and truly, at this time of year, if the
autumn sun catches leaves as they blow off in the wind they can look like
flames or pure gold.  It is astonishingly beautiful.

I also like to be outside, in summer, everyone else has the same idea, but in
the autumn there are still some mild days to be enjoyed and I like to wrap up
warm and head off for long walks in the blustering wind and have the
countryside all to myself.  I like to look out for wildlife and interesting
plants on my treks.  Sometimes I’ll go walking or running with a friend and it
feels like the whole place up on the hills belongs just to us.

So for me, autumn is special because of its beautiful colours; the lack of
pollen to give me hay fever, the possibility of long country walks and being
able to enjoy our wonderful British countryside all to myself!

Eventually autumn ends, and it becomes very dark and cold as we move into
winter.  I’m not so keen on that as there is very little daylight and it seems
to go on for ever.  On the other hand we have some great winter festivals:
Halloween; Bonfire night and of course Christmas, so every season has its good
points in my view!

_[ Written by -** Lucy Marris **|  Careers Adviser (UK), TEFL teacher
(Vietnam)]_

**Model Answer 2:**  
My most favorite season is fall and I love everything about it. Usually it
starts at the end of May in our country and lasts till the middle of July.  
The weather is best during fall and you won't feel the heat of summer or the
cold wind of winter. The nature arranges itself with the beautiful green and
flowers are noticed all around the places.  
  
I like the scenic beauty, charming weather, festivities and freshness of this
season. This is a distinctive season and is known as the queen of seasons in
our country. The newly grown green leaves of trees, the colorful flowers, the
chirping of the birds and crisp and mild air of fall are some of the
noticeable changes in our country. After the hot summer ends, the falls comes
and people in our country love this season.  
  
Fall is season that marks the transition from summer into winter and the night
falls later than winter. The farmers start harvesting seeds in this season and
they become quite active during this season.  
  
I usually get vacation at the beginning of the fall and visit my hometown.
This is a perfect vacation for me as my hometown becomes even more beautiful.
Because of geographical location and culture, we have 2-3 major festival
during this time and people enjoys the festivals and weathers.

###  Tips for answering this Cue card topic:

When you are asked to talk about your favorite season, you should mention one
of the seasons that you enjoy on your counry. In some countries (example: the
USA) four seasons are prominent while in some Asian countries there are six
seasons. Do not talk about a season which is not available in your country.

For this cue card, start by saying the name of your favorite season and then
mention the months that this season usually lasts. Then mention the changes
which are very prominent in this season and things people do during this
season. Each season has its own specialty that makes it distinguishable.
Mention this special feature of this season. Now move on to the activities you
do during this season. Your activity and how you spent time during this season
is closely related for the question why you like this season over other
seasons.

**Give some reasons why you particularly like this season. For this you can mention some of the points listed below:**  
  
1.    This is the most comfortable season in our country.  
2.    The nature appears like a queen in this season and the nature shows all
of her beauty during the time of this season.  
3.    People get vacations and enjoy this season.  
4.    Different activities are performed in my country during this season.  
5.    I get vacation and enjoy my stay at my village during this season.  
6.    After a long extreme weather, this season brings a comfortable
temperature which I really enjoy.  
7.    No serious diseases outburst during this season.  
8.    People in my country mostly enjoy their activities during this season.  
9.    Our cultural and historical events somehow are related to this season
and that’s why a festive mode stays during this season.

  
 If you have already covered the changes appear in this season then you should
give a conclusion and finish you speaking. If you have not given enough
details of this season, this is the perfect time to give the details of this
season.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. Describe the seasons in your country.**  
**Answer:** I come from Greece so I'm going to tell you about the seasons there. There are four seasons in Greece- Autumn, Winter, Spring and Summer and each one lasts three months. September, October and November constitute the autumn season, with basic characteristics the transition from hot to cool and mild weather. Winter starts in December and ends in February and the main features of this season are rain, cold weather and sometimes snowfall. Christmas and New Year are celebrated during the winter season and despite these adverse and unwanted weather conditions, there are many people who declare that this is their favourite period of the year. Spring and summer are the last two seasons of the year. Spring  consists of March, April and May and the latter June, July and August fall in the summer season. In spring flowers and trees blossom and the temperature fluctuates between 15 and 25 degrees. Summer is identified by hot weather, many insects and of course the sun, sea and vacation. 

**Q. What is the most comfortable season in your country?**  
**Answer:** This question is kind of ambiguous for me and the answer, I believe, would differ from person to person. From my point of view, although I adore summer, I can't stand the overwhelming hot weather and mosquitoes, which I'm allergic to. Spring is also a lovely season, but during this season I suffer from blooming flowers and I am forced to take medication to dampen this harsh and unpleasant situation, causing many side effects. Winter is a favourite season of mine because Christmas and New Year are involved, but I can't stand the constant rainy and extremely cold weather. So, I would jump to the conclusion that autumn is the most comfortable season for me, because the weather is great, neither too cold nor too hot, there aren't many blooming flowers and mosquitoes and other types of insects. I believe many others in Greece would also agree that this is the most comfortable season.    
  
_**Tip: **_Pay attention that the question is about the **most comfortable**
season and not you favourite. So you have to tell the examiner about the
season that is convenient in your own country. The answer may vary because
each country has different types of seasons with regards to weather
conditions, and climate.

**Q. What's the necessity of clothes in a particular season?**  
**Answer:** It is commonly accepted that suitable clothes are worn to protect people from different weather conditions and to ensure comfort in various seasons. More precisely, in the winter people wear attires in order to remain warm and the most representative examples are sweaters, boots, coats, scarves, gloves and so on. In autumn and spring, people don't wear too heavy clothing because the weather is milder in comparison to winter. Summer, is characterized by hot and sunny weather in most places and people prefer to wear clothes such as shorts, t-shirts, sleeveless garments, sandals and caps. So I would infer that in each of the four seasons people need different types of clothes in order to be able to stand the various weather conditions without any problems. 

**Q. What are the seasons you have in your country but other countries do not.**  
**Answer:** That's a difficult question actually and requires knowledge about seasons in other countries too. The truth is I'm not knowledgeable about other countries' seasons, but I would try and answer that question using the information I have known so far. I think that in Africa seasons are much different than those of other countries. Africa has all the four seasons mentioned, but not in the same months. Summer, the so-called 'Calving Season', is considered to be from December to March and although is called 'summer', the highest temperature is 28C and the lowest 15C. Autumn, 'Green Season', starts in late March and ends in June. Winter, 'Jump Season', is from July through to August and despite it's called 'winter', most days people only need a t-shirt by lunch time. Lastly, spring is the 'Dry season' and lasts three months, September, October and November. Interestingly some Asian countries like Bangladesh has six seasons. The summer season in Arabic countries are quite hot and their seasons are quite different than that of many European countries.

**Model Answer:**  
Sydney is my most favorite city among the cities I have visited. Sydney is the
state capital of New South Wales of Australia. This city is situated in the
bank of Tasman Sea and has around 4.6 million people. I have visited this city
in 2008, after I finished my graduation and loved my stay there. Sydney had
many attractive natural area, botanic garden, parks, and high rising
buildings. This city has many heritage listed building that attracts the
tourists and visitors. The Sydney Opera House is one of the most recognized
landmarks in Australia and is a great place to visit.  
  
This city is known for the dynamic cultural hub and it has many famous museum,
galleries and art galleries as well. Because of the great architecture, warm
weather and hundreds of tourists attraction more than 11 million international
and domestic tourists visit this city each year. I had been there for about 15
days and I really enjoyed everything about this city. I stayed at a 20 storied
hotel that offered a really amusing sight views. The transportation system of
the city is better than many other cities and I could have been maintaining
the track and time of my schedules because of that. I loved being at open
&amp; wide spaces in the gardens and parks. People are welcoming and friendly
there. A tourist can get plenty of helps both from people and the authority
and can roam easily without any interruption. I saw 2/3 art museum and some
cultural festivals and those were awesome.  
  
There are so many places to be, so many things to do in Sydney. Some of the
attractive places are: Royal Botanic Garden, Hyde Park, Queen Victoria
Building, Sydney Town hall, Macquarie Lighthouse, Australia Square, Sydney
Opera House and many more.  
I had a tremendous vacation in Sydney and I liked most of the places there and
I enjoyed so much that I did not even notice how quickly the 2 weeks scheduled
time has passed.

A Shopping Mall you often visit

  * How often do you go there and what do you buy from there
  * What types of people usually go there
  * Describe the Shipping centre

**and explain why you like it.**  


**Follow-up Questions: **  
What are some advantages and disadvantages of big shopping centre?  
Tell me about some newly build shopping centre in your city.  
Why supermarket are getting more popular now-a-days?

**Possible Answer:**  
I am from Ho Chi Minh City and I like the Diamond Plaza shopping mall that I
often visit. It is best known as the Diamond Plaza and is situated at 34 Le
Duan Street, near the Notre Dame Cathedral. I visit this shopping mall almost
twice in a month and sometimes more frequent than that.  
  
People from nearby places and from the city are the most frequent visitors but
it's not uncommon that tourists and shoppers from other cities come and shop
from this shopping mall. This shopping center includes a 22 story building
plus an adjacent 15 story building and offers a great shopping experience
including restaurants, cafe, hospital, lounges, Cinema Theater. There is a
helicopter pad on the roof of this mall and offers many other facilities.  
  
The Diamond Plaza shopping mall hosts many renowned brands and offers
distinctive shopping experience. You can find almost everything you need to
shop from here. Many fashion fans find it as their prime place for shopping
and the shopping environment is unmatched. One does not need to be rich to
come and shop here as the goods offered suits the people from economic status.  
  
The food court is something you would love about this shopping mall. There are
more than hundreds of food shops that you can pick from and the game center
attracts mostly the game lovers and teenagers. The movie theater of the
Diamond Plaza is called Lotte Cinema and is in the 13th floor. With the most
modern facility and safe environment this is an ideal shopping center for all
types of shoppers.  
  
I like this shopping mall mostly because of the quality products and good
price offering. Apart from that the security, customer service and nice
environment also attract me. Another reason that affects my shopping decision
from this shopping mall is its distance from my living place. It takes only 15
minutes to reach there and this is one of the reasons I mostly decide to shop
there.  


###  Tips for Answering this Cue Card Topic:

This cue card topic should be an easy one for you to talk about as the listed
questions gives you an advantage to talk about this cue card. First say the
name of the Shopping mall (this can be an entire shopping complex or can be a

mall like M&amp;L is a 15 stories building and this comprises more than 150
shops of different brands. Alternatively you can pick a brand shopping mall
like Hallmark which is a single shopping store. Say the location of the
building or mall in regards to the prominent landmarks of the area and give a
rough estimation how you reach there.

  
About your visiting frequency to the shopping mall, you should mention how
often you go there. Is it very frequent like 1-2 times a week or once in few
months? Then mention the type of brands, products available there and mention
what you usually purchase from there. Regarding the third question “what types
of people usually go there”, you should mention the age group, economic and
social status of the people who usually go there for shopping. Also mention if
mostly female or male go there for shopping. The final two questions require
the most attention of your answer which are “describe the shopping center” and
“why you like it”. For the first one, give the details of the physical
structure of the shopping mall, types of shops and products available there
and give an overall description of the shopping complex.

sample%2F697-ielts-cue-card-sample-78-describe-the-most-beautiful-natural-
scenery&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe the most beautiful natural scenery you have ever seen.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * Where and when you saw it
  * Who was with you

**and explain why do you think this is the most beautiful scenery you have ever seen.**

**Model Answer:**  
When  I was a university student, I went to a village which was the living
place of my best friend's grandfather's house. It was in a remote area and the
natural scenery I saw there was the most beautiful natural scenery I have ever
seen. It was in (...say a place name...) and the small river, the hill, the
green fields and the blue sky made a combination that I felt something out of
the world. I saw it in one autumn evening when I went to explore the
surroundings of the village. That was an awe-inspiring scenery that I will
never forget. I saw this scenic beauty in 2011 and it was mid-autumn season
then.  
  
My friend, I and one of my friend's cousin were present at that time and I
heard from my friend that his village was a very beautiful place. I could not
believe how much beautiful it was until I saw it with my own eyes.  
  
We left for the river in the evening and I was amazed to notice the hill and
slopping road track beside it. The river was flowing gently and the vast paddy
fields were all around us. I heard the chattering of the birds in the green
trees and the sound was creating a harmony in my ears.  
  
To me this was a truly amazing feelings to witness a natural scenery that
could exists only in our imagination. I have seen many rivers, hills and paddy
fields but in my friend's village they were arranged in such a way which is
only possible in an artist's picture. The blue sky seemed very nearer to the
horizon and the vast green all around us make me feel like visiting in a fairy
land.  


###  Tips for talking about this Cue Card Topic:

For this cue card you are expected to talk about a natural scenery that you
have seen and think is the most beautiful. First talk about the place and
scenery. This can be a particular thing (like river, forest, hill, sky,
rainbow, view from mountain, fountain, ocean etc.) or can be a place that has
a really eye-catchy landscape. If this place/scenery has a name, say that and
then mention where it is situated. Then mention when you saw that and how
awestricken you were witnessing this out-of-the-world scenery. Now give the
details of the view/ scenery and mention when you saw it. If you had companies
and relatives, mention who they were and why they went with you. Also mention
if this was a planned trip or a sudden encounter of the scenery.

The final question is a tricky one and in your answer you have to convince the
examiner why you think that was the most beautiful scenery you have ever seen.
The debate for most beautiful scenery is ever ending and in fact the most
beautiful scenery to someone should be based on his/her personal experience.
So emphasize your personal experience and feeling when you witnessed this
scenery. Mention that you are yet to explore lots of beautiful places of the
world and so far in your small experience this was the most beautiful scenery
you have ever seen.

  
**Your ability to answer this cue card should enable you to answer the following cue cards as well:**  
  
**1\. Describe a worth visiting place.  
2\. Describe a trip you recently had.  
3\. Describe a picnic spot you know about.  
4\. Describe a natural place near water or sea.  
5\. Describe a place you would like to visit.  **

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an important festival in your country

**You should say:**

  * what is it
  * what is the significance of it
  * what do you do / how do you celebrate

**and describe the festival in details.**  
  
**Follow-up Questions:**

  * What are some important festivals in your country?
  * What special foods and activities are connected with this festival?
  * What do you most enjoy about a festival?
  * Why festivals are important for a culture/ country?

**Cue Card Answer 1: **  
China is a country of numerous festivals and we love to celebrate different
occasions whole-heartedly. In fact there are so many festivals in China and it
is quite tough for me to pick a particular favourite. I would love to talk
about the Spring Festival, which is also known as Chinese New Year, as I
personally enjoy it quite a lot. Other prominent festivals like National Day,
Yung Xiao Festival, Lantern Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-autumn
Festival etc are also widely celebrated in our country.  
  
The Spring Festival is the biggest festival in our country and this festival
touches every single street and every single citizen of China. I suppose it is
somewhat like the Christmas festival is in Western countries in terms of
celebration and like the New Year festival in terms of its norm. If someone
visits our country during the Spring Festival, he will surely notice the
colourful and distinguishable look the houses and streets have. This is the
time for families to gather together and enjoy their time. People get together
with their family members during this time and they seems happy for that. Many
stores and businesses remain closes during this time and people cook delicious
food, visit relatives &amp; friends, watch TV, gossip together, wear new
dresses and welcome New Year. Many traditional food items are cooked during
this time and the aroma of delicious foods could be easily found during this
time.  
  
Visiting relatives and friends is a custom I really like about this festival.
This is a festival that remains for several days and personally I find it very
enjoyable as I get together with my family. I also contact some of my friends
and enjoy our time together. I invite them to have dinner with us and I often
roam around the streets with them. Welcoming the New Year is another important
aspects of this festival. We wish each other a happy and prosperous new year
and exchange gifts with friends and family members.

**Model answer 2:**  
Bengali New year day, which is the First day of the Bengali calendar, is a
very important festival in our country. This is usually occurs on 14th or 15th
April and celebrated among the Bengali people, minor Bengali communities and
in some states of the India. The famous Mughal Emperor Jalaludding Muhammad
Akbar introduced the Bengali Calendar most probably because of easier tax
collection of that time.  
  
This is possibly the most widely celebrated festival in our country. People
from all social-economic states, from all ages and all religions celebrate
with great joy, festivity and happiness. The rally, the song, the traditional
dresses, the traditional foods, the boat racing, cock-fight, pigeon racing and
many more activities are very common in this festival.

The people celebrate this festival whole day starting from the early morning.
Men, women, kinds all were the traditional dresses, draws some temporary arts
and tattoos, goes to the central University place and enjoys the festival
greatly.  
  
The whole capital city as well as other places of the country warmly welcome
the New Year and as a long tradition cook delicious dishes. This is a festival
which is rooted in our history. Usually people get their harvest at that time
and makes different delicious foods. After the emperor Akbar introduced this
Bengali New Year, we are celebrating with great enthusiasm and in a
distinctive way.  
  
No other festival depicts the true traditions and cultures as does the Pohela
Boishak.



###  Tips for answering this Cue Card topic:

An important festival of a country can be a major religious festival, music

celebration or a religious festival and then say the significance of this
celebration in your country. To mention the significance of the festival, give
the historical/ religious/ cultural origin of the festival and also mention

sample%2F680-ielts-cue-card-sample-70-describe-a-relative-whom-you-
like&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a relative whom you like.

**You should say:**

  * Who the relative is and how close you are to him/ her.
  * What makes you like your relative.
  * What do you do together

**and describe why this person is close to you.**

**Possible Answer:**  
I like many of my relatives and among them I'd like to pick my Grandma whom I
really love and admire. She is a loving woman who always loves me. She lives
with us and very close to me. I share lots of my own stuffs with her. She
cares me like a mother does for her own kids. She tells me stories, some of
her own and some of them are from her young time. She has a good heart and she
is nice to others.  
  
In the morning she wakes me up and we go out for morning walk. All of our
family members take our breakfast together. Sometimes I read her books and
watch religious TV programs together. Sometimes I urge my wish to her and then
she bargains it with my parents. In a way she is a very close friend of mine.

My grandma is very fond of me and I like her very much as well. We have a good
bonding between us that makes our relationship easy and soothing.  


**Alternative Answer:**  
I like many of my relatives who are very compassionate, lovely and friendly to
me and among them I would pick my younger uncle as the best relative in terms
of our mutual understanding, closeness and communications. In fact, we share
so many common interest and activities that he is more like a friend to me
than a guardian. I am very close to him and we share our books, thought and
views on different issues like two close friends would do.  
  
I like him because of his authentic compassion, support for me and because of
the common interest he shares with me. I personally find him very benevolent
and talented and he is a good counsellor for me. I respect him and it
surprises me the way he treats me. I have never found him to ignore me and
treat me as a younger nephew ever and that’s something I really like about
him.  
  
We often discuss our family issues, our thoughts of the politics, religion,
books writers, movies, music and on many other issues. We share our books and
recommend books to each other. I find his taste very much similar to me and
that makes us do lots of things together including travelling, watching
movies, spending holidays together and many more activities someone would like
to do with friends. He even spends time with my friends without any
hesitation.  
  
I am the only child of my parent and from my childhood I found that my younger
uncle was living in our house. This was the main reason we became close and
apart from that the shared interests, his personality and behavior actually
made us close. He took care of me in my childhood and supported me in many
ways in my teenage and with time I became very close to him.

###  Tips for answering this cue card speaking topic:

For this cue card, talk about any close or distant relative you have whom you
like. This includes, your uncles, aunts, grandparents, cousins, relatives by
bloods. Try not to talk about your parents, siblings, friends, neighbors and
specifically exclude the friends and neighbors as they are not treated as
relatives at all.  
  
For the first question “Who the relative is and how close you are to him/ her”
say your relationship with him/her, then name and for how long you know this
relative. Then to describe how close you are, mention one or two events you
did together to prove that you are actually very close to this relative.  
  
For the next question “What makes you like your relative?” describe the common
interest you two have, how you treat each other, his/her personality and good
quality, your memory about him/ her and finally the support you got from this
relative.  
  
You have already mentioned one / two activities you two do together, now for
the third question you should give a series of activities you two do together
including the conversation you have.  
  
Now that you have said that this person is very close to you, cares you,
friendly and benevolent; the time has come for you to describe why s/he is
close to you. If you are talking about a close relative like younger aunt,
uncle etc. mention that s/he lives with your family. If it is a cousin you can
say you two live in the same community and thus meet each other daily. Finally
if it is a distant relative, mention you often visit each other. Now talk
about your common interest, activities, his/her excellent personality and
talent, helpfulness etc. made you two very close. Actually people get close
for two reasons: one, if their common interests and notions have similarities
or if they live together. Obviously there are other parameters as well but
mentioning these two reasons for your closeness would be convincing for the
question “and describe why this person is close to you”.  
  
**Similar cue card topics that you should be able to answer as well:**

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a place that you like to go

**You should say:**

  * Where the Place is
  * How you get there
  * What it looks like

**and explain why you like this place.**

**Model Answer 1: **  
There are lots of places I like to go, depending on my mood.  Today ‘though,
I’m going to tell you about a special place near to where I live.  I will
explain where it is and how I get there.  I will try and describe what it
looks like and explain why I like the location so much.

I am lucky, although I live in a city, from my house I can walk to the edges
of the Peak District, which is a beautiful national park just a few miles from
the city centre.  To get to the national park I have to walk from my house
down some local roads, and up a steep hill past some allotments.  After about
a mile or so striding out away from the urban areas, I get to a lovely bit of
woodland which has a public footpath you can follow onwards and upwards.  It
can be a bit of a scramble towards the end of the path as it is very steep
indeed, but eventually you leave the woodland and are on the edge of open farm
land.  Another footpath crosses some sheep-filled fields, and finally you are
on the moors of the Peak District.  It is really spectacular.

The Peak District can be a really wild place, with its vast expanses of open
moorland.  You are high up, and it is quite exposed so it can be very windy
and cold even in the summer.  There are rocky outcrops and strange
configurations of stones that have been weathered by centuries of wind and
rain to create dramatic shapes.  Some boulders are in piles, and there are
steep vertical cliffs too.  The area attracts lots of people who like walking,
climbing and bouldering because of its unique and beautiful landscape.
Everywhere is dark wet peat under foot, and lots of heather.  This is a low
growing plant that flowers at the end of the summer turning the whole
landscape purple.  The park covers a huge area, I think around 555 square
miles, so the terrain differs from area to area, of course I am biased, but I
believe I live near the most remarkably beautiful part.

I love this place, because if ever I am feeling down, or a bit enclosed, in
just an hours walk I can find myself in a deserted but picturesque place,
where the elements are more extreme.  In winter rain and wind can batter you,
but in summer the sky seems to go on for ever.  Every day is different up
there, and every hour of every day too.  The area is so huge, that often you
can have it all to yourself, of course there are other walkers about, but you
can quickly disappear in the vastness of the space.   The people who live in
Sheffield, like me, are very proud that we are so near to the Peak District
National Park, and it is no surprise it became the United Kingdom's first
national park on 17 April 1951.  A birthday that should be celebrated I think!

**Model Answer 2: **  
I like to visit my hometown more than visiting any other place. After I
finished my school, I came to the capital of your country and did my
graduation here. Later on, I have started my job and since then have been
staying here. Whenever I get vacations, I plan to visit my hometown.  
  
To go there, I need to purchase advance bus ticket 2-3 days prior to the
departure. I mostly go there by bus. Alternatively, I can go to my hometown on
train. The bus journey takes around 4-5 hours and the train journey takes 1-2
hours more than the bus journey. After reaching at our hometown station, I
usually pick a shared taxi that drops me near my home.

My home town is a small urban area with full of beauty and wonder. Green
trees, fresh air and serene environment make it an ideal place to live in. My
hometown is just beside a river and has less density of population than the
capital city. The houses and shopping Centres are not crammed and have their
own urban charms. My hometown is a special place for me as I have spent my
childhood there. There are three tourist attractions are there and the place
is renowned for traditional foods and customs. Roads are clean and people are
educated there. Anyone who would this place would find it attractive.



###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

This cue card topic gives you a wide range of things that you can talk about.
For example you can talk about your hometown, grandparent’s house, a city you
like, a movie theatre, a shopping mall, a place near sea, amusement park etc.
Since this cue card topic is about a place you like to go, you should first
mention the place and the things of attraction there. Then mention how
frequently you go there, what you do there, who is there, how this is a
special place for you and your reason for liking this place.

If you pick a town or city where you lived or where your relatives still live,
mention the place as well as the people there as you mainly go there too meet
them and in this circumstance, the people are more important to you than the
place itself.

  
If you mention a place like shopping mall, Movie Theater, recreational place,
sports zone etc. mention the activity offered there and the kind of things you
do there.

Finally, mention why this place is important to you. Is it because you enjoy
staying there or the people who live there are the persons you care about. A
good and convincing finishing is required for the final question ‘why you like
this place’ and you should add all the convincing reasons you have for liking
this particular place.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 61 - Tell me about your most favourite music band

sample%2F671-ielts-cue-card-sample-61-tell-me-about-your-most-favourite-music-
band&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Tell me about your most favourite music band.

**You should say:**

  * What is it and why do you like it?
  * How do people react to the music of this band?
  * When you first heard their song?

**and explain the necessity of listening music.**  


**Follow-up Questions:**

  * Why do people listen to music?
  * Talk about the type of international music.
  * What are the some types of traditional music found in your country?
  * How does the internet affect the sales of CV, DVD and Music Albums?
  * What is more important: Traditional music or International Music? Why?

  
**Model Answer:**  
There are many music bands that I like very much but Pink Floyd is my most
favourite music band. This band is a famous music band for their music which
falls under the genre progressive rock, psychedelic rock and art rock. Though
the band is not active anymore yet they are heard by millions of music lovers.
They are basically English rock band that was founded in 1965 and remained
active till 1995 and reunited in 2005. I have become a big fan of this band
mostly because of their distinguished philosophical lyrics, sonic experiment
and mind-blowing music quality.  
  
The Pink Floyd is considered to be one of the most musically influential and
commercially successful bands of all time. Their albums have been sold well
over 250 million records worldwide. Regarding the question how people react to
their music; it depends on the listener and their choice of music but people
good music choice and quality lyrics choice are bound to love the songs of
this band. Each of their album got high appraisal from the music critic and
their album "The Wall" is widely known all over the world.  
  
I have first listened to their music (most probably songs from the album 'Atom
hearted mother') when I was in my 10th grade of school and after than I have
listened to almost all of their songs countless times.  
  
There are many reasons we should listen to music. It is considered to be the
food of soul. Music is refreshing and washes away the tiredness, boredom and
monotonousness. Good lyrics help us brainstorm, understand things more deeply
and from different perspectives, and help grow positive inspiration and
motivation. Music inspires us deeply and eliminates our boredom and narrowness
in life. It is one of the best entertainments and inspirational sources for
human being.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card Speaking topic:

This should be an easy cue card topic as it allows you to talk about any music
band that you like from your country or from internationally renowned music
bands.  
First name the music band and say what type of music band it is (Genre, music
style, lyrics style and member(s) of this music band).  
Now talk about the reasons you like this music band. This part is bit tricky
as this is the part when you need to convince the examiner about your style
and topic of speaking. Try to give some really convincing reasons why you like
this music band.

Some of the common reasons for liking a music band could be:

**The music is touchy/ contemporary  
This is a really famous band for their extraordinary works on music.  
Their music and lyrics are really good.  
They have a large fan base and their works are critically acclaimed.  
They have made a revolution in music.  
All of the members of this music band are famous for their own contribution in
music.  
They have some hit songs that are heard by many people all around the world.  
They have created a new style and music.  
Their lyrics speak of your unspoken words.  
You really enjoy listening their music.  
The songs of this music band have good themes and the lyrics are of high
class.  
The music is heart soothing and you always love to listen to their music.**

  
For the question “**How do people react to the music of this band**”, you
should mention that the fans of this music band revere the songs of this music
band. You should also mention that people have different taste on music and
the tasted vary mostly based on age group and geographical locations. The
people with different music choice or people who do not have taste for this
band sometimes criticize this music band but yet this is a really famous music
band with good number of hits songs.

For the question “**When you first heard their song**”, mention your first
memory of the songs by this music band. If this was recommended by a friend or
relative mention that or say that you heard it on radio or all of a sudden and
liked this music. Also mention that later on you explored the songs of this
music band from your personal interest.  
The final question asks you to explain the necessity of listening music. This
answer should reflect your point of view of listening music. In general terms,
it is considered that music is like foods for the soul. Music is relaxing,
washes away our sorrow and opens new dimensions. A good music related us to
the memory we have and can inspire us. Music is also helpful when we pass
through the depressed and difficult times as music helps us to heal our
wounds.

The above paragraph gives some of the reason we should listen to music but you
certainly have your own reasons and mention that in a logical and convincing
manner in your answer.

  
Some similar cue card topics:  
  
**1.    Describe something you enjoy to do at your leisure time.  
2.    Describe a leisure activity you have.  
3.    Describe a music band you really like.  
4.    Describe a piece of music you really like.**

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an interest or hobby that you particularly enjoy.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * How long have you been doing it
  * Who you do it with

**and explain why this is important to you.**

**Model Answer 1:**  
Today I am going to talk about a hobby I particularly enjoy when I am at home
in the UK.  I will tell you what the hobby is; how long I have been doing it;
who I do it with and why it is important to me.

My hobby is running!  I know I do not really look like a runner, and it is
true I am not very fast, but this is still the activity that I like to do in
my spare time.

I have not been running for very long.  I started running just 18 months ago,
as I decided I needed to get fit, and I thought it would be a cheap way to
exercise.  I did not expect to enjoy myself.  Near to where I live there is a
park.  It is very beautiful with trees and streams.  Each Saturday a large
group of about 500 people meet at 9.00 a.m. in the morning, and go for a 5 km
run together. This event is called Parkrun, and it happens in over 300
different places in the UK each week.  I was nervous when I first went, but
found the group was friendly and encouraging.  Now I go every week, and I even
have trained for some longer races 10 km and my longest was 20 k.m.!

I have made lots of friends through running.  However, the best surprise was
that when I went to my local Parkrun, I met someone I had not seen for over 30
years!  We had been at school together, but did not keep in touch.  We had
both moved to the new city of Sheffield and did not realise we lived so close
to each other.  Now I run with this friend every week, and we go for breakfast
each Saturday after our run.

Running is important to me because it keeps me fit, has helped me make new
friends, and it has shown me that I am not too old to try new things!  I hope
you all find activities that you enjoy doing in your spare time!

**Model Answer 2:**

Blogging is the interest or hobby that I really enjoy and have been doing it
very passionately for the last 2-3 years. Blog is basically the short form of
'weblog' and it lets the blogger write on topic s/he likes. It is very similar
to a website and the blog posts I write is open for anyone to read using
internet. The blogging I am doing is not collaborated with anyone else and I
am alone maintaining and updating it.

The blog I am maintaining has lots of importance both for me and for the
intended readers. For me, the blog helps me improving my writing skill as it
requires lots of content writing, helps me exploring of relevant topics that
improves my knowledge and to upload the images I take with my camera.
Sometimes I write on how-to and tutorials which are helpful for people looking
for it. Sometimes I write on books I read, movies I watch or about new things
I learn and that helps me observing those in a different perspective. People
can comment on the articles I add and thus I have got many others in my blog
who shares similar interest that I have. Thus the importance of my blog
immense to me and I maintain my blog with utmost passion and fervor.  


For writing blog posts I need to explore different topics and thus this habit
helps me increase my knowledge on different topics.



**Model Answer 3:**  
Today I am going to talk about an activity that I do in my spare time.  I will
explain what the hobby is; how long I have been doing it; who I do it with and
why it is important to me.

I don’t think you will be able to guess what my hobby is because it is quite
unusual!  In my free time I work at an Alpaca Farm!  An alpaca is an animal
that is kept for its fleece, they look a little bit like sheep but with a very
long neck!  They are related to camels and llamas which you may recognise more
easily.  They usually live in South America, but there is an Alpaca Farm near
to me in Sheffield and I work there at weekends.  Although it is called an
Alpaca Farm, in fact there are lots of different animals there: horses; goats;
sheep; some ducks and hens and even some llamas.

Working with the alpacas and the other animals on the farm means I have to get
there early in the morning.  I help to feed the animals and clean up after
them.  Sometimes I have to drive a tractor to take hay and water out to the
horses.  Often there are visitors to the farm and I will give them a guided
tour and introduce them to all the different animals.  At some times of year I
help with special jobs to care for them, such as giving injections to protect
them from illnesses or trimming their toenails if they get too long.  My
favourite time of year to help is in the spring when baby Alpacas are born.
New-born alpacas have to stand up very quickly and within hours are drinking
milk from their mothers and running around – it is amazing to watch.

I work on the farm with the farm manager.  He is a very kind and funny man.
Although we might not seem to have much in common on the surface, we get on
really well together.  We laugh and talk all the time whilst we are getting
the jobs done.

Although my hobby is unusual it is very important to me.  My full time job is
in indoors in an office and a lot of the time I am sitting down, so at
weekends I like to get outside into the country side and do some physical work
that is completely different.  I love the animals, the fresh air and the
exercise.  I also really enjoy talking with the farm manager as he can tell
great stories.  In the winter though it can be very cold, and trudging through
3 foot of snow to feed the animals is really exhausting.  On those days I am
glad that working with the Alpacas is just a hobby, I can spend the rest of
the week in the warm!

were-congratulated&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an occasion or event when you were congratulated.

**You should say:**

  * What was the occasion
  * When was it
  * Who congratulated you and why

**and explain how did this make you feel.**

**Model Answer:**  
We all get appreciations for the good things we do for others or for our great
achievements or personal excellence. One such occasion when I was
congratulated was the time when our debate team won the district/ county level
championship.  
  
It was 2001 and I was a student of grade 8. I was an active member of our
school debate team and had participated different solo and team debate
competitions. The yearly inter-school division/ county level championship is
considered to be a prestigious tournament and the final is broadcasted on
local TV channels as well as in the radio. Our school had never been able to
win the championship before 2001, though some of the debate teams participated
till the semi-final round of the championship. This year I was the captain of
the debate team and to everyone's great surprise, we won the final. Most of
the people of our city watched the final on TV and had been very excited,
happy and proud that we won. The school arranged a ceremony to congratulate us
for our achievement and I found more than 5 hundred students, their guardians
and local people were present there. I was so proud, happy and excited about
the occasion and when all those people started congratulating me, I felt like
I was flying above the sky.  
  
Later I received many congratulations and appreciations in my life but the
excitement and joy I felt at that occasion was incomparable. We walked though
the long line towards the stage and people stood up and clapped their hands
and were greeting us. Out teachers, local political leaders, upper level
government employees and renowned persons of the locality were also present
there. The program lasted for 2/3 hours and we got many gifts and bouquets as
well.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

This cue card demands you to talk about an occasion when other people
congratulated you for something good you did or achieved. Start this cue card
speaking topic by clearing describing the occasion. Also mention how old you
were at that time and what was the reason of this occasion. Since the second
question asks “when it was”, try to give the year of the occasion and if this
is not possible mention how long ago it was and how old you possibly were at
that time.  
  
There can be two different scenarios for the occasion of the congratulation:  
  
1\. That was to reward you for a fine performance or extraordinary
achievement.

the-future&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something you plan to learn in the future.

**You should say:**

  *     what you plan to learn in the future
  *     why you want to learn it
  *     where and how you will learn it

**and explain why your have plan to learn it.**

**Model Answer 1:**  
I have a long desire to learn how to play a piano. Even after my desire and
passion, I have not been able to learn it. If I ever get the time and
opportunity to learn it, I would grab the chance.  
  
I am not sure exactly when this passion grew in me, but I can guess it was
something that came in my mind after I saw a foreign movie where an actor
played this instrument. The movie was related to a musician's life and he
mostly played piano and sang songs.  
  
In the movie the actor played the piano 3-4 times and the quality of the music
was really good. Possibly from that time the passion started to grow in my
mind. I work as a computer programmer and have no intension to do any serious
type music, but I want to learn to play the piano. If I get spare time and my
schedule allows me, I will get admitted in a piano lesson in my city. Not many
opportunities are there but I heard that there are 2/3 musicians who teach
enthusiast people the piano for a high payment. I will probably get admitted
in such a program and would keep learning.  
  
I will need to save around $1000 to get admitted in to the piano lesson and
hopefully will have this amount at the end of next year. Then I will talk to
the musicians who offer the lesson and would pick one to learn from. I'll
allow me to be free at least 2 days in a week to participate in the lesson and
I would practice at least for an hour daily.  
I know it takes a great determination, passion and talent to learn a creative
thing like piano, but I believe, I will be able to achieve it.

**Sample Answer 2: **  
I would say, I want to learn computer programming in the future. More
specifically, I want to learn C# (C Sharp) and PHP which are two very common
yet powerful programming languages. Besides I want to enhance my skill in
database programming so that I can combine those skills to develop great
desktop and web based software and applications.  
  
I come from commerce background and I have finished my undergraduate degree in
business studies. During my 4th and 5th terms in the university, I got
admitted in a computer training centre and learned the basic of computing and
programming. At that time I was introduced to the C programming language and I
found that being able to write codes to develop a software is a great and
unique skill. I found that I was coding very passionately at that time and I
came to the decision that I would spend at least a year to learn programming.
I want to learn it to enhance my skill, to get a job in Information Technology
field and to develop some great software. Without knowing these programming
languages, I will not be able to develop those applications and software.  
  
Though I have learned some basic of C programming language, there are still so
many things that I do not know about programming. As computerisation is a must
in every field of work, I want to prepare myself for this in advance. I need
to learn more about programming to meet the great demands of the application
of the computer.  
  
I have decided to get admitted in a large IT training institute in our city
and I would get enrolled in programming language courses. Besides, I would
invest a great deal of my personal time to practise and would take help from
Internet to become an advanced programmer. Online video tutorials and podcasts
on learning to code would make things easier for me, I believe.  
  
As I have already told, I want to build up my career in Information Technology
related field and without learning those programming languages, it would be
quite impossible for me. I want to develop some great software and make a
great contribution in this field. Honestly I am quite ready to dedicate my
time and effort to achieve this.

###  Tips for talking about this Cue Card Topic:

  
For this cue card you can talk about any skill, subject lesson, technical and
art skill you want to learn in future. The list of things that you may talk
about for this cue card can be:  
  
1\. Plan to learn how to **play a musical instrument** like guitar, drum, and
piano.  
2\. Plan to **get engaged in a professional course** like office management,
programming, graphics design, basic computer course, accounting courses,

9\. Plan to **learn swimming, how to play a game, use a computer software
etc.**  
10\. Plan to **learn human resource management** for your small business or
professional need.

Virtually anything that people usually learn either by himself/ herself or
from someone else, teacher, or training institutes can be described in this
cue card.  
  
If you can’t remember anything that you are going to learn (even what you
desire to learn), present a skill you have as if you are going to learn it.  
  
For the second question “**why you want to learn it**”, mention that you are
very much interested in this and that would add many advantages in your
personal/ professional life. Also mention that you had a great interest in it
for a long time and you have not been able to manage time to actually learn
it. Finally mention some of the advantages people usually enjoy if they have
this skill/ quality that you are planning to learn.  
  
For the third question “**Where and how you will learn it**” mention that you
would wither learn it by yourself with the help of books and internet or you
will get enrolled in a course and learn it. If the skill is an easy one like
learning how to play a game, you can mention that you are going to learn it by
yourself. But if the skill learning requires some professional help, you
should say that you are planning to learn it from a teacher/ of training
institute. Since you are only planning to learn it, you can mention some
possible alternatives where you can get enrolled and learn it. For example: if
you are planning to learn how to play piano you can say:

“Well, I will need to purchase a piano first to learn it and I have decided to
purchase one in the beginning of the next year as I will have some extra money
at that time. Initially I would ask my friend (…say a name…) to help me about
the basic of the piano lesson as s/he is a great piano player I have ever
seen. I will then practice a lot in my free time and would try to get some
help from a piano teacher in our area I know about. Besides, the internet is
going to be very handy resource for me as these short of lessons are available
over internet and I would try to get some help from there as well. Finally, if
my time allows, I will get enrolled in a good piano lesson training institute
which is available in my city. I believe that, learning to play a piano
demands determination and practice and I am positive that I will be fully
devoted to learn it.”  
  
Give a good ending and give a very strong impression that you are passionate
and determined to learn this skill.

  
**Your ability to talk about this cue card topic should empower you to talk about the following cue card topics as well:**  
  
**1\. Describe a skill you have.  
2\. Describe a skill one of your friends has.  
3\. Describe a professional course you have attended.  
4\. Describe a skill you would like to learn.  
5\. Describe a quality or skill you love in your friends.  
6\. Describe a skill which is important for you.**

you-know-once-had&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a pet that you or someone you know once had.

**You should say:**

  * What kind of animal it was
  * What kind of care it needed
  * What you liked/ disliked about it

**and explain why this is a popular type of pet.**

**Sample Answer 1: **  
It is a very long time since I had a pet!  However, when we were small my
sister and I did both have pets, I’m going to tell you all about them.  What
kind of animal, how we looked after them, why we liked them and what makes
them to this day a popular children’s pet.

The animal in question was a guinea pig!  My sister and I had one each, mine
was called Treacle, and her’s was called Toffee.  They were father and son,
Treacle was the older guinea pig and Toffee was a bit younger.  Despite their
name, guinea pigs are neither from Guinea and nor are they related to pigs.
They are rodents, with distinctive front teeth, they are quite small, compact,
rounded creatures, fur covered, with short legs and no tail.  They are also
highly social, I think they come from South America, and ‘naturally’ would
live in groups of up to ten individuals so it is really important they are
kept with others when in captivity or they become very stressed and unhappy.

The guinea pigs lived together in a shared hutch in the garden.  They weren’t
difficult to look after, but they did need a lot of daily care.  First thing
in the morning we would open the hutch and let the guinea pigs out so they
could run around the garden.  They never strayed very far, and kept the lawn
beautifully short, they ate grass in preference to any of the planted flowers.
Whilst they were running round we would clean out the hutch every day.  The
hutch was in two parts, an enclosed sleeping area, and a larger living area
with a wire mesh side.  We would take everything out in the morning and
replace it with new bedding.  First a layer of sawdust and then newspaper
covered by lots of soft fresh hay in the sleeping area so it was warm and
cosy.Then in the living area we would scatter a deep layer of sawdust before
putting out fresh food, a mixture of vegetables – carrots and cabbage,
together with a special guinea pig food we brought from the pet food shop
which contained grains like crushed maize as well as grass pellets.   They
also had a water bottle hanging up which we filled up freshly each day.  The
guinea pigs spent all day in the garden, but as evening fell they would put
themselves to bed in their hutch.  Last thing at night we would check they
were safe and well, and lock them in and pull a cover down over the front of
the hutch.  This kept them warm and dry evenif the weather was bad and
protected them in case foxes might visit at night.

I loved my guinea pig.  He was a beautiful warm chestnut colour.  He had sort
of rosette shapes in his coat – not like smooth haired guinea pigs which I
think are more usual today.  I liked to cuddle him, which he tolerated, but
honestly when I look back I don’t know if he really enjoyed it as much as I
did. Poor Treacle.  He and his brother Toffee were very talkative.  They made
a delightful squeaking and chattering noise when they were excited – for
example when they could hear you were on your way over to feed them.

Guinea pigs are really good pets I think.  They are gentle and not too
difficult to look after.  However, it’s really important they have
companionship of the same species, a proper diet, fresh food and water every
day and lots of room to move about.  They are incredibly active, running
around for about 20 hours each day.  Having a pet is a big responsibility, but
I think I learned a lot from looking after our guinea pigs.  You have to care
for them every day, and that is an important lesson for a child to learn.
Sadly, in time they grew old and died.  We were very upset, but that was
perhaps a useful life lesson too.  I gained a lot from my friendship with
Treacle, but even so I worry about animals being kept as pets, they are not
all looked after as well as they should be.  If children are given pets, I
think it’s really important they know how to care for them properly and that
an adult is around to supervise, then everyone can be satisfied that the
animal is safe and well and that the children and  pets are both as happy as
each other!

**Model Answer 2:**  
My uncle had a dog almost 10 years ago and we called it Dave. We stayed at our
uncle's house for about 6 months at that time and I often played with Dave.
This dog was around 2 years old and very fond of us. We used to feed him and
that's why he became so close to us. My uncle placed it at a pet training
centre when it was 1 years old. So he was a dog who needed a little care. We
used to bath him 3-4 times a week. He was very choosy about his sleeping place
and we needed to make him a cozy dog room. When he became sick, we needed to
take him to the nearest pet hospital. We used to belt him sometimes when we
took him to unknown places. Mostly keeping him clean and dry was the care he
needed most.  
  
I liked the pet very much mostly because the way he treated us. Whenever I
returned home he came to me and acted so fondly. It seemed like he understood
my moods and gestures and acted accordingly. I liked the pet because he was a
good accompany.

###

  * The name of the nation.
  * The country they live in.
  * If this is a nation from past, specifically mention it.
  * Give some details about the famous and distinctive achievement and characteristics of this nation.

  
Now mention that you have learned about this nation from history books,
magazines, TV programs, News channels, Internet and from your teachers. You

dissatisfied-about&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  A product you bought and was dissatisfied about.

**You should say:**

  *  What was the product?
  *  From where did you buy it?
  *  What was not satisfying?

**And explain what you did about the product.**

**Model Answer:**  
It would be probably 1 year or so when I bought a cell phone and went through
a horrible experience. I bought Nokia C5 cell phone from a Nokia shop of the
city shopping mall. I saved the amount to purchase a cell phone over 6 months
that would allow me to use internet and install applications. Due to my budget
deficiency I though Nokia C5 would be a good choice and the salesman also
convinced me to purchase this particular one. I spent almost half an hour to
test the phone before purchasing it.  
  
I used the cell phone for about a month and I was very happy of its
performance. It was touch phone and mostly operated with fingertip. All of a
sudden one day I noticed that the touch functionality is not working and hence
I am unable to use it and do anything. I restarted the phone and I found it
okay again. But that problem kept reappearing over and over again and I took
the phone to the service center. After a week I took back it home and used
smoothly for 2 weeks or so and sadly the problem reappeared. That was a very
frustrating experience and I explained my daunting experience to the customer
care officer and he assured that they would fix it. But to my surprise I found
the problem again. That day I decided to through it in the dustbin and bought
a new cell phone by a different brand and manufacturer. Though I have not
threw it away to the dustbin, I placed it in a box with old and unused
materials. I later bought a new cell phone by Sony and found it really cool.

###  Tips for talking about this cue card topic:

For this cue card speaking topic, you should talk about a product that you
bought and was very disappointed about. Mention a product that you bought and
mention your expectation from this product and the brand. Then show your
disappointment about your experience of this product and finally mention why

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a teacher from your past who you remember

**You should say:**

  * What class the teacher taught you
  * What subject did he teach
  * How old were you and why do you remember him/ her
  * What are special characteristics of the teacher

**and explain why do you like him.**

**Possible Answer:**  
Throughout my academic life, I found and came in to contact with several
teachers whom I'll never forget mostly because of their personality and
quality teaching. Such a teacher who I remember clearly was Mr. Aurther who
taught us History at our 8th grade. I was then about 13-14 years old and was
in class Eight. He had an admiring personality and a different way of
teaching. He was very punctual and honest and inspired us to be so. He never
pressurized us on studying and always told us stories on different historical
events. In his classes we never felt bored. He had a gift of making the
lessons interesting and attracting students to his stories. Much of the
history I now know is because of him.

My major was Science and I have not studied history that much but whatever
interest I grew on history was mostly his contribution. I can still recall the
stories I heard from him. He never misbehaved with any of his students and all
of his students admired him very much. I learned later on that he was an
honest and benevolent man in his personal life. I still remember him because
he was a good man, a wise mentor and a nice person who taught us things that
we still remember.

###  
Tips for answering this cue card topic:

Mention that the teacher was very influential and you consider him/ her to be
one of the greatest teachers you have ever got. Start by saying the teacher’s
name and the class and subject s/he taught. Mention your age at the time when
s/he taught you and give details of his/her personality, way of teaching and
other details. Not necessarily the teacher has to be an academic teacher; s/he
can be a private tutor as well for this cue card.  
  
Two important aspects you must cleverly cover in this cue card: describing the
attractive characteristics and good qualities of this teacher and then your
reason for remembering his/her. Since the cue card asks you to describe a
teacher from your past, so not talk about a teacher who still teaches you in
any way.  
Following are some of the tips to help you generate some points to talk about
the good qualities the teacher had and the reason why you still remember it.
Add your own idea and points with the clues provided below:  
  
**Characters:**  
1.    S/he was a good teacher who always inspired the students to study
attentively.  
2.    S/he had a moral and amiable character and because of that most of the
teachers and students liked him/her.  
3.    The way s/he taught us was really great as it was interesting and s/he
had a way of explaining the subject matter very attractively.  
4.    S/he has a natural talent of telling story and then relating the story
to the topic s/he taught.  
5.    S/he was punctual and always inspired us to value the time.  
6.    S/he helped the students in need and I have never found him/her turning
down someone who sought help from him/her.

  
**Why I remember him/her:**  
There are several reasons I still remember him/her and the main reason among
those is his/her amiable personality. I have never found him/her lost his/her
temper no matter what. S/he was a good person by heart and took his/ her
teaching profession very professionally. S/he always listened to us
attentively even and then gave his/ her opinion. I have never found him/her in
angry mode and I was very much amazed with the fatherly/ motherly behaviours
s/he had.  
Apart from the good personality, s/he was a good teacher who knew how to
explain a topic. His/her way of teaching was very interesting and I never felt
bored in his/her classes. I can still recall the stories s/he told and then
related those stories to the main study topics. In my opinion s/he was on the
best teacher in my life and I am very much curious to learn more about him/her
and would like to meet him/her to know about the things s/he is doing now.

sample%2F703-describe-a-difficult-thing-you-did-
well&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a difficult thing you did well.

**You should say:**

  * what it was
  * how you did it
  *  why (or how) it was difficult

**and explain how you felt after you did it.**

**Follow-up Questions: **

  * Have other people (you know) had this success?
  * Did people congratulate you for doing this?
  * What are the main reason people fails to reach the target.

**Model Answer:**  
In our lives we do so many difficult things knowingly and unknowingly. For
some difficult tasks we get appreciation and some remain unnoticed by others.

I would like to describe one of the difficult jobs I did and was appreciated
as well. It was an event when I was around 18 years old and saved a little boy
who was drowning in a pond. That day I was near a big pond of our town and all
of a sudden I noticed a human hand in the water. No other part of the little
boy's body could be seen except his hand that he was desperately trying to get
up at the last moment of his life. Initially I thought that I was just
hallucinating and nothing was in the water but instantly I changed my mind and
had been sure that it was a boy who was drowning. I took off my shoes and
jumped in to the water. Then I realized my mistake that I have not pointed out
the exact place where I thought someone was sinking.

I desperately swam and went to the approximate place after I struggled for few
minutes. But there was none to be found. I started feeling very helpless and
found some people were looking at me with curious look. I shouted that I saw a
boy was drowning and trying to save him. I found 2-3 others also get in to the
water to find the boy. I felt overwhelmed with the urge to find the boy. All
of a sudden I saw the flash on water and quickly reached there. I felt someone
who I had felt with my body and I tried to pull out him from the water. But to
my surprise it seems impossible to me to pull out the boy from water.  


I used all of my force, energy and determination and will to get the boy from
the water. I had to struggle a lot and I was sure how long it took me to bring
him up. To me it seemed like eternity and finally I had been able to grab the
boy firmly and swam towards the land. I was worried because the boy had
already lost his conscience and I tried my best to help him breath. I pulled
down and up my hands very strongly over his chest and finally he coughed. I
felt very tired and yet happy that the boy was out of danger. Some people came
to extend their helping hands and they took the boy to the nearby hospital. I
went to the hospital and returned home when the boy was completely safe.  


I felt real proud to be able to save the boy and the gratefulness I saw in the
boy's parents is something I will never forget. People appreciated my bravery
and efforts and I also felt very relieved and proud.

heard&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Tell a childhood story you heard when you were a kid.

**You should say:**

  * Who told you the story
  * what was the story
  * Why you liked it

**and explain why you have remember the story.**

**Possible Answer: **  
Childhood stories were fascinating and in my childhood I had been very fond of
those short of stories. My grandmother used to tell me stories before going to
sleep. One such childhood story that I can remember is about a prince who
fought and defeated a mighty giant to rescue his princess.

He was a good prince who helped his countrymen and was a very good fighter. He
was happily married with the prince he fall in love with. They were benevolent
kings and queens for the country and people of the country loved them very
much. One day a giant ghost came from other territory and tried to abduct a
small kid. The prince was out of the country at that moment for business
purpose and the queen tried to force the giant to leave. That irritated the
giant and it finally abducted the queen. The prince returned to the country
few days back and learned the stories. He became very gloomy and decided to
search for his queen. Everybody tried to protest him but he finally remain
steady on his decision. He started a long and struggle-some journey to find
the giant and rescue the queen. The journey was much surprising and full of
different puzzles and obstacles. He finally reached to the abyss and found the
queen. He had to fight with the giant and finally kill it to get his princess
back.

As a kid this was one of my very favourite stories. My grandma told me the
story multiple times and I used to insist her to tell me this very story. As a
kid the story opened new horizon to me. I believed that every word of this
story was true and that's why it made a special place in my mind. Most
probably I have thought a lot about the things happened in this story and as a
result I have still remembered the story.

**Alternative Answer:**  
My mother used to tell me bed-time stories in my childhood and I have heard
some of those stories so many times they have been permanently depicted in my
memory.  
  
One such story was the story of a boy who was 10 years old and got lost one
day. The boy tried to get back home but since a bad magician used his black
magic on the boy, he could not get back to home. The boy would be totally lost
once the magic engulf him totally and the magician would then use the boy to
do bad things. But in the boy's memory was his mother and father and that's
why he was not totally lost. The boy continue his search for the way back to
his home and on this journey he met an old man, a wounded tiger, a candy man,
a king and a nomad with gold coins. Each time the boy met someone many
exciting things happened. In fact those were the tests for him. If he passes
those tests would be able to get back home and if he fails the tests, he would
never be able to get back home. His confront with the king was most exciting
as he had to go to different places and collect different things from
challenging places to prove that he was innocent. Each time the boy faced a
new challenge and amazing circumstances, the story gets more exciting.  
  
After the boy won the last challenge he was given, the impact of the magic was
no longer applicable and he found that he was standing nearby his home. As a
kid I really enjoyed the story. I was almost the same age the boy in the story
was and every time he faced a new challenge, the story took a turn and
revealed another challenges. The story was intelligently made and I loved to
hear it.



###  Tips for answering this Cue card topic:

Remember any story suitable for a child or may be a real story you heard from
your childhood and prepare for the quick notes that you should take before you
start talking about this cue card. Adhere to the questions asked in the cue
card question and take quick notes on that. After you are done taking short
notes to each question, try to elaborate each answer with additional
information. For instance following is an approach of note taking for the
questions and later on the elaborate method is shown.

  
\-- My grandmother.  
\-- It was about a boy who was taken to the underworld by a witch.  
\-- The story was great; I was amazed by the underworld, my grandmother made
it interesting for me.  
\--  I heard  it several times, I told it to my younger kids, I dreamed about
this story and that was a story I will never forget.

  
After you have taken short notes for each question, it is time to elaborate
this. Following is an example of how to elaborate each point taken earlier.

  
\--  My grandmother used to tell me stories to help me sleep and this was the
story I heard from her more than hundred times. She had a great way of telling
a story, specially the fairy stories and her tones and expressions made the
story more interesting. She told it so convincingly that sometimes I believed
that the characters and story were true. I was only 6-7 years old when I heard
it and then it became my favourite bedtime story.  
  
\-- It was a story about a boy who was barely 8-9 years old and who was
abducted by a witch one day while he was playing in the field. The witch took
the boy to complete one of her very wicked ambition to become immortal and the
boy was meant to be killed by her. But the boy was so brave and he loved his
mother very much. The father was a warrior and started his voyage to rescue
his son. In the man time a lovely fairy found the plot of the witch and she
was determined to rescue the boy. The boy with his bravery, with the help of
the good fairy and finally for the unforgettable battle between the father and
the witch the bot was rescued and the witch and the evil spirit was killed.  
  
\-- I liked it because of the story line and the way my grandma told me the
stories. I was touched by the bravery or the boy and his father and at the
same time this was my first imagination about a world placed underground.
There were lots of materials in the story, imaginary materials actually, and
those helped me to imagine about a world that I never knew. I started dreaming
about the underworld and the evil spirit and good spirit of the story and I
was also very inspired by the bravery of the young child of the story. For all
those reasons I liked the story very much and I always required my grandma to
tell this very story. Because I have heard this story several times, naturally
it became the part of my memory. It was one of my very favourite stories in my
childhood and later on I have told this story to some of my younger cousins.
Most importantly, in my childhood I have made lots of imaginary things
regarding this story and that made a strong impression on me. Because of that
I still remember this story.  
  
After you have told the story and answered the question, give a finishing line
to your speaking and that would make your speaking a very good one.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 74 - Describe an irritating neighbour of your
locality

sample%2F691-ielts-cue-card-sample-74-describe-an-irritating-neighbour-of-
your-locality&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an irritating neighbour of your locality.

**You should say:**

  * For how long the person has been your neighbour
  * How this person behave with others
  * Explain how annoying the person is.

**and explain what can be done to reduce his annoying activities.**

**Model Answer: **  
Most of our neighbours are amiable and well-behaved and they are good
neighbours except Mr. Deun who seems very irritating to me. He is living in
our community for about 3 years after he bought the house from the previous
owner. So he is our neighbour for the last three years and shortly after he
started living here people started noticing his annoying behaviours.

He is a retired person who has only 4 family members and though other family
members are well-behaved, this person has some issues that make him a bad
neighbour. He does not behave politely and often we find him rude with others.
He often shouts on very silly issues. Even with kids he behaves rudely.  


He often complaints about people standing in front of his house while it is a
street and people stand there for a while to look for an auto. In my opinion
he has no right to yell with the neighbours who play in the nearby playground.
He does not go out very often and stays at his home most of the time. But he
complaints about everything, about everyone. Since he has complaints on other
people, he should have followed the strict rules not to disturb others but in
reality he does the opposite. He sometimes shouts with his family members that
other people can hear and that's very disturbing especially in the middle of
the night.  


I remember him scolding a 10 years girl who mistakenly entered in his garden
and just enjoyed the flowers. She did nothing and Mr. Deun acted very
impolitely with her. People in our locality sometimes make fun of him for his
behaviours and usually avoids him from social gathering. He has a habit of
advising people while he does not listen to anybody's request. Thus I find him
very annoying.  


I am not sure what to do to reduce his annoyance but I guess we should talk to
him very politely and try to make peace with him. He is not a type of person
who would yield to logic or good intension. So if he does not heed to polite
conversation, the local senior persons can sit with him to short out the
problem. His family members can contribute to make him understand that the way
he behaves with others are not acceptable and is not a good sign. Finally if
nothing can be done to change him, we should avoid him and ignore his
disturbance. He is not a kid whom we can teach the basic of mannerism and
social responsibilities. So in my opinion a polite discussion can be effective
and if not there is nothing we can do to change his behaviours.  


###  Tips for talking about this Cue Card topic:

While talking about an irritating neighbour, first mention that why this
person is irritating. Be careful about the fact that mentioning your
abhorrence about the irritating neighbour would only be reasonable when you
can establish the fact that s/he is really irritating.  
  
Do not say that you know this annoying neighbor only for few days. That would
give a shallow judgment about someone. Mention that you know this person for a
long time and not only you but other people in your neighbourhood also abhor
him/ her for the annoying activities s/he does often.  
  
You would be convincing if you mention that the person does not obey the rules
and regulation of your community, often make disturbing attitude with others;
especially with kids and senior citizens, shouts very loudly and makes
quarrels loudly.  
  
Now give some of your personal experiences regarding this people and that
should be convincing why you have started feeling that he/she is an annoying
person.

  
**Some of the attitude/ activities that you can mention while describing this annoying neighbour of yours:**  
  
1\. S/he is always shouts and does not show respect to others.  
2\. Often listen to music very loudly that annoys people who live around.  
3\. Often makes quarrels and does not obey the rules people usually follow in
your community.  
4\. Throws away trashes to other people’s yard.  
5\. Often get drunk and does make scenes in public.  
6\. Often bits the pets of other people.  
7\. Does not show respect and love to children and elderly people.  
  
For the last question “and explain what can be done to reduce his annoying
activities” mention that, though s/he is irritating you still respect him/her
and believe that s/he has a reason for the way s/he behaves. Proper
counselling, advice and friendly behaviours might help him. Also mention that
people in your locality should talk to his/ her family members to learn what
makes this person annoyed and then you should try your best not to do that.
Try to be very reasonable and understanding in this part to show your goodwill

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a trip you have taken recently.

**You should say:**

  * Where you went
  * Who went with you
  * Why you went there

**and describe some things you saw and did on your trip. **

**Possible Answer:**  
Few days back we went to (_...tell a name of a place that you would like to
talk about..._) in an official trip. This trip was arranged by our office and
all of our colleagues and some of their relatives went there. As it was an
official tour and I had been thinking about going to such a trip, I agreed to
go. The place was a good picnic spot and historically important. I have had
plans to visit the place and when I heard that an official tour has been
arranged there, I simply agreed to go to the trip without giving any second
thought.  
  
On the trip day all of the participants met at our office ground and took our
seats on the bus. It was about 3-4 hours journey and at 11:30 am we reached at
the spot. We visited the small museum there, took bath in a pond, ran through
the narrow roads and bridged, climbed at small hills, played cricket, took
photos, took our meals, arranged a singing competition, raffle draw program
and many more interesting things there. We saw historical significance and
documentary on a wide screen projector arranged by the governing authority of
the place, we visited a small museum, and we saw fishes in the rivers, birds
on the trees and many eye catching sceneries there. We stayed there whole day
and returned home after the evening. That was a good trip that I really
enjoyed.

###  Tips for talking about this Cue Card Question:

For this cue card you can talk about a trip you remember. Since this question
requires you to talk about a trip you recently had, you must mention that you
had this trip only few days back. Even if you talk about a trip that you
actually had few years back, you should describe it as if you recently
returned from this trip.  
  
First mention the place where you went for this trip. Then describe what type
of trip it was and who was with you in this trip. While mentioning the place,
it is advisable to mention the city/ place name and then name the country,
location is such a way so that someone who does not know about this place can
guess where it might be.  
If it was a family trip, mention who went with you. Similarly if this was a
trip with friends or colleagues, you should very clearly mention this.  
  
For the next question, mention what was the reason you wanted to have this
trip. Mention whether it was a recreational trip, family trip, official/
business trip of something else. Give some background of the planning and
preparation for the tip and finally mention your experience during this trip.  
  
Try to give an interesting description of your journey, staying, activities,
sightseeing and other experiences to make it an attractive tour. Also mention
what you learned from this trip and why you enjoyed it.  
  
Since the final question particularly asks you to talk about the things you
did and saw in the trip, try to mention some of the following things and
activities about your trip:  
  
1\. Visit to a museum.  
2\. Visit to an interesting historic place  
3\. Visit to a royal and famous place  
4\. Suring  
5\. Scuba diving  
6\. Attending local festivals  
7\. Watching theatrical performance and other art shows.  
8\. Trip to a local place.  
9\. Hiking  
10\. Skating  
11\. Skiing  
12\. Swimming  
13\. Testing local cuisine  etc.

You shoud add the things you watched or things you did in your trip apart from
the ideas mentioned above.

Describing your trip in an interesting was is more important that mentioning
so many activities or things worth seeing for this cue card. To get a really
good score, describe the trip in such a way that it creates interest to the
listener to have a trip there too.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What are some famous tourist spots in your country?

Q. What are the positive impacts of tourism in your country?

Q. What are the negative impacts of tourism in your country?

Q. What do you think are the reasons people visit new places?

Q. What can you tell about the future of tourism industry in your country?

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 69 - Describe a holiday that you have recently
celebrated

sample%2F679-ielts-cue-card-sample-69-describe-a-holiday-that-you-have-
recently-celebrated&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a holiday that you have recently celebrated.

**You should say:**

  * What holiday it was
  * How did you celebrated
  * What did you do

**and describe why this holiday is important to you.**  


**Possible Answer:**  
A recent holiday that I celebrated was the Eid-ul-Fitr few months back. Eid-
ul-Fitr is one of the major festival and holiday for Muslims. I celebrated it
with my parents and siblings in my home town. I had 4 days off for the
occasion and I was in my home town in those days. Before the Eid day, I did
some shopping for my family members and relatives. In Eid day I wake up early
in the morning, took a shower and went to the Mosque to say my prayer. We wore
new clothes on the day and had several delicious menus cooked at home. We went
to visit some of our neighbors and relatives in the evening and spent a great
day with joy and happiness.

This Eid day is very significant for Muslims and they celebrate with great joy
and religious norm. For me this is religiously important and I can be with my
family members on this occasion.

**Alternative Answer:**  
Recently I got a holiday for about 4-5 days based on our office holiday
calendar on occasion of the Christmas and I really enjoyed during this
holiday. After scheduled work and several deadlines, this was a mush desired
and deserved holiday for me and I went to visit my hometown during those days.
I asked one of my very close friends to visit my hometown and he was excited
to travel with me. After we reached our hometown, I made a plan to introduce
the life and custom of our hometown to my friends and we visited almost more
than 5 famous places in our locality.  
  
On the third day we had a family and friends picnic and we had this picnic in
the garden of our home. That was really enjoyable as I had been with the
friends and family members I really care about. I and my friends watched some
new movies in my laptop and we watched movies almost every night.  
  
This was an important holiday because I needed a break after a series of hard
work in the office. Meeting 5-6 deadlines month after month was bit stressful
for me and I was eagerly waiting for this holidays. In terms of refreshment,
relief and enjoyment this was one of the best holidays ever for me.

###  Tips for Answering this Cue Card Topic:

Some IELTS candidate would be confused just after reading the topic of this
cue card and would try to find out what holiday s/he should talk about and if
this is really a holiday. Just be assured that the topic has not asked you to
talk about a national / religious or widely celebrated holiday. So you are
free to talk about any sort of holiday you want. Since, people know well about
the major celebration and widely celebrated holidays, it is in fact a good
idea to talk about such a holiday. But keep in mind that since the question
asks you to talk about your celebration of a recent holiday, talking about a
holiday you had 10 months earlier might seems bit unusual to the examiner, of
course if this is not the real case for you!  
  
Holiday can be a calendar day that is celebrated by people, does not matter if
this is a tribe specific celebration or a widely celebrated holiday like New
Year eve, Christmas or Eid. Holiday is slightly different from the weekly day-
offs and you should not talk about your celebration on a day off.  
  
Mention a holiday, the purpose and what you did during this holiday for this
cue card. Even the summer holidays declared by the university for the students
that you can talk about as well.  
  
Since the first question of this topic asks you to mention ‘what holiday it
was’, you are expected to give a clear and concise definition of the holiday
you would like to talk about. Keep in mind that, the holiday might be for one
day and can be multiple days as well. So you should not restrict yourself to a
holiday which lasts for one day.  
The second and third questions are pretty similar and you can answer these two
questions at a time. Just mention your activities during this holiday and do
not make it dull by saying that you have been at home all days and watched
movies or played game while eating pizza! The examiner would be expecting you
to give an exciting and memorable holiday celebration. Unless you are a gifted
speaker, talk about some interesting things, activities and unusual things you
did during this period to make your speaking more interesting.  
  
The final question of this cue card is bit tricky as it asks you to give your
opinion rather than describing events; you should actually be god at this
part. Like any other good presentation, a god ending in a cue card speaking
part would ensure a better score in speaking part.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What is the concept of holiday in your country?

Q. Why is holiday so important to modern people?

Q. Do you think it is necessary to observe the traditional customs?

Q. What changes in terms of spending festivals and holidays have taken place
in the past decade?

Q. What is the difference as regards celebration in different part of the
country?

Q. In your opinion should we spend holidays as we like or according to the
tradition?  
  
**You should be able to answer the following cue card topics if you prepare for this topic:  **  
  
**1.  Describe a celebration you recently enjoyed.  
2.  Describe a trip you recently had.  
3.  Describe a national festival in your country.  
4.  Describe a journey you recently had.  
5.  Describe how you usually celebrate your holidays.  
6.  Describe the common activities of people in your country during the
holidays.**

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 83 - Talk about a peaceful place that you like

sample%2F707-ielts-cue-card-sample-83-talk-about-a-peaceful-place-that-you-
like&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a peaceful place that you like.

**You should say:**

  * Where is the place located?
  * What is this place?
  * How did you come to know about the place?

**and explain why do you like that place.**

**Model Answer:**  
My grandfather's house is a peaceful place that I visit around 2-3 times a
year and like very much. This is in the village (...say a village name...). My
grandfather’s house is a big house with lots of open spaces and a river is
flowing nearby.  
  
In this big house only 3-4 people and 2-3 servants live as my grandparents are
no longer in this world and my uncles, aunts are mostly living in different
big cities.  
There are 7-8 rooms in the house and a big garden in front of the house. The
servants take care of the garden and keep the place neat and clean. Since I
live in a city and work for a big company where I have lots of
responsibilities to perform, the city life seems very busy and even sometimes
chaotic to me.  
  
Whenever I visit my grandfather’s house, I get an impression that I have come
to the most peaceful place in the world. I have not seen many places and have
not travelled extensively but in my experience the peace and mental
tranquility I enjoy being here is unmatched. One of the reasons can be my
childhood memories; as I have spent my childhood at this very house and
whenever I go there, lots of memories flash back and give me a pleasure that I
do not get from elsewhere.  
  
I know this place from my childhood as I was born and grown up here. This
place is different to me. I leave behind my busy life and come here to relax
both mentally and physically. The memory of my departed grandparents, my
childhood and other happy events are related to this place. I can get fresh
air, meet some of my relatives, enjoy the country life and stay close to
nature here and for all those reasons, I like this place very much.

**If you can answer this Cue Card topic, you should be able to answer the following Cue Card topics as well:**

  1. **Describe a place you like to go often.**
  2. **Describe a beautiful place you have visited.**
  3. **Describe a place where you often visit.**
  4. **Describe a beautiful place near your home.**
  5. **Describe a worth visiting place in your hometown.**
  6. **Describe a naturally beautiful place.**
  7. **Describe an open space where people often visit.**
  8. **Describe a place where you often go in the evening.**
  9. **Describe a place worth visiting.**
  10. **Describe a place near water or forest.   **

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 94 - Describe a TV program

sample%2F751-ielts-cue-card-sample-94-describe-a-tv-
program&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a TV program which has made a strong impression on you.

**You should say:**

  * what kind of  TV program it was, e.g. comedy, romantic
  * when you saw the TV program.
  * what the TV program was about.

**and explain why this TV program made such an impression on you.**

**Model Answer 1:**  
I do not watch TV that often nowadays but when I was a student, I used to
watch televisions a lot. There are lots of programs that really liked and
watched regularly. In those days I watch mostly news and some selective TV
programs. The TV program that made a strong impression on me was a documentary
that I watched on Discovery Channel.

The TV program was called “The sacrifice of genius” and it was a serial that
had around 10 episodes. I watched all of those episodes and enjoyed a lot.
This was mainly a documentary serial which emphasized the sacrifice the famous
and genius scientists like Marie Curie, Thomas Edison and 8 other scientists.  
  
I watched the TV program in my third year of my graduation program. In our
local time, the program was broadcasted at 9.00 pm every Thursday. The program
showed the life and work of the famous scientists and the sacrifices they made
for humans and to make the world a better place. These stories were presented
in a fascinating way and were very professionally made. The spectators would
have the impression that they were actually watching the real scientists and
their works.  
  
I have learned so many things about those scientists and learned the
sacrifices they made. Those sacrifices were unbelievable and after watching
this program, I could not stop thinking about those famous scientist and their
supreme sacrifices. This program has helped me thinking in a different
perspective that sacrifices for others can be more important than personal
achievements like wealth, fame and self-awareness. I later searched about
details of those scientists and other famous persons as well and learned many
things. I was actually inspired by this program and started learning closely
about the people who made the world a place where we no longer need to live in
the dark and do not have to fight the wild animals to earn our foods.

**Model Answer 2: **

My favorite television program is an old television series which was produced
during the 80’s in America. The title of the film was MacGyver and it was an
action TV series. MacGyver was produced for about 5 consecutive seasons, and
it was considered as one of the top rated TV serials in its era.

RCTI was the local television station in Indonesia that broadcasted the
programme. The TV series was usually played once a week for about one hour,
and I remember that it was played on Friday Night at 7.00 pm. So as a teenager
during that time, I would have sat in front of the television from 6.45 pm and
waiting for the programme to start. On the next day, my friends and I would
discuss about what happened in it, to talk about how cool and exciting the
episode was and how smart and talented the MacGyver was.

The unique thing about it is that the main character, Mac Gyver did not like
to use gun as his weapon.  Instead of using riffles, he used his creativity in
creating tools to fight his enemies. I remembered that in one of the episodes,
where he was locked by his enemy in a garage. But then with his creative
thinking, he found some tools that could be used to open the gate of the
garage, and he could escape from his enemy.  I believe that we could learn
some positive things from this series. We learned that we should avoid using
guns, and we should also be encouraged to use our creativity. I believe that
MacGyver had influenced so many teenagers during my era and I hoped that it
could be remake in the future.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a funny incident that happened to you.

**You should say:**

  *  What it was
  * Why  it was funny
  * Who was there with you

**and what you remember most about it.**

**Model Answer:**  
The funny incident that I remember happened was almost 2-3 years ago that I
would like to describe.

That time I was a student of university and I was in my 7th semester. We had a
group assignment and to collect data we went to some libraries after our
class. In the evening, I found that my group members are complaining that they
are hungry and they need to have some foods.

I found them entering in a restaurant and I went with them. One of my
classmates ordered some foods directly to the waiter without looking at the
menu and after we are done with our foods, I noticed that one of the group
mates is asking the group leader to pay the bill. The group leader was
astonished as he had not offered the meal and said that he did not have the
money to pay the bill. I asked the waiter to bring the bill and we were
thundered to look at the amount. It was much higher than the usual price.
Though we were bit worried, but we started laughing and enjoying the whole
thing. One of the classmates offered to collect all of our money and then pay
the bill. We looked at our wallets, pockets &amp; bags and collected the whole
amount. There were so many changes and coins there that we had to calculate
2-3 times. But to our surprise the total amount is still not sufficient to pay
the bill.

We started laughing and I proposed 2 of the group mates to give their cell
phone and wrist watched as the alternative of the bill. These two group mates
got serious and were protesting that these would be an insane idea. Rest of us
started enjoying their reaction as we found that they have actually taken this
seriously.  One of your group mates proposed that we should pay the amount we
have with us and ask the manager of the hotel to allow us time to pay the rest
of the amount. I told them that manager would not allow that and would call
for police! We enjoyed the event, the dubious looks on some of your classmates
and the fact that 2-3 of them have taken the whole thing very seriously and
are actually got anxious.

We stayed there for about 1 hours and notices that people around us were
giving surprising looks as we something very funny and interesting is going on
among us. One of my group mates' house was nearby and he proposed that he
would go home and bring the money and in the mean time we would stay there
until he arrives. We agreed and waited for him another20 minutes or so. In the
meantime one of the boys told that the classmates who left won’t come back! We
laughed at the idea and acted as if it's going to happen for real.  After our
classmates returned from home, he paid the bill (with some tips as well!) and
then we left the restaurant.

We then left for our home and I took a taxi and paid the taxi fare from my
home. I told the story to other classmates next day and they found it very
funny and interesting as well. This event became famous in our class and we
often mentioned the funny things happened that day among us.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

Following are some of the funny incidence that you can talk about:  
  
1.    Attending in a party of total strangers.

story in such a way so that the questions with the cue cards are covered.
Start your speaking by saying what the funny event was and when it happened.
Where you were then and what the funny part of this event should come next.

had&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe the best holiday you ever had.

**You should say:**

  * When &amp; where you had it
  * How you reached there
  * What you did and with whom

**and explain why it's so special.**

**Model Answer:**  
The best holiday in my life was the holiday I had with my parents and sisters
2/3 years back. I work in the capital city and visit my hometown 3-4 times in
a year. That time I got a week’s holiday and I planned to give surprise to my
family members. I reached home at around 1.00 am and my parents and siblings
were very happy and surprised. They became even happier when they heard that I
have got a vacation for 7 days. My mother next day called my elder sister who
came to visit us that day with her kids.  
  
The next day we went to watch a movie in the theatre and we ate our dinner in
a Thai restaurant. We return home at late night and then played some indoor
games.  
Next day we went to a nearby picnic spot and that was a very pleasant
experience. We cooked our food and to our surprise, that was delicious. We
played outdoor games, ran in the fields and swam in the water. This was a
truly great day that I enjoyed.  
  
Since my vacation was getting over, my parents planned to visit our
grandparents’ house. Though our grandparents are not alive, still we cherish
the place and enjoy our stay there. In the next morning we started our journey
in our automobiles. It was bit tough to get all of the family members in the
car yet we did that. There were total 9 people in this medium size car.  
  
In the evening we reached at our grandparents’ house where only one of my
uncles and his family members live. We went to visit the nearby river and
enjoyed the open and fresh air. In the evening we returned home and had our
dinner together. Our 2 days’ stay there passed very pleasantly and quickly. I
returned to our own home and the next day I returned to the city. This
holidays I had is a memorable one as I get very little chance to meet and
spend time with all of my family members at a time.

city

your-city&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe the environmental pollution in your city.

**You should say:**

  * What type of pollution it is/ are
  * Cause and effect of pollution
  * Why it had happen

**and explain how can this pollution be controlled.**

**Model Answer:**  
I live in (..say the name of your city..) and this city has got some several
issues related to environmental pollution. The major environmental pollutions
that this city has are water pollution, air pollution and sound pollution.  
  
The main reason for these pollutions is the large number of population and the
industrialization of this city. The city has more than (…say the current
population of this city..) whereas the number should have been far less than
that. It is evitable that a large number of populations in a small city always
cause environmental pollution as they use more cars, consume more energy and
natural resources and create more wastages ad noises.  
  
The reason for the water pollution is the uncontrolled number of industries,
factories and other constructions that have been grown up besides the rivers.
These factories and industries produce a large number of chemical and other
wastages which directly affects the water. Inappropriate and uncontrolled
construction is another reason for water pollution in our city. The effect of
water pollution is severe, the water supply would be affected and the supply
of safe and clean water would be threatened. A large number of people rely on
the water available of the rivers and they would be directly affected. Lots of
people would get sick due to water pollution and those diseases can become
epidemic if not controlled and cause an immense loss of life.  
  
Air pollution is also very concerning in this city and the chemical smoke,
carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide omitted from automobiles and industries are
the main reason for air pollution. This city has more than million automobiles
and thousands of industries which are omitting the dangerous gases, and
ingredients which are causing the air pollutions.  Air pollution is the direct
reason people suffer from various dangerous diseases including lung cancer,
asthma, heart disease etc. In fact the number of people currently suffering
from these diseases in alarming and if steps are not taken to prevent air
pollution immediately, this number would rapidly increase.  
  
Sound pollution is produced by the loud horns used by the cars, loud sound
used for announcement and cacophony created due to loud sound. The airplanes
that fly over the resident area created a very loud noise as well. Air
pollution is a silent killer that causes lots of serious diseases including
hearing and brain cancer. The air pollution directly affects the natural
balance by affecting the wild lives.  
  
The most important thing to reduce pollution in our city is to create public
awareness. We are mostly creating that pollution and endangering ourselves,
the nature and other species. Without our awareness and strict determination
to prevent our city from pollution, we can’t reduce or prevent it. Strict laws
should be introduced and applied against environmental pollution and all the
illegitimate industries and companies should be banned. The decentralization
of industries and offices can be effective as it would reduce the number of
people currently living in this city.  
  
Job opportunities and other facilities should be improved in the rural areas
so that people can manage works in their own cities and villages other than
coming to this city. The education and morality are two important aspects that
help people understand the necessity of keeping the city clean and healthy.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. Is water pollution a problem in your country?

Q. What are some of the causes of water pollution?

Q. What can individuals do to try and ensure water is kept clean?

Q. Do you think problems with the cleanliness of water will improve in the
future?

Q. What can an individual do to reduce the pollution in your city?

Q. How pollution can affect the biodiversity of our environment?

###  Similar Cue Card topics:

Your ability to talk about this Cue Card Topic would enable you to talk about
the following Cue Card Topics as well:

**1\. Describe a problem that you face your city.  
2\. Describe a pollution that causes a great problem in your city.  
3\. Describe a city you know that has air pollution.  
4\. Describe something you would like to change in your city.  
5\. Describe a law you would like to introduce in your community.  
6\. Describe something irritating in your community.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 81 - Describe your first day at work or the place
where you study

place-where-you-study&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your first day at work or the place where you study.

**You should say:**

  *   What kind of building was it located in?
  *   Why was it important for you to work/study there?
  *   How did you feel at the end of the first day?

**and explain if you were pleased or disappointed with the experience.**

**Model Answer:**  
I am currently working in a company and I still remember the first day of my
job. This is my second job and I have worked for the first company for about 2
years.  
After I finished my graduation I applied in some companies and was interviewed
by them. One day I got a call from the HR head of the company that, I have
been hired and expected to join them from the next Sunday. I was very excited
and happy to get the job.  
  
I did my preparation part to start the office and reached the office 30
minutes earlier. The office was in a 10 story building and the office was in
the 6th floor. They had more than 90 employees. This was a modern building
with a big yard in front it.  
  
Then I contacted the HR head and submitted my academic and other relevant
documents. The HR asked me to sit at a couch and after 30 minutes or so
retuned. In the mean time I noticed other employees arrived and went to their
work desks. Most of them looked at me and one person asked me if I am waiting
for someone. I explained that I was joining from that day and he congratulated
me. I was feeling bit nervous and noticed that heart was beating bit faster!
The messenger came to me and offered me a cup of coffee. After the HR head
came back, he gave 2-3 forms including the contact papers and asked me to read
them all and fill up the forms. I read the papers and filled up the forms and
gave it to the HR. The HR then took me to some of the key employees and
introduced me to them. Then he showed me my desk and I sat over there. Since
this was the first day of my office, I did not have any particular task. I
started feeling easy after I sat on the desk and started using the computer.
The computer was pre-configured and I went through the company website and
learned lots of new information about their service and product offerings.  
  
I took my lunch in a nearby cafeteria and came back to my desk again. Thus the
clock ticked to 5:30 pm and I noticed others were leaving. I asked the HR and
left with some of the employees.  
  
I felt very comfortable at the end of the day and the hesitation I had has
been removed and I was happy for the reason that the office environment and
colleagues were very friendly.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card topic:

If you are a student, you should talk about your first day experience in the
college/university you are studying currently. For the job holders, it is
expected that they would talk about their first day experience in their
office. The cue card questions added with the cue card question guides you on
which topics you should speak about.  
For the first question ‘what kind of building was it located in’, you should
give details of the area where the university/office was located. Give brief
details of the premises and then mention particularly what type of building it
was. Mention the following points:

  * How many building were there?
  * How many levels the building had?
  * Which floor you went first and stayed?
  * Where your class/ office desk was?
  * How was the environment?

Now move on to the second question and give your reason for your study or
doing the job. This is a bit tricky question as you would have to be very much
convincing here. Mention that, the study / job was very important because you
have been waiting a long to have this. The students should mention some
important factors about having a higher degree and the job holders should
explain that this was a job s/he was eagerly waiting for. The education is
important to enlighten someone’s mind and to prepare him/ her to become a
successful person in life. In today’s world, there is no alternative of
education. For the job holders, the job is the source for their daily breads
and a way to implement the theoretical knowledge s/he has learned throughout
the academic years. It is also the way to serve other people and to get
engaged in work.

For the third question “how did you feel at the end of the first day” mention
that it was better than you expected. At the beginning of the day, you had
anxiety and tension but at the day you found out that it was a good day so
far. You found the classmates/ colleagues very friendly and helpful, the work/
study environment was pleasant and you actually enjoyed there a lot.

Also mention that, the first day at work/ study place is always a great
concern in terms of new people, new environment and everything was fine for
you and at the end of the day you felt relieved and happy about the day.  
  
You have already mentioned your experience of the first day at work/ study in
the third question and that’s why you need to draw a summary for the last
question “explain if you were pleased or disappointed with the experience.”
Unless you have specifically mentioned previously that it was a bad experience
and you had lots of troubles, you should mention that it was a pleasant day
and you had been delighted with your experience of your first day at work/
study.

**Similar Cue Card Topics:**  
  
**1\. Describe your work place.  
2\. Describe a college/ university where you studied.  
3\. Describe a pleasant experience you recently had.  
4\. Describe building.  
5\. Describe a positive experience you have.  
6\. Describe a stressful day you had.  
7\. Describe a busy day you had.**

period

-long-period&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a room where you stayed for a long period.

**You should say:**

  * What was the room?
  * What did you do there?
  * Why did you spend so much time in there?

**and describe the memory you have regarding this room.**

**Model Answer:**  
I have stayed in my university hostel for about 5 years and this is the room I
would like talk about. This room was in the 3rd floor of the university hostel
and my room number was 230. I shared this room with another room mates and I
had total 3 roommates during the time I stayed there. This was a medium size
room with the usual furniture for 2 students provided by the university. The
best thing about the room was that it was in the corner of the 3rd floor and
as a result it was quieter than other rooms. There were 2 big windows and I
got fresh air in summer seasons. The university had their own water supply and
electricity supply and because of that we enjoyed uninterrupted water and
electricity supply.  
  
I lived there for a long time and because I was a student that time, I mostly
studied, slept and enjoyed my friends company there. In the morning I left the
room for classes and mostly came back in the evening. I studied till 12.00 and
then slept. Sometimes I played indoor games, watched movies, listed to music
and cooked in my room. I spent the time there because I was arranged by the
university and was inside the university premises. I needed only 5-10 minutes
to attend my class from my room and that was very convenient. Another reason I
stayed there is the cheap rent which was significantly lower than the cost of
living outside the university.  
  
I have lots of memories regarding this room. I have spent a golden time there
where I studies, gathered with friends, learned many new things and felt like
home. I learned how to cook during my stay there and there are several times
the things I cooked were not easy to eat as I had been a horrible cook. Later
I developed my skill on cooking and I guess I would have never learned it
unless I stayed there.  
  
I often had friends whom I talked and played with whole night if we did not
have classes next day. There were some ghost stories regarding this room and
my roommate once got freighted because he heard that someone was moaning
outside though he found none outside. Since I do not believe in ghost stories,
I have never encountered any situation like that.  I cherish the memory I have
regarding this room as I have spent a long time there and enjoyed my stay.  


###  ﻿Tips for answering this cue card topic:

You are expected to talk about a room in which you stayed for a long time.

common activities like study, sleep, research, napping, writing can be
mentioned for this question.  For the question ‘why you spent so much time in
there’ state that this was your living room and the most favourite place and

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a gift that you gave to someone recently.

**You should say:**

  * What was the gift?
  * Whom did you give it to?
  * How did you feel about it? Why?

**and explain why you chose this gift.  **

**Possible Answer:**    
The gift I gave to my younger sister recently is the one I would like to talk
about. I gave her a cell phone recently. The model of the cell phone is Sony
Experia Z and it has Android Operating System. This is a water resistant cell
phone manufactured by Sony Mobile and is a hot one in the market. The cells
phone cost me around 40 K and I had to save the money for the last 6-7 moths
to present her the gift.  
  
I knew that she had been wishing to buy a smart phone for a year but could not
do so. I thought to buy her one in her next birthday and started saving the
money. I saved almost 7-8 k each month and just before 3-4 days of her
birthday, I bought the phone.  
  
I felt really great after I gave the gift to my sister. That was an
unexplainable pleasure, amusement, satisfaction that I felt after I saw her
bewildering face after she opened the gift. She was so happy that I felt like
that was a perfect gift for her. I am sure I would not have felt the same
pleasure as I felt giving her the gift doing something else. She had been
longing to own a smart phone and after receiving it from me she hugged me.  
  
As I already told, from her conversation I knew that she wished to own a smart
phone that she would be able to use internet and take quality photographs.
From that day, I promised to myself that I would buy her one. And I wished to
buy her a really good one. I could have bought her a phone for 10k but
seriously I wanted to give her the best one that I can accommodate.

and this is the latest gift you gave to someone.

Whatever the gift was, you should be very fluent describing the event, gift
and occasion of the gift. First mention what was the gift item and then
mention to who you gave it to. Also mention if you were planning to give it
for a long time or did you instantly bought this gift. After that give an
approximate cost idea that you had to spend to buy this gift. Also mention the
occasion for the gift. That can be a birthday gift or so or can be a surprise
gift.

The final 2 questions require your elaborate discussion on the topic and
expect you to talk about how you felt after giving this present. Simply
mention that you were very much pleased to be able to give this present to
that person and the excitement grew even more when you noticed the happiness
about it. For the final question ‘and explain why you chose this gift’ say
that you knew that s/he was in need of that/ was eagerly waiting to have one
of these items/ would be very excited and happy to receive it. You can also
mention, you had no previous preparation for buying a gift and you roamed in a
gift shop and chose this one all of a sudden.

Your fluency and coherency in speaking is the most important parts of your
speaking exam. Being able to cover the questions asked with the cue card topic
in a real life conversational way would ensure a good score in your cue card
section.  
  
Since this cue card asks you to talk about a gift you gave to someone
recently, you should relate the event to a recent occasion. Mention that you
gave this gift only few weeks/ months ago and that you make your speaking
exactly what is expected in the cue card topic.

If the gift is for a family member like younger sister, mother or father,
mention how eagerly you were expecting to give this gift to him/her. After
that mention how you managed to purchase the gift and from where you bought
it. For the question _“How you felt about it?”_ Mention that you bought this
gift to make this person happy. This might not be an expensive gift but you
bought it with good wished and cordial love. Finally say that, the recipient
of this gift was very happy to have it and that made you feel really good. A
gift is always a souvenir of good wishes and a mark for better relationship
and you felt just happy to be able to give it to this person.

The final question _“and explain why you choose this gift?”_ is a tricky one
and you are expected give a convincing answer for this question. You have your
own reasons and following are some of the helpful hints for you to answer this
question:  
  
1.  I knew that s/he had a great desire for this and I thought this would be
perfect opportunity to give it to him/her.  
2.  I was suddenly informed about this occasion and I had to pick a gift
quickly. I went to the nearby gift shop and this particular gift caught my
eyes.  
3.  This was a gift I was long longing to give her/ him. I knew s/he would be
very happy to receive it and that’s why I bought it.  
4.  The gift was a shared one and three of our friends / colleagues decided
that it was a good gift within our budget.  
5.  I knew that s/he loves this sort of gift and that’s why I decided to give
it to her/ him.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion.

**Q. Do you enjoy giving and receiving gifts? Why or why not? **  
**Answer:** I really love it! I enjoy quite a lot exchanging gifts. To me this is a token of appreciation and a symbol of care.   

I like a lot to have presents from people I appreciate, care and love. I think
that by gestures like gift exchanging, you are able to judge who is a real
friend or how valuable you are to someone. For example, as gifts are given in
special circumstances, it helps you understand if someone likes you,
appreciates you, loves you or value you. It not only depends on the kind of
gifts and prices but also how carefully and honestly the gifts were selected
and given to you. In addition, this gesture is pleasant as it means that
somebody shares a significant moment of their life with you.

Giving presents to someone is quite enjoyable because through this you can
show your respects, love and care for someone. Gifts often reflect someone’s
personality and character and also visualize how much you care for someone.
For me, giving gifts to a relative, family member or friend is quite
fascinating and an act of showing I care.

_**Tips: **_It is very less likely that someone would not like to give and
receive gifts. However if you are one of them, who doesn't like receiving
presents, you can just say the reasons. Some examples are that- you feel that
you are obligated to repay them, you might not like the present but you must
keep it because the opposite is disrespectful, you just invite someone to an
important event of yours not for bringing gifts but because you want them
there for you.  
  
About those who don't like giving presents you can say that it is costly, you
don't know someone so well so you can't pick a present for them, gifts do not
always represents that the giver cares about you or it is a custom that is
inflicted by other generations, people often give flowers, toys and chocolate
and you are allergic to flower, do not like chocolate and hate toys.

**Q. Who usually gives you gifts?**  
**Answer:** My parents, relatives and friends mostly give me gifts. But, I received some fabulous presents from my godmother when I graduated from university. However, I will never forget the gift my brother gave me and it was a ticket to England! 

Tip: You can say that you receive presents from parents, friends,
grandparents, godmother and godfather, uncles, cousins, siblings even
teachers, colleagues and bosses. If you want you can mention one or two
examples when you were given some important gifts.

**Q. Who do you give gifts to?**  
**Answer:** I mostly buy presents for my friends on their birthdays. This is the most common case, but I also give presents to my parents at their wedding anniversary. So I would say family and friends are the people I buy gifts for. The latest gift that I gave to one of my friends on her birthday was a book he wanted to have. 

**Q. In your country when do people usually give gifts? **  
**Answer:** I don't think that in my country this custom is very different from that of other countries. Specifically, people buy presents on name days and birthdays, wedding anniversaries and graduation ceremony. There are also some cases, such as when someone is admitted in university or is promoted at work, but these aren't so common in my country. Some festivals also encourage people to exchange gifts. 

_**Tip:**_ If in your country this isn't the case, you can just mention in
which occasions people give presents. Remember that these answers are based on
my experiences and personal opinions and it doesn't mean that they represent
every case in every country.

**Q. What kinds of gifts do they give? **  
**Answer:** The type of presents depends on the occasion, a person's personality, choice, economic &amp; social status and so on. You can't give the same present all the time because not everything suits to everyone and this is completely reasonable. Some examples that I can think are clothes, books, perfumes, shoes, house hold appliances, and bags especially on birthdays. But, there are some cases that presents are much more different and expensive. When someone, for example, gets married you can give them household and electric appliances, money or even a car. 

**Q. Do you think gift-giving customs are different now than they were in the past? How?**  
**Answer:** I am not quite sure how the gift exchanging was in the past generation but I believe that they don't differ much. I assume that in the past, presents were given in the same occasions as we do nowadays. The only thing I reckon that's different today is the kind of gifts given. The reason and occasions of gift-giving remained the same throughout the generations, I guess. 

**Q. Do you think they will change in the future? How?**  
**Answer:** It's a thoughtful issue but my personal opinion is that it may change in the future. In future people will be able to buy presents not only in usual occasions but also whenever they want to. Furthermore, if some commodities become more affordable there is a possibility that this trend will be much different in the future than it is now. People will be more practical while choosing a gift for other and the range of gifts would increase. However, the grand gesture and underlying reason for gift-giving will remain almost same as it is today. 

**General Tip: **Don't always try to give a big and extended answer. Apart from the fact that time is limited it's a speaking exam that assess your skill of handling the language -English, not the intellectual level. Speaking more would expose you to make more mistakes. Try to give clear and substantial answers. So don't worry if some of your answers are bigger than others.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a building / structure with architectural interest.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * what's the historical significance of it
  * Why should we preserve it

**and describe the building / structure in details.**

**Model Answer:**  
The Leaning Tower of Pisa which is also known as Tower of Pisa is an
interesting structure situated in the Pisa city of Italy.  It is the third
oldest structure in Pisa's Cathedral Square and very famous for its unintended
tilt to one side.  
  
The height and width of the tower is around 183 feet and the width is higher
in the lower part than the top part. This tower has 296 steps and offers a
great architectural value to the world. The tilt of this tower was not planned
and occurred unintentionally. During the construction phase the tilt was
created because of the inadequate foundation on ground on soft ground. Later
this tilt increased until the structure was stabilized. Around 200 years were
taken to build this greatest structure. There are some debates about the real
architect of this world famous structure and it has been credited to Guglielmo
and Bonanno Pisano as the architect of this structure. But recent studies
imply this credit to Diotisalvi as the original architect.  
  
This structure has many historic significance and was one of the seven
medieval wonder of the world. The people of Pisa started building this
structure to show the rest of the world about the importance of the Pisa city.
The plan included a cathedral, a baptistery, a bell tower and a cemetery. The
construction began at around 1173 and completed in the middle of 1300. This
famous tower is not known only for the great beauty of its Romanesque
architecture but also for its historical significance. The famous astronomer
Galileo Galilei is said to have dropped a cannon ball and a musket ball bot
hat a time from the Tower of Pisa to prove that weight does not affect the
dropping speed of an object.  
  
This structure was listed in the UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 and had
been very famous as one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World.

sample%2F756-ielts-cue-card-sample-99-describe-one-of-your-favourite-
electronic-media&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe one of your favourite electronic media like TV / printing media /
radio etc.

**You should say:**

  * what is it and why it's your favourite
  * what do you do with it
  * why it's useful for you

**and describe the advantages and disadvantages of this media.**

**Model Answer:**  
My favourite electronic media is TV and I guess this is the most popular
electronic media in the world. With the popularity of the satellite and
diversity and quality of the programs offered by different channels, people
started liking the TV programs more than ever. With the TV satellite network
connection, watching more than 500 channels cost a very little amount.  
  
Television offers various kinds of channels and people can easily pick the
channels they like. News, Movies, documentary, entertainment, soap opera,
music, sports, lifestyle channels offers entertainment as well as different
information and news. People heavily rely on TV news for latest and
international news. The audio visual representation of news and information in
TV are easier to grasp than other media like radio and magazines. I watch
news, documentary, movies and music on TV. There are lots of channels that
offer specialized programs for people and among them I find National
Geographic, Discovery, BBC are very reliable and authentic source of
information.  
  
I can’t always catch up with the newspaper and can easily get updates from TV
in few minutes. I get sports news and can watch live games on TV. The main
advantages of television are the ease with which it offers news, information
and entertainment. One can easily watch TV while getting involved in other
tasks which is quite impossible for other media like print media. The
variation of program and channels offered are helpful for people to easily
pick one’s favourite channels. We can watch live events and news on TV and
with the advancement of technology; it has become easier for everyone to own a
TV.  
  
The main disadvantage of this media is that, it is addictive. People become
addicted to TV programs and thus often spend more time watching TV than they
should have. Biased news sometimes mislead people and causes non-avoidable
conflicts. Too much time spent on watching television has some health issues
and specifically harms kids who watch TV for a long time. Apart from that,
Some TV channels broadcasts programs which are not suitable for all and this
can cause harms to people.

sample%2F750-ielts-cue-card-sample-93-describe-the-traffic-jam-in-your-
city&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe the traffic jam in your city.

**You should say:**

  * how it happens
  * what is the situation
  * what problems people face due to this.

**and what can be done to control this traffic jam.**

**Model Answer:**  
I come from (..say the city name…) and this city accommodates a large number
of population. Due to this huge population and the increased number of public
and private cars, the city often faces bad traffics.  
  
The number of people living in this city, the cars they are using and the
public transportation they need is higher than the number of roads. As a
result the traffic jam often occurs and people have to suffer. Another reason
for the traffic jam is the unauthorized parking if cars in the street. People
do not often follow the exact traffic rules and because of their sincerity, we
often face the horrible traffics in the street.  
  
 The traffic jam in our city is one of the terrible things the city dwellers
have to face. People get stuck on the roads and they have no idea when they
would be able to reach their destination. Because of this jam, people often
miss important schedules, students can’t reach school in time and the outcome
is devastating. Because of the jam in the street people have to schedule
accordingly and the total time killed in the street is simply a waste of time.  
  
There are many steps which should be taken to reduce the jam in the street.
First of all the people who are driving in the street should very strictly
follow the traffic rules. The traffic control authority should more strictly
apply the rules. The number of private automobiles is increasing rapidly. Many
single families own multiple cars and thus increase the number of total cars
driving in the street. The rule should be imposed on purchasing cars and the
price of the fuel could be increased as well. The public transportation system
should be improved so that people can travel on public cars. The city has more
population than it can comprise and decentralization of industries, offices
and educational institutes can be another solution to this abhorrent problem.

thing-you-did-recently&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an unusual or interesting thing you did recently.

**You should say:**

  * Where did you do it?
  * When did you do it?
  * Who did you do it with?

**and describe why it was unusual or interesting.**

**Model Answer:**  
Few months back while our visit to a friend’s hometown, all of a sudden the
friend proposed us to go inside a nearby forest and have a picnic there. This
was a plan proposed by Arnold (...say one of your friend's name...) and 4 of
our friends agreed to do so.

This was bit dangerous as people scarcely go inside the forest and from the
local people we have heard different scary and wild stories about this jungle.
Our main attraction was the abandoned house inside the jungle and we planned
to do the picnic there and take photos of wild lives and the abandoned house.
We knew that my friend's guardians won't permit us to do that and hence we
planned not to let them know about it upfront.

On a Thursday morning we left the friend's house and bought the necessary
ingredients, vegetables, foods and other things that would be required for us
to do the picnic. We entered inside the jungle and to our surprise the inside
was much more open and beautiful than we thought it would be. With some
difficulty we reached near the abandoned house and spent time till the
afternoon. This was a very exciting and unusual experience for us. We
collected some woods and made an arrangement for cooking. We eat the food we
cooked and that was horrible in taste. However, we were looking for the
adventure and interesting stuffs so a bad food did not kill our spirit. We
could not enter inside the abandoned house as it was blocked and very fragile.
We took several photos of the place and we notices some of the wild animals
were observing us with suspicion.

I have to confess that was a bit dangerous and imprudent thing to do but we
enjoyed our interesting and unusual picnic inside a forest.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your most favourite Math teacher.

**You should say:**

  * Name of the teacher and which class he taught
  * Why do you like him
  * How does he teach

**and explain how he influences students to learn math.**

**Model Answer:**  
As my major was Science both in school and college, I had Math in every year
and there are so many math teachers that I met throughout my academic year
that I can’t remember all of their names. Among this large number of teacher I
consider Mr./ Mrs. (…say a teacher name…) to be the best math teacher who
taught us math. His/her full name was (…say the full name…) and we called
him/her with his/her second name which is(….say his/her second name….).  
  
S/he taught us math in our grade 6 and his/ her way of explaining math and
solutions was unmatched. S/he had been successful to make an impression that
math is a very important subject and is far more interesting than some other
subjects.  
  
I like him/ her because of his/ her excellent way of teaching, his/her good
behavior and honesty. He/ she always started a story before explaining any
math and then s/he co-related this story with the math. S/he taught us formula
of math with a context and thus we could easily memorize those tough formulas.
S/he never forced for homework and had been very patience to explain things
over and over again. I’m sure the interest that grew in me on Math had been
influenced by him/her.  
  
The well-known fact that a good teacher teaches well and an excellent teacher
inspires student is completely applicable for him/her and s/he in my opinion
was an excellent teacher.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a training session that you have attended.

**You should say:**

  * where it was
  * what it was about
  * what was the most exciting and memorable part of it

**and explain what you learned from the training session.**

**Possible Answer:**  
Throughout my academic years I have attended many training sessions and today
I'd like to talk about the training session that I attended 3-4 years back
when I was in 2nd year of my graduation. The training session was on Advanced
Microsoft Office and presentation on Power Point. As a B.B.A student, I had
great interest on computing and I attended the session with an enrolment fee
of 500. The session was organized by a career building organization on our
city and they had a good reputation of conducting successful sessions and
training programs. Many of my classmates attended the session that held on the
3rd floor of the company's building.  
  
Initially we had some doubles about what we would learn from the session as we
already knew the basic Microsoft Office functionalities. But after the session
started we found that the session was organized by some professionals and
aimed for those who already knew some basics.  
  
The session started at around 10:00 am and ended at 4:30 pm with 2-3 breaks.
During the session, the professionals who were conducting the training, talked
to us about numerous career related topics and their way of presenting those
was very exciting. They told us many interesting facts and sometimes joke as
well and we could not restrain ourselves from laughing. The training part went
well and was interesting as well since we have learned many new things from
it.  
  
The advanced office functionality they presented was amazing. I never knew
that those things were possible with the programs I already knew! Later on the
power point presentation session went very well. We learned so many things and
became very excited. I was so interested that I went home in the evening and
at night I tried those lessons and functionality on hands in my computer.

sample%2F709-ielts-cue-card-sample-85-describe-an-outdoor-activity-that-you-
did-for-the-first-time&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an outdoor activity that you did for the first time.

**You should say:**

  * What did you do?
  * Where and when did you do it?
  * How did you feel later?

**and say if you would recommend this activity to your friends.**

**Model Answer:**  
I usually go out for walking in the evening every day and play some outdoor
games sometimes, but the outdoor activity that I did for the first time was
something different.  
It was in the middle of last year when I noticed that some of the people have
gathered in a field and they had bicycles with them. They were dressed like
professional cycler and were discussing something. That day I was with one of
my friends and we went out with our bicycles as part of our evening exercise.
My friend and I went closer to the group and heard that they are some members
of bicycling group who do the gathering and cycling as part of their outdoor
activity and exercise.  
  
After few minutes we found that they were planning to round the city in 3
hours with their bicycle and they would start that in next 30 minutes. The
team leader asked us to join them just when we were planning to leave. They
made us member of the group and it was free. We started cycling with them
starting from this place and went through the major parts of the whole city.
Cycling for the whole 3-4 hours was not an easy task and yet we enjoyed it and
were close to the group whole time. After few hours we came back to the place
where we started and I found that I was totally absorbed and exhausted.  
  
The team leader congratulated us because it was our first day and we did well.
I looked at my friend and he was looked exhausted and tired. The team gave us
a membership card and told that they do it twice in a month. Though we had
plans for joining them again, but we could not do so. I found the whole idea
of cycling very interesting and a good chance to meet new people. I felt well
that we actually did it and the feeling of travelling the whole city riding a
bicycle was thrilling.  
  
I would definitely recommend this activity to anyone capable as it would be a
good exercise as well as a chance to know different people who have some
common interests.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card Topic:

This cue card does not ask for any outdoor activity you often do but an
outdoor activity that you did for the first time. So describe something that
you rarely do and talk about the experience you have when you did it for the
first time. Following are some of the idea that you can follow to answer this
cue card:  
  
1\. Swim in the river for the first time.  
2\. Attending a political/ social rally.  
3\. Giving speech to the public for the first time.  
4\. Doing a picnic near a forest.  
5\. Playing an outdoor game that you usually do not play.  
6\. Participating in a rally.  
7\. Participating in a social welfare program.  
8\. Collecting donation for the flood/ cyclone victim.  
9\. Participating in a cycle/ motor race.  
10\. Playing ice hockey.  
11\. Mountain hiking.  
12\. Camping.  
  
Keep in mind that, you must mention that you did this outside activity for the
first time. You should also state that you did it recently. The first three
questions should be covered while you describe the activity and mention what
you did. Also mention that you felt very excited and happy after doing it. If
this activity is related to sports, mention that you never knew this sport was
that much exciting and amusing.  If it is related to a picnic or social
gathering, mention that that was a brand new experience and you would love to
do it again. Finally if this was related to public welfare (like collecting
donation for flood victims or participating in a rally) you should mention
that you felt very much happy and overwhelmed after doing it.  
  
For the final question “and say if you would recommend this activity to your
friends” mention that you were very glad to have done this and you have
already recommended some of your friends so that they enjoy that activity as
well. Mention your happiness and excitement of this activity and then you
should say that you would love to mention that to your friends so that they

party for your friend

sample%2F706-ielts-cue-card-sample-82-describe-how-you-would-organize-a
-surprise-party-for-your-friend&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe how you would organize a surprise party for your friend.

**You should say:**

  * Where would you do it?
  * How would you do it?
  * What arrangements would need to be done for the party?

**and explain why would you do that.**

**Model Answer:**  
It is not always easy to organize a surprise party and I did organize such 3-4
surprise parties for my family members and friends. The surprise party I would
like to do is for one of my friends on his birthday. He is going to turn to 26
next February and I'd through a completely surprise party for him at his home.  
  
There is a good chance that his family members would organize a birthday
celebration on the day, so my planning would be to through it at 12:01 am at
night. I would keep everything secret from him and would let only 2-3 friends
know about the planning of the party who would also participate on organizing
it. We would buy a big birthday cake and birthday candles in the evening and
6-7 friends would gather together. We will buy our individual gifts for him
and would go to him home exactly at 12:00 am. We will then notify his mother
and would let her know that we are planning a surprise party for him. At
exactly 12:01 am we'll enter his house and probably there would be a lot of
shouting and birthday wishing. That would be a surprise for my friend as he
would have no clue about our arrival at his home on occasion of his birthday.  
  
He is a very good friend of mine and I remember him to be very supportive for
me several times. A birthday is very special for a person and people become
very happy when he finds that people who cares him also celebrates and
congratulates him on special occasion like birthday. I would organize the
surprise party to make him happy, to enjoy the occasion.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card topic:

People usually arrange surprise parties for friends on the following
occasions:  
1\. Birthday.  
2\. Marriage Anniversary.  
3\. First day at school.  
4\. First day at university.  
5\. Before departing the country.  
6\. On his/her mentionable success/ achievement.

  
Please note that, this cue card is bit different as it does not ask you to
describe something you did/ saw or plan. Rather it asks your hypothetical
description of a surprise party for your friend. Usually this type of party is
thrown for an occasion and without the knowledge of the person for whom this
is arranged.  
  
The description of this cue card would be your imagination of a surprise party
and you should be able to give a very resounding description of such a
surprise party.  
People usually arrange the surprise party at home/party center and then bring
the fried to totally surprise him/her. Sometimes this is known to all other
friends except for the person intended to be surprised. For the first
question, you should mention where you will actually arrange this party and
for whom. Then mention why you would like to arrange this party at that place.
For the second question specially mention your plan and details of this plan
for the party. State how you would keep it hidden from the friend you are
planning to through the party for and then mention what shorts of arrangement
you would do. Besides, you should speak about your relationship with this
friends and how intimate you two are. Then mention who would be invited in the
party and how they would help to make it a great party.  
  
A good description of the second question would actually cover the expectation
for the answer of the third question as well. The final question asks your
reason for arranging such a surprise party and here you should mention how
bosom you are with this friend and how much it means to you to make him/her
happy. A surprise party would be a memorable event for your friend and you
want to a person to arrange a party to make it memorable.

**Similar Cue Card topics:**  
  
**1\. Describe a party.  
2\. Describe a birthday day party.  
3\. Describe a party you recently had.  
4\. Describe one of your close friends.**

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your favourite subject in your academic life.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * Why did you like it
  * Your experience of this subject

**and explain why did  you like it.**

**Model Answer:**  
History was my favourite subject in my academic year and I have learned so
many things from the history books I read and learned from teachers related to
history and they were so interesting that I later did my graduation majoring
History.

Learning about the past history is something that gives us real knowledge
about our country, the world and about the human race. I read History in my
grade 7 and found it very interesting. This subject taught us about the past
of your world, how the social and economical condition was and how the world
has been shaped with the different events throughout the time. After that, I
become so interested on this subject that I started reading books on History
from different writers. There is a famous saying that, "to shape the future
you must know the past" and History teaches us that. I had been lucky to have
some great teachers who have tremendous way of explaining the topics of
History. To me, other subjects like literature and Math were also interesting
but I felt a different passion on History.

After I finished my school, I took History as my major and that has greatly
influenced me the way I look at the world and to the past and future. Reading
and learning history was like traveling through time and generations that
excited me so much.

without this computer. The references and helps I get from internet regarding

As I am still a student, I have a daily routine that mostly focuses on my
classes and study. Except for the Sunday, I spend my days mostly adhering to
this routine.  
I get up early in the morning mostly at 6:30 am and take a shower. I eat my
breakfast then and revise the study for that day. I reach my university at
around 8:30 am and attend the classes till 3:00 pm. I eat my lunch at around
1:00 pm from the university cafeteria. I usually spend some time with my
classmates after the class and return home at around 4:30 pm. I take some rest
and go to nearby fields in the evening. I walk for 1 hour ad return home at
6:30 pm.  
  
Then I take some light snacks and then start my study. I usually read till
9:00 pm and then spend some time using the computer and internet. I usually
browse net and maintain my social networking for about 1-2 hours. I eat my
supper at 11:00 pm and then read for another hour. Before I go to bed I brush
my teeth and read a novel. I read the novel for around 40 minutes to 1:30
hours and then fall asleep.  
  
I have been following this routine for the last 3 years. If I do not have
classes or if I have holidays, I go through a different routine which includes
watching movies, playing computer games, hanging out with friends etc.  
  
I enjoy the evening walking and my class times very much among the activities
of one of my typical days.

sample%2F710-ielts-cue-card-sample-86-talk-about-a-new-law-you-would-
implement&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a new law you would implement where you live to make it a
better place.

**You should say:**

  * What law would it be?
  * Will it be easy to introduce such a new law?
  * Will it be popular?

**and what the benefits of such a new law would be.**

**Model Answer:**  
The place I currently live in is a big city called (...say the name of the
city or are you live in…) and it has got lots of problems and issues which
need to be addressed. We have lots of laws and rules and many of them need
amendment and better implementation. If I am in a position to impose a new law
to make my city a better place to live in, I would make a new law that would
make it mandatory for every house owner to plant at least 10 trees at their
land and would prohibit cutting any tree unless permitted by the law enforcing
authority.  
  
A country should have at least 33% trees and forest of the total area for a
natural balance in the country and the existing percentage of trees and forest
in our country are alarmingly lower than that. Particularly in our city this
rate is almost less than 5% which makes it a imbalanced city to live in. It is
not easy to enhance the forests in this city as it is a populated city and has
very minimum open space. So making this rule a mandatory one would help us
make the city greener and better.  
  
Currently most of the houses do not have trees in the premises and there are
places where this can be done. So if every house owner of the city plants some
trees and takes care to grow those properly, that would improve the
environment of the city. Moreover, the house owners should not be free to cut
any tree whenever they want. They need to take permission and give proper
reasons if they really need to cut any tree.  
  
This would not be an easy law to implement. Lots of house-owners would not be
interested to follow this newly implemented law and would complaint that there
is no spare space for doing it. However, if the law is implemented and
imposed, over time that would be achievable. Once the consciousness and
necessity is understood and we start feeling our obligation towards the nature
and our society, many people would feel the importance of it.  
  
This new law would have a great numbers of benefits. There is no alternative
of planting trees and keeping the environment healthy and this law would make
our city a better place to live in.

###  Tips for talking about this Cue Card topic:

For this cue card topic you should speak about a new law that will do better
to your community and to the people of this community. Do not talk about a law
which is already enforced in your area as this cue card asks you to talk about
a new law you would like to implement to make your community/ area a better
place. First mention the exact law that you would like to introduce and then
mention the reason you would like to implement it.

Introducing a law which is politically controversial is something difficult
and if your law is going to make your area a better place, people would
embrace and welcome it. So mention that in term of obeying this law by people
is not a problem but the law enforcing authority and government must show
their good will to have it implemented and abided by.

Sine you are asked to introduce a law that would benefit the people of your
area, you should mention that it would become popular. Also mention that a
portion of the people who are involved in crime and making black money might
not easily accept this law but the mass people would heartily welcome it.

The benefit part should be based on the problem it would eradicate. Let’s say
if it is related to traffic law, mention the improvement the traffic system in
your locality would have by implementing such law. If the law is related to
street crime, mention that the new law would diminish such heinous crime.  
  
Following are some of the law ideas to help you talk about this cue card
topic:  
  
1\. **Energy saving:** Commercial markets must close the business hour in the
early evening.  
2\. **Drug issue:** Anyone related to selling drugs would not be allowed to
live in your community.  
3\. **Traffic issue:** Each private car must have at least 3 passengers in it
to run in the street. / No one would be allowed to park a car in the street
and doing so would be severely punished.  
4\. **Crime issue:** Carrying knife, bomb, gun or any such materials would be
prohibited.  
5\. **Economic issue:** Taking the VAT documents with a purchase is a must.

Please bear in mind that you are ask to introduce a new law that would benefit
the people of your area. So you should not introduce a law at your will. That
should be based on the problems that you think persist in your locality. Let’s
say, if drug is a severe issue in your area, you should mention a law that
would actually control it. Likewise, if there is a great problem of electric
load shading, you should mention the law related to energy saving.

**Your ability to talk about this cue card topic would also help you answering the following cue card topics:**  
  
1\. Describe something you would love to do for your locality.  
2\. Describe a problem your locality has.  
3\. Describe a law that would make your community a better place.  
4\. Describe a law that you like.

you-enjoyed-visiting&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a place near a lot of water you enjoyed visiting.

**You should say:**

  *     Where this place was
  *     Who you went there with
  *     What you did there

**And explain why you enjoyed visiting that place.**

**Model Answer:**  
I have visited many places near a river or a sea and I enjoyed the scenic
beauty and vast water very much. I would like to talk about a river I visited
2 years back. I chose to talk about it because I really enjoyed my visit
there.  
  
The name of the river was (_...say a river's name..._) and it was in (_...say
a place's name..._). One of our relatives invited us to visit their house and
we decide to visit there. I went there with 4 of my family members including
my parents. After we reach there, I was amazed to notice that our relative's
house was near a big river. This was the first time I visited that relatives
and I was very excited about the beauty of the nature there.  
  
After we reach our relative's house, my younger sister told me that she would
like to visit the river. I restrained her by saying that we will all go there
in the evening. In the evening we went near the river and the river was very
clam at that moment. A sweet wind was blowing from the river and the weather
was very pleasant. We sat near the river and had our tea. That was kind of
family picnic. I had my younger brother, sister, my parents and 3 of our
relatives at this place. Since this was the summer season, we felt very
comfortable being at the bank of the river. We noticed many boats were in the
river and we planned to rent a boat for an hour. When we were in the boat, the
wind suddenly started blowing heavily. We quickly came to the high land and
left for our relative's house.

**Alternative Answer:**  
I immensely enjoyed my journey at Miami beach (or say the name of any beach in
your country) last summer and I stayed there almost a week. This was a great
experience and really refreshing vacation for me. I stayed at a hotel very
near to the beach and enjoyed the life and nature of this place. The water,
people from different states, the sound of the sea, the tide gave a pleasure
that I cherished. This is one of the most famous beaches of the world and the
water is very clean. I had two friends (Mark &amp; John) with me and we
enjoyed the tide &amp; ebb, sunrise, sun shines, roaring of the sea and the
natural beauty surrounding the shore.

This is one of the most beautiful beaches of USA and a lot of people come here
every day especially in summer. I swam in the sea, ran and played in the sand,
made monuments with the sands, played beach volleyball with my friends, ate
sea fishes and other delicious foods during my stay. The sound of the wind
blow at night was something out of the world and hallucinating. I went along
the beach at mid-night and that was an experience incomparable to anything
else.

The beach is sandy and in the summer it glitters like the diamonds. The water
was fresh and blue and we could see the sky reflecting on it. The nights at
the seashore were mesmerizing and very much different than the day-life and
crowd. The moon reflected in the sea water and the strong and seductive smell
in the wind took me to a world unknown to me.

The journey was very much pleasant and refreshing for me. I enjoyed the
picture like sea, beach life and tasty Miami foods. The people were nice and I
talked to lot of people during my visit. The natural scenery of the sea and
the sea-beach is really something worth visiting. This sea water and its deep
blue color had a real attraction and illusion that took my heart away.

**Your ability to talk about this cue card would also enable you to talk about the following cue card topics:**

  1. **Describe a trip you recently had.**
  2. **Describe a beach you have visited.**
  3. **Describe a tourist attraction in your city.**
  4. **Describe a sea or river.**
  5. **Describe a naturally beautiful place.**
  6. **Describe a vacation you have had.**

you-own&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a piece of modern technology you own.

**You should say:**

  *     What it is
  *     What you use it for
  *     How long you have owned it

**And explain why it is important for you.**

**Model Answer: **  
I have several pieces of modern technology and electronic gadgets that I often
use and among them I would like to talk about the laptop I have. This is a
laptop computer which is manufactured by HP. This laptop has a good
configuration and it supports most of the latest software. It came with the
Windows 8 operating system and it was bit expensive for me to buy. I bought it
few months back when I replaced my old Dell laptop with this new one.  
  
I use it for my official purposes as well as personal purposes. I use
internet, communicate with my friends using this laptop. I sometimes prepare
some documents, surf internet and play games in it as well. This laptop serves
my entertainment also. I watch movies, listen to music and play games in it.
In fact, I use this laptop more frequently than any other electronic device I
have except the cell phone.  
  
I own laptop for more than 10 years but I bought this current one 3-4 months
ago. Since, the technology changes and to use latest software and to get
faster performance, we need to upgrade our computers and laptops, I replaced
my old laptop with this new one.  
  
As I have already mentioned, I use this laptop to use internet, play games,
create documents, contact my friends, maintain my blogs, watch movie, listen
to music and for many other important purposes. This laptop has become an
unavoidable technology for me that I use almost everyday.

**Alternative Answer: **  
In fact I own several tech-devices &amp; gadgets and among them I would like
to talk about the Kindle Fire that I have. This device is produced and sold by
Amazon and I ordered it from their website last year. This device is both a
tabloid and a digital book reader. To me it is a very important technology
device for purchasing online products, listening audio books and reading
eBooks. I have noticed that after I have bought this device, the percentage of
my reading has increased significantly. I use it to read eBooks and with the
Wi-Fi connectivity it has become easier to find books online. The charges last
for couple of days and this is a great device for reading books. As I bought
it last year, I own it for more than a year and with time this has become an
important electronic device that I own. This device is my best companion when
I make my journey. The perfect design, nice outlook, good quality hardware and
nice user interface make it an ideal device for book lovers. To me this is an
important device as this fulfils my appetite for reading. With the internet
connection with this device, I now have access to an immense number of books
and reading materials. Before purchasing it, I used to read 1 book in a month
on an average which has increased to around 3-4 books per month after I bought
this device.

I love and enjoy reading and this is a really good device for digital reading.
It is immensely important to read and for me this Kindle Fire is a companion I
would like have always with me. In fact, sometimes I consider it to be the
most important and utilitarian electronic devices I ever had.

###  Part 3: Two way Discussion:

**Q. How can technology make our life easier?**  
**Answer: **Technology can impact our life in many ways and so far technological advancement has made our life easier than ever. First of all, the internet has contributed to this to a large extent. This invention has dominated our daily life and made it easier by providing massive amount of information on different subjects.  It has also made communication faster and easier. For example, you can just press a button and all the desired results can be retrieved instantly. When I was at university, I found many helpful resources on the internet, while in the past students had to go to libraries and spend endless hours of searching. Going further, communication and shopping have improved as well. Nowadays, people across the world communicate whenever they want, whilst some decades ago this entailed time and money. Online purchases are a constant phenomenon, as you can buy anything you want by few mouse clicks and of course at a better price. Finally, smart phone is a representative example of technology that is used by everyone and because of its multiple functions things that were unattainable in the past, have become completely feasible now. 

Technology has made it possible to cure diseases that were incurable in the
past. It has improved the way we travel, cook, play, make relationship, spend
our leisure time and so on and on. The space exploration has enhanced our
perspective of life and universe while we can better fight the natural
disasters with the help of technology. In fact we are blessed with the
advancement of technology on every step of our life.

**Q. What are some greatest inventions you know about?**  
**Answer: **There are many remarkable inventions that have changed our lives and humankind. Automobile and light bulb are two of the most important things that were invented by Karl Benz and Thomas Edison in 1885 and 1870 respectively. The first device helps people commute whenever they want and wherever they are and the second has made working in dark places and at night feasible. We can't omit computer and the internet as well. The former was invented by Alan Turing, a British Mathematician and is a machine that takes information in, is able to manipulate it in some way, and outputs new information. The latter, allows people to access almost any information located anywhere in the world at any time. Its effects on business, communication, economy, entertainment and even politics are profound. Among other greatest inventions I should probably mention wheel, printing press, paper, Penicillin, Integrated Circuit and camera. 

_**Tip: **_These are only some of the inventions I consider that should be
mentioned. There are plenty of other devices that can be included. Some of the
greatest inventions of human history are given below from which you can select
your personal favourite to speak about:

Air Conditioning, Alphabet, Air plane, Automobile, Bar code, Battery,
Calculator, Camera, Candle, Cash Register, Clock, Coins, Compass, Computer,
Compact Disk, Credit Card, DVD, DNA Fingerprinting, Electricity, Email,
Engine, Fiber Optics, Film, Fuel Cell, Glass, Gun Powder, Ink, Internet,
Laser, Light Bulb, LCD, Matches, Mirror, Mobile Phone, Neon Lighting, Paper,
Pencil, Printing Press, Radio, Wheel.

**Q. Why should we restrict the use of mobile phone in public places?**  
**Answer: **The primary reason is that sometimes they can be intrusive and irritating. For instance, when they are used in hospitals or in public libraries they are really disturbing. Mobile usage in public libraries disturbs people from concentrating so they must always be turned to silent. A further reason is that cell phones can be considered as an antisocial means. In a little more detail, most of the time people send messages and make calls to their friends and relatives and this deprives them of face to face communication. A final reason could be health issues that are caused by cell phones. Due to radiation emission, headaches and migraines are a frequent occurrence as well as other health related problems such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and heart problems. 

**Q. Why mobile phones are gaining its popularity?**  
**Answer: **It's an undeniable fact that mobile phones are very useful. For example in case of emergency you can make a call and avert something unpleasant, something that without mobile phone possession would be unattainable. Moreover, these appliances enhance communication and help people retain relationships that they might otherwise be lost, take pictures to keep memories, access the internet and include different types of applications as well. So, all these functions are combined and contained to a single device, otherwise having different appliances for every single function would be very expensive and space consuming. This is less expensive to purchase and have many handy applications and usages. These are the main reasons cell phone are gaining its popularity so rapidly. 

**Q. Can you do without your mobile phone? **  
**Answer: **Unfortunately, the answer is no. Due to the fact that it's multifunctional, it constitutes an integral part of my life. I use it constantly every day to make calls and talk with my friends and family, send messages, access the internet, take pictures. I think I'll have a very difficult time even if I lose it for a while.

  1. **Describe something valuable you own.**
  2. **Describe an important possession you have.**

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a small company in your hometown that you think is successful.

**You should say:**

  * how you know it
  * what they produce
  * why you think it is successful

**and explain how you think it became successful.**

**Sample Answer 1:**  
This is an interesting question, because I think the answer I’ll give reflects
what I think of as ‘success’ to me being a successful business isn’t
necessarily about making the owner rich, or growing the company bigger each
year, it can be about other things too.

I’m going to tell you about a small company I know, how I know it, what they
produce and why I is I would call it successful.  As to how it became
successful, well I suppose I’ll have to just offer my best guess – if it was
possible to explain why a company does well I think we would all be
entrepreneurs in the making!

The company I am thinking of is run by a friend of mine.  We met through a
running club.  She makes very high quality bespoke cookies.  The biscuits
themselves are delicious, but actually it isn’t really so much about the food,
it’s about the way she designs and presents them.  She will do any design or
theme and create special shaped and decorated biscuits to order.  So, for
example, if you have a friend who is celebrating a special birthday, and they
love cycling and rock climbing, she might make up a box of biscuits including
one in the shape of a bike, some mountains and ropes to represent abseiling
equipment.  She does a lot of wedding favours – small biscuits with a personal
design incorporating the initials of the bride and groom on e.g. the number
plate of a classic car perhaps.  She even did a special order for me.  A
friend of mine had a riding accident and broke her arm very badly.  To cheer
her up I asked my biscuit making friend to make a very special box.  It
featured a cartoon version of the horse she had been riding; the back of an
ambulance; a syringe – to represent the morphine injections the paramedics had
issued, and a representation of my friend with her arm in plaster.  It was
brilliant!

As to why the business is successful, I think it’s for a number of reasons.
The actual cost of ingredients is quite modest so the overheads aren’t huge,
so my friend is able to add value through her art work.  She meets a niche
need, I don’t know of any similar businesses in the region so there is not too
much competition.  She can also send her biscuits through the post, and they
both travel and keep well, so she can supply all over the world – in theory at
least, a limitless market.  It helps that she is good at what she does so
repeat orders keep on coming.  However, whilst that explains how she keeps in
profit, for me what makes the business a success, is that she has found a way
of working for herself that generates an income, but gives her a really good
work life balance.  She can work flexibility and take time off when she needs
to.   If she wants to go for a run in the morning before work and start late
she can; if she thinks the lovely weather means she’d be better off working on
her allotment she can do that too – although of course the work has to be done
later.  It is fantastic that she has made a success of her business idea, and
the company has grown enough that she is also able to employ a part-time
assistant to help her in busy spells as well.

Setting up the business was an act of faith, there were no guarantees when she
started out, but she has worked hard, built up and retained a good reputation,
and her products always raise a smile of delight in the recipient.  Her main
problem is that customers complain her biscuits look to good to eat.  This
frustrates her, they are made for eating,’ keep a photo eat the biscuits’ is
her advice, and she should know, she baked them herself!

**Model Answer 2: **  
A small web design &amp; development company in my hometown in my opinion is a
successful company. The name of this company is ‘Net Gear’ (...say a name you
prefer…) and it was established by two young IT graduate only 3 years back.  
  
It has been proven to be a successful company because within 3 years it has
expanded rapidly and now they have 2 offices with more than 30 employees. They
have a good client base and since one of the owners is personally known to me,
I know that they are making an enviable profit. They have been awarded as a
promising IT firm last year and their success stories as well as 2 of their
world class software were reported in a local newspaper.  
  
I know the owners personally and the company office is near to my home. I have
visited there several times and thus I know many details of this company
including what type of works they do, who works for this company, what are
their products etc.  
  
This company is basically a web designing and development company and they
mainly desing and develop the eCommerce website for the clients. They have
some in-house software including Content Management software and an accounting
software.

After the owners started the companies there were only 5 employees including
themselves. They had only 2-3 clients and their office was in their personal
house. In 3 years they have worked hard and gained many successes including
the office and employee expansion, the output they produce and the revenue
they earn.

**Sample Answer 3: **  
I am going to talk about a small business, located in Tehran, the capital city
of Iran. I saw it on TV first. It produces variety of food products, food cans
and delicious sauce and additives. Approximately, its operation backs to over
15 years ago, when it was a small factory in the North of Iran. Gradually, it
was expanded to other parts of country, and its numerous branches made it a
very prosperous business.

While the number of its branches was only 2 in 2000, it reached almost 50
across the country. Besides, the number products increased from 10 items to
just over 100 items.

Lastly, the quality of its products has been improved fundamentally compared
to the past, leading it to open some branches in other countries and becoming
a famous brand of food-company.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a meal you enjoyed.

**You should say:**

  *     Who was there
  *     When and where you ate it
  *     What you had to eat

**And explain why you enjoyed the meal so much.**

**Model Answer:**   
I went to visit (_...say a foreign country name or city name..._) last year
and stayed there for about a month. The food habits of people there were very
much different than what I usually eat. Since I had to stay for a while, it
was tough for me to enjoy the meals I was eating. Not that I disliked all the
foods I ate there. But the foods those were easily available were something I
ate but did not enjoy. After few days when I got a day-off, I went to visit
one of my relatives there. To my surprise, they prepared my favorite meal. The
four family members and I ate together and I ate voraciously as I enjoyed the
taste and flavor of my favorite foods.

I ate at this relative’s house and it the dinner that I ate there. I ate
(_...say some of your favorite food items..._) and I enjoyed the way those
were cooked and served. It was like eating a favorite food after a long.  


I enjoyed the meal because they were my favorite foods and I ate those after a
while. Eating different foods all of a sudden for few days was kind of a tough
thing and when I ate my known foods, I ate the dish with great taste and
enthusiasm. Moreover, my relative and her husband had been very cordial and I
enjoyed their company and the way they served me the dish.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a wedding you attended.

**You should say:**

  *     When it was
  *     Who got married
  *     What happened at the wedding

**And explain whether it was a typical wedding ceremony.**

**Model Answer: **  
One of the memorable wedding ceremonies that I attended and enjoyed was the
wedding party of my cousin. It was in the year 2007 and I was 21 years old at
that time. I can recall that it was mid-summer and I took 4 days leave from my
university to attend the program.  
  
My cousin Ruby got married and she was the daughter of my eldest maternal
uncle. Among our cousins she was the eldest and she was 24 years old when she
got married to a doctor. I was in the wedding from the very beginning:
shopping till the departure of the bride to her father-in-laws house. The
whole house was decorated, we celebrated a ceremony 3 days long, lots of
relatives and neighbors came to congratulate the bride and they brought some
gifts for her as well. The host prepared several delicious dishes and sweets
and everyone wear new and traditional dresses. Every one enjoyed, sang and
danced, the whole program was recorded and every one cried when the bride left
the house.  
  
Yes that was a typical wedding that followed the general traditions and
customs. It was nothing different from the traditional marriages that are
generally performed in most of the part of the country except some minor
tribes and society. If fact we enjoyed the wedding because a typical marriage
ceremony in our country has lots of interesting and enjoyable parts that
people celebrates with boundless joys. We mostly followed the customs and
thoroughly enjoyed the whole wedding program.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a competition / contest you have entered.

**You should say:**

  * When the competition took place
  * What you had to do
  * Describe the competition

**and explain how you felt about the competition.**

**Model Answer 1:**  
Ooh, it’s quite hard for me to think about an example of a competition I’ve
entered as generally speaking I am not a very competitive individual!
However, I can think of one competition that I entered, which I think you will
find funny. I’m going to tell you what I had to do, what the competition was
for including the prize, and what happened after I entered.

Many years ago I used to live in a town called Leamington Spa.  One of the few
independent shops in the town was a large old-fashioned department store which
sold quite traditional items like haberdashery products for sewing and
knitting and gentlemen’s gloves and handkerchiefs.  Over time, they decided
they needed to extend their product range to attract new customers, so they
held a competition in a weekly local newspaper.  The competition was very easy
to enter, you simply had to complete your name and address on the coupon and
post it in to the newspaper offices of the Leamington Courier.  The prize was
to be a specially fitted lingerie set, as a way of launching their new
selection of ladies underwear!

I never win competitions, or I thought I never did.  So I was amazed when a
couple of weeks after posting my entry I received a letter telling me that I
was one of three lucky winners!  I was instructed to come to the store for a
fitting and informed that ‘a photographer from the local paper would be on
hand to photograph the winners afterwards!’  It was very funny, the letter was
badly written, and it made it sound as if we would be expected to pose in our
winning underwear and agree to be pictured in the local news!  
I duly went along to the store, where the comedy continued.  Although the
brassiere range was supposed to be suitable for women of all shapes and sized,
in fact none of the three of us who had won could be correctly fitted into the
bras available.  Embarrassed, the manager of the store offered us alternative
products, and the photographer from the paper said he still wanted a shot of
all the winners with an appropriate background. After some discussion, he got
us to peer into a brochure, as if choosing a glamorous underwear set, whilst
behind us were rails and rails of lingerie.  The lingerie department wasn’t
very big, and nor was it well lit.  Our photographer was unfortunately rather
generously proportioned and he struggled to move his ample frae between the
rails of clothes to get the right camera angle.  Eventually he stepped
backwards without looking properly, and as he did so knocked over some rails
of bras and knickers and ended up in a tangled heap of coat hangers, fallen
rails and covered in a selection of compromising underwear.  I hadn’t laughed
so much in years!

So how do I feel about the competition? Well, I was amazed to win something,
and I did end up with quite a nice new set of underwear for very little
effort, but most importantly of all I had a really hilarious day collecting my
prize and I hope you will agree I got a good anecdote out of it too!

**Model Answer 2:**  
I have attended many competitions in different phases of my life and have won
some prizes from those competitions as well. One such contest that I would
like to talk about was the Cycling competition that I participated in my
college.

I was then a student of college and around 15 years old. One day I noticed an
advertisement in our local newspaper that an inter-college cycling competition
would held on next week. The entry fee would be $20 and the prizes would be
given to the first three cyclers. I had a passion on cycling and I that’s why
I thought to participate it.

On the day of the contest I went to the starting point and registered my name
in the competition. I took my bicycle and wore my cycling dresses. I noticed
there were around 30 competitors and I was asked to stand at my start point.
With the sound of the whistle I start cycling. I had very less intension of
winning prized but I simply did concentrate on cycling. The total distance was
around 5 miles and that required some energy and time. After I finished the
racing, I was really surprised to hear that I won the third prize. I found
that some of my classmates were shouting because I was one of the three prize
winners.

I felt really happy and proud that I did well in this competition. Actually I
never took my cycling habit seriously and after I did well in that
competition, I started participating in other cycling competitions as well.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion/ Detail discussion:

**_Competitions in school:_**

Q. Why do you think some school teachers use competitions as class activities?

Q. Do you think it is a good idea to give prizes to children who do well at
school? Why?

Q. Would you say that schools for young children have become more or less
competitive since you were that age? Why?

**_Sporting Competitions:_**

Q. What are the advantages and disadvantages of intensive training for young
sportspeople?

Q. Some people think that competition leads to a better performance from
sports stars. Others think that it just makes players feel insecure. What is
your opinion?

Q. Do you think that it is possible to become too competitive in sport? In
what way?

hope-to-have&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe the job/ career you have or hope to have.

**You should say:**

  * What the job is
  * What is involves
  * Why you chose it

**and explain why you are interested about this job.**

**Model Answer:**  
I have recently finished my graduation majoring Computer Science and would
like to work as a computer programmer in a reputed software company. I have
learned few programming languages in my academic years and hope to work as a
programmer and want to contribute making some great software as every
programmer wants.

The job involves writing programming codes to make the required software. For
that a programmer must have good coding experience and need to understand the
requirement of the software. From retail shop to the nuclear research center,
everywhere computer software is used and I want to work for a company that
makes software for large scale clients. The programmer has to make sure that
the software runs without any bug and is time and cost efficient. They also
need to be a good team member; as bigger software are made by a team of people
rather than an individual programmer.

I chose it mostly because of my education and interest. Since I have studies
Computer Science, naturally I would want to work something that relates to my
education and skill. Secondly, I have a passion on writing software codes. I
have already made some small utility and web-based software while I had been
in my university. Now I want to create some larger-scale software that would
help me gain valuable experiences. Someone should work on an industry that
relates to his/ her skill set and synchronize to his/ her interest. The
software programmer's job perfectly suits my interests and academic
experience. Furthermore, the prospect of this job is very demanding and a good
programmer earns more than employees of many other industries. I am sure I
will enjoy working as a programmer than anything else and that's why I want to
work as a programmer.

**Alternative Answer:**  
I want to become an internationally famous journalist and the job as a
journalist is something I hope to have in the future. The job responsibilities
of a journalist involve collecting and writing the authentic latest news that
would be important for people. This is a great and noble profession. As a
journalist the person has a many responsibilities towards the mass people and
towards the society. He is true soldier of the society whose responsibility is
to represent the truth. Time to time s/he has to take great deal of risks to
collect the true and latest news and it is then published in a newspaper.

I like the idea of having a challenging job that will enable me to use my
determination, creativity, integrity; honesty and curiosity to do something
better for the people and for the society. The career as a journalist seems to
me the perfect opportunity to fulfill my vision, aspiration and good will to
serve the ordinary people of the society.  
  
The challenges, excitements, the commitments and the opportunity to serve the
people are the main reasons I am interested to have my career in journalism.
The job of a journalist also demands the person to travel a lot and take lots
of challenges and I have great passions both on these two things. For all
those reasons I am interested to have a career as a journalist.

**Follow up Questions: **

**1\. How to make a good first impression in a job interview?**

**Answer: **

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk to you about how to make a
good first impression in a job interview.  I will talk about why this is
important; things you can do to help you create that perfect ‘first
impression’; how to leave the interviewer with a good ‘last impression’ and
finally I will wish you success in your future job search.  
In a professional situation, first impressions are extremely important.  If
for example you are attending a job interview, you need to create a good
impression as soon as you meet.  That way the employer is more likely to want
to offer you the job.

There are many things you can do to help you create the best possible
impression.  For example: Be on time!  If you have an appointment, it is
important to arrive a few minutes early so that the meeting can start exactly
on time.

Make sure you are appropriately dressed.  If it is a job interview, it is a
good idea to dress smartly.  It will help you to feel confident and will make
you look more professional.  
Make sure you are clean and well presented, you should not smell of cigarette
smoke.  Make sure you do not have anything caught between your teeth!  Look in
a mirror before you go in to make sure you look OK.

Smile, it helps you to relax and will make you look friendly.  In many
cultures it is important to make eye contact with the other person – but do
not stare or it will feel uncomfortable!  For a job interview, it is usual to
shake hands.  You might want to practice doing this so it will feel natural to
you.  Wait for the interviewer to ask you to sit down.

When you sit down, try to look confident and relaxed, sit back on the chair
and thank the interviewers for inviting you in to talk to them.   Do not
slouch and look too relaxed, but do not perch on the front of the seat either
– you will look uncomfortable and it will make your interviewers feel
uncomfortable too!

You will also create a good impression at interview if you have prepared
thoroughly for the meeting.  Make sure you have researched the job and the
company.  Be clear about what you can offer them and why you would be good at
the job.

When you answer questions, try to be positive and enthusiastic as well as
friendly.  Show your personality as well as your skills. At the end of the
interview, you need to think about the last impression you make on the
employer.  That way, they will remember you more positively.  Thank the person
for seeing you, stand up, shake hands again and smile as you leave the room.
You want the interviewer to think as you leave ‘what a lovely candidate, I
would like them to come and work with me!’

I hope if you follow this advice it will help you to form a good impression at
interviews when you meet people for the first time in a formal environment.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a birthday celebration that you attended recently.

**You should say:**

  * Whose birthday it was
  * who attended the party
  * where did it take place

**and describe the party.**

**Possible Answer:**  
I would like to talk about a birthday celebration that I attended 2/3 months
ago. It was one of my friends' birthday who turned 25 that day. My friend's
name is Ryan and his parents wanted to celebrate his birthday just before his
departure to United Kingdom. Ryan invited almost all of his close friends and
6-7 of us attended the birthday celebration together. Apart from us, there
were as many as 100 other people present on the occasion. I did not know most
of them but my guess is that they would be mostly Ryan's relatives, neighbors
and his father's colleagues.  
  
The party was celebrated at my friend's house at (...tell a city name....). We
went there together and bought a present for the Ryan. After reaching there,
Ryan and his parents warmly welcomed us. Later Ryan introduced us to his
relatives and to some of his neighbors. We were astonished when we saw the
huge birthday cake. 25 candles of different colors were lit around the cake
and the whole house was redecorated for the occasion. Anybody could say that
some occasion was going on in this house without knowing anything.

We sang the birthday song when Ryan cut the cake. We congratulated him and
wished him a prosperous life ahead. Then we ate cake and had a good feast. The
foods were delicious and good. We, friends of our circle, went to visit a
nearby place and sang different songs. In the evening we went to Ryan's house
again and attended a raffle draw. That was a very exciting part of the
birthday celebration. Then after few minutes we left the party and went our
homes.

##  Talk about a house or an apartment you would like to live in.

**You should say:**

  * what it would look like
  * how big it would be
  * where it would be located

**And explain why you would like to live there.**

**Model Answer: **  
I currently live in our house which is a 2 storied building. But in future I
would like to live in a farm house in my hometown. The house would be a small
one with 4-5 rooms in it. But there would be plenty of trees, gardens, ponds
and open spaces in from of the house. I want to live close to nature rather
than living in a crammed metropolitan building. The house would be built with
woods, leaves, some modern materials and tin. There would be a big veranda in
front of the house. Trees would be all around the house.  
  
This would not be a very big house in terms of the size of the rooms. But
definitely the total farm house would be well over 1 acre. I would not require
a very big house because I won’t have so many furniture and show pieces. I
will have only necessary house hold appliances and furniture.  
  
This house would be located at our home town which is _(…say your hometown
name...)_ in (...say the district/ division/ country name/ city name...). We
already have a house there but I would convert it to a farm house in future
when I will start living there.

Currently I am living in a metropolitan city and leading a busy life. I do not
wish to live in this crowded and busy city after my retirement. I have plan to
take early retirement and then build a farm house in my hometown that would
allow me living in a place which offers fresh air, clean environment, polluted
free living and healthy and fresh foods. This is the main reason I want to
live there. Secondly, I already have a house there and converting it to a farm
house would not be that difficult. Finally I don’t want to live an idle life
after my retirement and building a farm house and living there would allow me
to get involved in many works that I won’t be able to do at my current living
place.

**You should say:**

  *     What the project was
  *     Who else was involved in it
  *     How long it took

**And explain what you learned from this project.**

**Model Answer:**  
I have worked on several projects both in my school and in my office and among
them I would like to talk about an electronic project that I worked on in my
college level. It was a physics project in our final terms and we had 3 team
members. We were asked to create 2 radio devices that would be able to clearly
communicate with in the 300 meter range.  
  
Our physics teacher Mr. Newphen gave us the talks and I worked in this project
with two other classmates of my college. The teacher gave us 15 days time but
after 10 days passed, we noticed that more than half of the task was pending
and we extended the time. The work tool around 22 days for us to complete and
show the demo.  
  
We had to create two radio devices that would basically similar to the devices
the traffic controlling officers usages. But our device would have a shorter
range and would work with in 300 meter. Another objective was for us to make
such two devices with a very minimal cost.  
  
We had to work hard to make it work. I learned many things from this project
like, how to work on a major project with a team, how to reduce the
interferences of radio frequency, how to build quality equipment in low
budget, how to fine tune a project and many other things that later became
handy for my university and office projects.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about your most favourite library.

**You should say:**

  * What is it and the location of it
  * How it is beneficial
  * What do you do there

**and explain why this is your most favourite library.**

**Model Answer:**  
The central city library in my locality is my favourite library. This is a
library which is run and funded by the Government and local officials and is a
renowned library in our city. This is more than 100 years old and has a very
rich collection of books, journals, reference books, novels and other reading
materials. This library has recently introduced some digital formation and
gives the facility to read books in electronic devices. Almost 200 people go
to this library everyday and it offers a really quiet and calm environment for
reading.

This library offers many benefits and the most important thing is about a
library is that it comprises books that are main source of knowledge. This
library has more than 20,000 books and people can easily find a book that
might interest them or the books they were looking for. Students come here to
take reference for their study materials and to take notes, the literacy
lovers come to read novels and stories by world renowned writers, the regular
members can take books to their home and thus can read in their free time.
Time spent in a library is a wise investment and I feel that the contribution
of this library towards making a literate and conscious generation is
unmatched.

I often go to the library to read books that are in my "must read" list.
Besides, this is a good place to take notes and to read and I often go there
for my study purpose. As I am a subscribed member of this library, I can take
books to my house and I usually return those books in every 4-5 days to take a
new one.

There are lots of famous libraries in my country and in the world that I heard
about and yet this is the very library that helped me grow my interest on
extra-curricular reading habit. I have read books from this library that have
greatly helped me and because of that, I like this library more than any other
library in the world. Furthermore, the environment of reading, the staff, the
arrangement of books, the rich collection and my easy access to this library
make it my most favourite library.

childhood&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a favourite book in your childhood.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * Who is the writer of the book
  * What was the story of the book

**and explain why it is your favourite book from childhood.**

**Model Answer: **  
‘The Diary of a Young Girl’ which is also known as ‘The Diary of Anne Frank’,
was one of my most favourite books in my childhood. I was so touched by this
books and enjoyed it so much that I read it 2-3 times. This book was published
from a diary written by a young girl named Anne Frank. My father gave this
book as my 11th birthday gift and I read it when I was 11 years old. I have
even read it when I grew up and was a student of college. To my surprise the
book was as appealing and touchy as I found it in my childhood.

The book was adopted from the diary Anne Frank, who was a teenage girl around
13 years old at the time of writing her diary. She originally wrote in Dutch
language and later this book was translated in more than 60 languages
worldwide. She wrote the diary when she and her family were in hiding for two
years during the Nazi occupation of the Netherland during the Second World
War.

Anne got a diary as a birthday gift when she turned to 13 and she began to
write in it from 14th June, 1942. At that time the Nazi occupied the
Netherland and they were in hiding into a sealed-off upper room of Anne’s
father’s office building in Amsterdam. They remain hiding there for two years
and Anne wrote the events of the people living there, her personal thoughts
and what happened that time.

She has a good relationship with her father and a poor relationship with her
mother. She admired her sister’s talent and intelligence and calm nature. She
was initially irritated about Peter, a boy of her own age and later on they
two became very close. Thus a little girl wrote about relationship, people’s
mentality, perception of human, little joys and sadness of life and revealed
the suffering of the people due to the war.

Anne dies when she became 15 years old after they were betrayed and found by
the Nazi. Sadly she dies only 2 weeks before the British troops liberated the
prisoners from the concentration camp. After her death the diary was bit
censored and was published with her father’s permission who was the only
survivor from the Nazi camp.

The suffering of the people during the war, the felling and thought of a young
girl, her complaints and happiness, her perception of life were so brilliant
that it touched my heart. I could not leave the book until I finished it and I
was deeply touched to read the thoughts of a young and brilliant girl who was
killed at her 15.

**Model Answer: **  
In my opinion the ‘Reader’s Digest’ is an interesting magazine that I like to
read. I am not pretty sure where I first heard about this magazine but I think
I found my father bought this magazine sometimes and from there I came to know
about this magazine. Later on I have bought this magazine from the nearby
paper stand and after reading several copies of this magazine, I learned the
contents and stuffs of this magazine.  
  
This is a common magazine in our country and can be found very easily. Almost
every paper stand has this magazine. I can buy it from the hawkers as well.
Some of the libraries in my hometown also have this magazine for their
readers. Reader’s Digest is an American general interest family magazine which
is published monthly. Apart from United States, this magazine reaches to an
additional 40 million people of the world in more than 21 languages in well
over 70 countries. This magazine focuses on health, food, advices, Home and
housing, true stories, jokes, inspiring and funny incidents and many more
topics.  
  
The writing and presentation of the topics are very interesting and the
readers enjoy the contents of the magazine a lot. This is an interesting
magazine because the way it presents its content is interesting. The humour,
the true stories, the jokes, the feature articles are very interesting to
read. One can enjoy and learn from this magazine at the same time. In fact it
is the most popular paid magazine circulation in the world with a huge number
of readers worldwide.

like&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an advertisement you like.

**You should say:**

  * what type of advertisement it is
  * what product it advertises
  * where you first saw it

**And explain why you think this advertisement is effective.**

**Model Answer 1: **  
There are several advertisements that we see in TV daily and some of them are
very boring and others are average while some are very interesting and
creative. One such advertisement that I really liked was regarding the
unmatched contributions of mothers for their kids which I saw few months back.
The advertisement was broadcasted for the 'Mother's Day' and it was not for
any product. The ministry of child &amp; mother care of health department was
the sponsor of this ad and I saw it 3-4 days before the last 'Mother's Day'.  
  
This ad was a very creative one and it was not like the most other ads that
publicize the advertize their products. Rather it was an advertisement
dedicated to the mothers and it reminded us that the toughest job of the world
is the job done by mothers. They take care of their kids with the utmost care
and dedication. They sacrifice their own wished and will to properly bring up
the kids.  
  
I saw this ad in the (...say a channel name..) UR TV channel. This was a
creative ad that effectively delivered the message it intended to. It has
shown some successful person in the history at the end and before that it
showed how mothers are taking care and inspiring their kids to do good things
and in the end it shows the tribute to the mothers of the world for their
valuable and second to none contribution.

**Sample Answer 2: **  
There are several types of advertisements that we see daily on TV, billboards,
through Internet, social networking sites, mobile applications, and mobile
games. Many of them are very banal, full of marketing speech and kind of
boring while others are average and their primary focus is to express the
positive sides of a product to increase the sales. Finally quite few of them
are creative, informative, humorous, fascinating and memorable.  
  
I usually do not like to watch advertisement between a movie/ TV programme and
large commercial breaks are quite annoying to me. I personally think that the
best way of advertising is using billboards, which can lead you to remember
the brand name forever without actually annoying you.  
  
Well, the best advertisement I have ever seen that I still like for its
uniqueness was in a main road in the United Arab Emirates and I really liked
the idea of this advertisement. One day while passing the main road a big
billboard caught my eyes. It was designed to look like the filtration zone of
a cigarette which is commonly known as the cigarette butt. The large billboard
was quite different in shape and it presented the message ‘Stop smoking even
Marlboro’ quite visibly.  
  
I stole a glance at the billboard and thought about the message it conveyed. I
actually did not think much and forgot about it. After an hour I found myself
in front of a beach with a packet of Marlboro cigarette in my pocket. While I
was lighting a cigarette, I was wondering why I bought a packet of Marlboro?
It is usually not my brand? To my surprise I realized that the advertisement
that I saw on the road had an immense effect on my psychology unconsciously. I
was convinced that the billboard had forced me to buy that brand
unconsciously. I think it was the first time I realized how advertisements can
target people's unconscious mind. Technically speaking this is the moment I
realized that the best way to influence people’s buying behaviour is to use
their unconscious mind instead of trying to deliver marketing speeches. When I
thought more to analyze the billboard advertising and its effect on me, I
realized that the advertiser tried to use reverse advertising techniques by
delivering the message that Marlboro is less dangerous and smokers who wish to
quit smoking should try this. Possibly all smokers- from light smokers to
heavy ones, wish a day without smoking though many of them do not try hard.
Then the billboard advertisement was pretending as if they were broadcasting
an important public safety message. Moreover they used a fascinating design on
the billboard that would actually grab anyone's attention. As you can see,
they were quite successful as I still remember this advert very vividly and I
like this advertisement due to the creative thinking of the maker.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a cyber cafe in your locality.

**You should say:**

  * What type of place it is
  * What do you do there
  * Describe the cafe

**and explain why it is an important place for people.**

**Model Answer:**  
With the ever increasing popularity of internet and people's dependency on
that for various reasons, the need for cyber cafe has grown and as a result
cyber cafes can often been seen in different places in our city. To meet the
rapidly increasing demands of internet use, email and printing people nowadays
visit the nearby cyber cafe often, Those who have arrangement of computer and
internet connections at home, they usually use internet at home but other
people go to those cyber cafes that offer a cheap rate for browsing internet,
printing, voice and video calling. One such cyber cafe in our locality that I
often go is named "Express Cyber Zone".  
  
This cyber cafe is only few minutes away from my home and offers a good
service. Their computer have good configuration and they offer a high speed
internet connection. The speed is 1 mbps and users who are ready to pay a bit
more can use even faster net which is 2 mbps. The decoration, environment,
sitting arrangement, privacy option and behaviour of the cafe staffs are good
and that's why they have some regular customers. For regular users they offer
a discount and they also have monthly membership card facility. The computers
are latest and they have IPS backup and per hour browsing rate is competitive.
For these reasons I mainly go to this cafe apart from using the internet at my
home. If I need some bulk printing, I go to that cafe and they offer a bulk
printing in a reduced price.  
  
Besides the internet browsing facility, they also offer printing, scanning,
computer servicing, fast food, tea, computer accessories etc. People mostly go
there to use internet and this place offer a good internet connection and also
offers a nice environment for internet browsing.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a garden you remember visiting.

**You should say:**

  * where it is
  * what it looks like
  * what people do there

**and explain why you remember it.**

**Model Answer: **  
I remember visiting a big garden at my uncle’s house when I was a college
student. The garden was so big and was so beautiful that I still remember it.
It was at my maternal uncle’s firm house and was adjacent to a narrow lake. My
uncle lives in a 4 storied building but he had a firm house and a very nice
garden that he looked after. This was a very good earning source for him as
well.

One day he invited me to visit the garden with him and I agreed to visit it. I
became speechless when I entered into the garden. It was at lease 2-3 acres
and had been placed beside a lake. A soft, balmy wind was blowing and the
flowers were dancing with the wind. I have never seen so many flowers together
that I watched in this garden. There were fence all around the garden to
protect it from savage animals.

There were several types of trees in this garden including flowers trees,
vegetable &amp; fruit trees and big trees to give shadows to other trees.

This was not a public garden so the entry was restricted for the people to
enter inside the garden. But I have noticed that people could easily come near
the garden as the lake was a public place. They enjoyed the beauty of the
garden from outside. The people who takes care of the garden water the trees,
cut of the unexpected branches of the trees, takes away the dust and rubbish
from the garden and keep close eye in the garden so that wild animals can’t do
any harms of it.

I remember the garden because it was so beautiful and was near the lake. The
several numbers of flowers in the garden and the chattering of the known and
unknown birds overwhelmed me. I was supposed to be there for an hour or so but
I was so much attracted to the beauty of this garden that I stay there for
several hours.

of-the-internet&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about the most important benefit of the internet.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * Why do you prefer it
  * How students can take advantages of it

**and explain what are the importance of it in your country.**

**Model Answer 1:**  
The computer and internet technology have been in introduced only few years
back compared to other widely used technology like mobile phone, satellite
etc. and yet the internet and computer have made a revolution the way we live
our life. There are very few sectors where internet is not used. This has
changed the way we communicate, present our business, and maintain our banking
and do shopping.  
  
Internet has bought countless benefits for us and in my opinion the ease of
communication it has made is the most important one for us. The previous way
of communicating via post mail, telephone and travelling were expensive and
time consuming. But internet has made it possible to communicate with others;
be it a personal communication or business communication, very easy. One can
send an email with rich media like video, image and multimedia presentation to
anyone in the world only in few seconds. The wide spread popularity of social
media networks like facebook and Google+ have made it possible to get
connected with friends, family members, colleagues and new friends very
easily. The smartphones with internet connection makes a business per son
available for 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. You get notification whenever
you get an email on internet calls.  
  
With the internet people can do business conference from different parts of
the worlds and that has help improving the way multinational companies
maintain their business. The social media would remind you your friends’ and
family members’ birthday so that you do not forget to wish and greet them and
thus internet helps us becoming more friendly and social.  
  
I prefer to use internet for several reasons: first it is available and cheap.
I can use internet at home, at office and even in the street. I can get help
on any topics, work or study related from the internet. It helps me getting
connected to my family members, relatives and friends. I do online shopping
and that helps me to save a significant time. The internet is probably the
richest knowledge center that can answer my queries and needs. This is a great
media for entertainment for me as I can find any music, movie or TV serial I
like to watch.  
  
The internet, as I already said, is the most opulent source of getting
information. Students can easily take advantages of learning from internet. In
fact most of the students already use internet as study references, use it for
completing their assignment and read books online.

Our country is a promising country for the IT sector and already a large
number of companies are working in this sector. This promising sector is
heavily depended on the internet connection. A large number of workforce is
depended on the internet connection, the eCommerce is primarily dependent on
internet and most of the offices and companies use internet for their
communication with other companies and clients. Thus our economy has
dependency on this technology.

Model Answer 2:

The internet is the most extraordinary thing!  I am old enough to remember a
time before even computers existed, let alone the internet.  It has brought
about many benefits, today I’m going to focus on the one I think is most
important.  I’ll tell you what it is, why I have chosen it and how it has
helped me and could help students too before finishing with trying to
articulate just why it is so important in my country, the UK.

The internet is an almost infinite resource.  You can use it to find
information on any topic – although the wise user is careful about the source
of information as just because it appears on a page online somewhere doesn’t
mean the information or advice is necessarily true or wise!  For me, the real
benefit of the internet, is the way it and put people in touch across the
world, communication and connectivity.  Not only through instantaneous
messages whizzing across the ether to people thousands of miles away that you
already know via email, but more extraordinarily through putting people in
touch with likeminded strangers.

When travelling this year, for the first time I kept a blog.  I was
astonished.  I had a ‘comment’ feature on the site, and people from all over
the world got in touch with me to give advice, offer feedback on what I’d seen
and said and share their own experiences of traveling and working overseas.
It was inspirational.  I thought travelling on my own would be scary and maybe
lonely at times, instead I found that there was a whole international
community of well-meaning, like-minded people who were happy to travel along
with me – albeit virtually, and laugh with me at the highs and support me
through more challenging aspects.  It really opened my eyes to the
possibilities of building new international friendships with people who had
encountered my blog pretty randomly.  It was fantastic to access this group of
people, learn from them and enjoy their contributions.  It made me much more
confident in my adventures, I felt like I wasn’t alone.

The internet sometimes gets a bad press in terms of the dangers of social
media and the need to be cautious about who you meet online.  That is probably
true in some instances.  However, my experience was wholly positive.  I felt
that these friends from afar that I have only ever met online, provide proof
positive that there are more kind and helpful people in the world than not.
You simply have to open your heart and mind to the possibility of
communication and connection and take it from there.  The internet facilitates
that for everyone who can access a cyber café or internet signal wherever they
are in the world.

Students - like everyone else – can exploit this.  Whether that’s by carrying
out original research from talking to someone active in an online forum about
a particular topic, accessing an expert opinion from a specialist blog or from
getting in touch with fellow students to offer each other peer support around
difficult subjects.  The internet is at its best when, rather than being used
for passive searching for information, it is used to actively engage with
other users.  Discussion, debate, sharing experiences, all have value.

For my country, the UK, the internet has revolutionised how connect with one
another.  The same is true of course for all countries.  However, perhaps it
could be argued that as an Island, the ability to communicate so effortlessly
across continents is even more important.  Being an island no longer means
being isolated.  We have come a very long way from the times when sending a
letter could take weeks by sea or many days by air.  The only other
alternative being to make a ruinously expensive phone call and keeping your
fingers crossed that your intended contact would be in when you called.  As
for reaching out to a complete stranger ‘someone somewhere’  – I think the
nearest equivalent pre the internet might have been to write a letter, put it
in a bottle and cast it into the sea!Times have certainly changed!

to-travel-to&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a place that you would like to travel to.

**You should say:**

  *     Where you would like to go
  *     How you would go there
  *     Who you would go with

**and explain why you would like to go to this place.**

**Model Answer: **  
I had a very close friend in my school level who is currently working as a
doctor at (_...say a place name..._) and I would like to travel to his living
place. I have a plan to visit (...say the place name...) whenever I will get
holidays for 4-5 days. The friend has invited me to visit his place and in the
mean time he has visited my place twice. So my turn to visit his place has
become mandatory. As he is living in a rural area where hills, tea gardens are
available, I am sure I will enjoy my visit there.  
  
There are three options to visit the place: bus, train and airplane. For me
the airplane would be bit expensive and I like traveling by train, so I will
take the train to visit there.  
I have few reasons to visit this particular place. First of all, this area is
famous for its natural beauty and a good number of local and foreign tourists
visit this place each year. I would be able to enjoy my stay and live close to
nature during my stay there and that would be a goof refreshment for me.
Second, I would enjoy my friend's accompany there and as he has already
visited my place twice, I feel kind of obliged to visit his living place.
Another reason I would like to travel there is to stay away from the busy life
and busy city for dew days.

**Alternative Answer: **  
I have a great desire to visit the Vatican City and that’s a wish I would like
to fulfill. The Vatican City is a comparatively small area and I want to visit
all the major places of this country. Since I live in _(…say your country
name…)_ and would require a visa to enter the Vatican City, airplane would be
the most convenient transportation for me. From the airport, I would need to
hire a taxi and I wish to travel the Vatican City either in a rented car or on
foot. I do not have any particular plan to take a friend or a family member
but a good companion would not b a bad idea. Someone who has interest in
History (especially on Vatican City) would be a good company for the journey I
guess. Right now I can think of _(…say a friend’s name…) _as my travel
companion in this journey.

I have a great interest about the mysteries and history of Vatican City. The
places, the artworks, the buildings, the archives and many other interesting
historic events of this city make it a great attraction to millions of
tourists of the world. I want to take the first hand experiences of the
historic events I heard, read and learned about this city. The places and
monuments of this city were described in lots of book I have read and the
movies I have watched. I would like to go there to witness the greatest works
of famous painters, architects and leaders. My interest in history, art and
mystery are the main reasons for my interest to make this travel to Vatican
City.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

Q. Why do people need to travel every day?

Q. What problems can people have when they are on their journey, for example
to work or school? Why is this?

Q. Some people say that daily journeys like these will not be so common in the

Q. Can travel make a positive difference to the economy of a country? How?

Q. Do you think a society can benefit if its members have experience of
travelling to other countries? In what ways?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a club you organized or involved.

**You should say:**

  * What type of club it is
  * What is your involvement there
  * what do you do for it

**and explain why it is important to you.**

**Model Answer:**  
Besides my study, I am an active member of the "Youth Knowledge Club" in my
area and I do actively participate on different programs they organize. This
is basically a club that encourages people to read books and does some social
welfare. The members pay only a small amount of fees and the rest of the money
comes from a larger NGO. The members attend the club every Sunday from 10.00
am to 12.30 pm and discusses on different social, environmental issues. Some
cultural activities also help on and these are mainly conducted by the
members. The members of our club enjoy the advantages of taking books to home
and to contribute to the betterment of the youth, education, social and
cultural aspects.

I am a member of this club for the last 5 years and because of that I have the
access to a very rich library they have I take books home every week and
because of my involvement in the club, I have been able to read books by
various writers and topics. This has definitely helped me learning new things
and to enhance my knowledge. Apart from that, I take part on some cultural and
social works they do and that helps me being active in my social activities.
In several occasions we have distributes free books to poor kids, helped
people in natural disasters and I have been able to do so because of my
involvement in this club.

Most of us feel to help those who are in need but sometimes it is not possible
to reach them alone. Being involved in a club that mainly focuses on aid for
people is a great way of helping others. That's why my involvement with this
club is very important to me.

**Alternative Answer:**  
Many years ago when I was in high school, I organized a club with some of my
friends and neighbours. As I recall we named it as NAVIGATOR. We organized
this club with the aim to collect donation for the flood/ cyclone/ earthquake
and other natural disasters' victim. This was actually aimed to help the
people and the club was kind of charity and donation collecting organization.
Apart from that, we established a night school for the street children and a
library for the club members.

I was actually a founding member of the club and I spent a long time to
establish the club and to make it a helpful organization for the people. To my
great surprise this club was reported in a news program in TV and watching
that was a great feeling for me. I did lots of things there including donation
collection, members’ authorization, taking classes in the night school,
conducting meeting etc.

As it was a club that I got involved from the very beginning, it became
actually a part of my life. This club gave me the opportunity to do something
good for the poor and suffering people. I felt great by contributing in this
noble task and this club brought me this opportunity. As a founding member of
the club and active member of it, I found it very much important for me.

clothing&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your favorite item of clothing.

**You should say:**

  *     What it is
  *     When you bought it
  *     Why you bought it

**and say why you like it so much.**

**Sample Answer 1: **  
Ooh, favourite item of clothing!  I’m not much of a clothes horse to be
honest, I’m not very interested in fashion so at first I thought this topic
might be quite hard.  However, I’ve thought of one.  I’ll tell you what it is,
when and why I bought it and why I like it so much.

The item is in itself unremarkable.  It is a purple craghoppers’ long-sleeved
shirt.  It is made of a quick-drying poly cotton blend and the fabric has some
stretchy qualities which make it easy to wear.  The fabric keeps out the sun,
and the design incorporates a couple of pockets, one of which has a zip so you
can keep small items securely on your person.  It is designed as a travel
shirt, and to be honest, was rather expensive compared to clothes I would
normally buy.

I bought the shirt online ahead of travelling to South East Asia.  It was just
coming out of winter in the UK, but I’d be going to a hot climate.  I wanted
something lightweight and comfortable to take with me.  It was the wrong time
of year to be browsing shops in England, they were all still full of winter
clothes, so I just had to trust the description on the site that this would be
a good buy, but I was nervous in case it didn’t fit or wasn’t practical.  I
shouldn’t have worried.

I LOVE this shirt.  It is incredibly comfortable to wear, the colour suits me
quite well, and even though it is designed as a travel shirt, it’s actually
smart enough to wear for work if you match it with some respectable trousers
(or a skirt I suppose, but I never wear skirts!).  It washes brilliantly, and
if you shake it out and put it on a hanger it dries crease-free within an hour
or so.  The hidden pocket is handy for carrying emergency cash on your person,
and I like to have a hanky with me too – there is a pocket for that as well.
Because the shirt is so comfy, and much harder wearing than I expected, I wore
it almost all the time on my travels.   This means that the shirt is now
linked to very many happy memories of places I’ve been, people I’ve met and
adventures I’ve had.  I wish I’d bought loads of them at the same time.  I’ll
be heart-broken when it eventually wears out as one day it surely must.

Talking about it has got me thinking – would it really hurt to have another
quick look at their travel clothes website once again?  You never know,
perhaps they’ll have a sale on and it would be shame to miss out...

**Model Answer 2: **  
I purchase my own clothes most of the time and there are many dresses I really
like to wear and among them the leather jacket that I have is my most
favorite. This is a brown colored stylish jacket that I purchased 2 years ago.
I bought it from an expensive brand shop which mainly sells winter dresses.

After I moved to the capital city, I found my old winder dresses to become
backdated and I was planning to purchase a new one. The jacket I bought is
really a favourite piece of clothing I have in my collection. I bought it
mainly because I needed a new cloth for the winter season and this one looked
very stylish and seemed like made by good materials. I wandered in several
shops and markets and was having a hard time finding a stylish and good
looking jacket. All of a sudden this one caught my eyes and after trying it in
the trial room, I instantly decided to purchase it.  
  
I wear it only the winter season and this jacket gives me warmth I need to
protect from the chilly and cold weather. I like it very much as it goes with
my choice and need. Some of my friends appreciated this piece of cloth and
they inquired where I purchased it from. I can wear it with both the casual
and formal dresses and that gives me a good advantage. Besides fashion, this
cloth offers utilitarian values as well. I feel comfortable and protected in
this dress and it did not cost me a lot.

I don’t have a huge collection of dresses and I do not purchase dresses that I
would not wear. But sometimes I find myself in dilemma when I purchase a dress
and later on find it very ordinary. But this leather jacket was exceptional. I
have felt a great joy after I purchased it and still this is the best winter
jacket I have. For all those reasons this dress has become my most favourite
piece of cloth I own.

been-made&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a book on which a film has been made.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * which one do you prefer? why?
  * What is the story of it

**And explain why do you think the book was a good one/ bad one.**

**Model Answer 1:**  
So, today I’m going to talk about a book that has had a major influence on me
and based on which a movie was made.  I will first tell you the name of the
book, then I’ll tell you how I heard about it, next I’ll outline the main
story and finally I will explain why it plays an important role in my life.

The book is called ‘Tracks’, and it is by an Australian woman called Robyn
Davidson.  It’s quite old now, I think it was written in about 1980, but it
has recently been made into a film, so perhaps you will have heard of it.

I was introduced to the book by an Australian friend.  She was traveling in
England when I met her, and we were both working at the same place.  I said
how brave she was going round the world, and how much I’d like to do it but I
didn’t have the skills and courage to do the same.  She insisted that bravery
doesn’t really come into it, sometimes you just have to go.  When she left to
continue on her travels she gave me a copy of this book, with an inscription
that was taken from its last chapter which basically says, the hardest part of
any endeavour (or journey) is taking the first step, making the decision to
go, and after that it’s easy!

The book is a true account of a young woman who decides to cross the Great
Australian Desert on her own by camel!  That is some 1700 miles of Australian
outback, from Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean.  What I found remarkable
about the tale, is that the woman who does this is herself not that well
equipped.  She makes lots of mistakes, things go wrong, she loses confidence
at times, and it is by no means easy.  At the start of the journey she’d never
met a camel, let alone knew about how to work with them!  However, she
overcame all these obstacles through tenacity and creativity and achieved her
goal.  It was precisely because she was apparently so unsuited to the
endeavour that I found it really inspirational to read.  Sometimes you read
tales of adventurers and the people who do great thing seem to be super-human,
incredibly resourceful, strong or wealthy and you end up thinking ‘that’s
amazing, but I could never do that’. With Robyn’s tale it is different, you
think ‘well if she can I could too.  It won’t be easy, but it isn’t
necessarily impossible either’.

So why is the book so important to me?  Because it gave me a nudge to do
something I’d been wanting to do for a very long time.  To travel.  The story
inspired me, but also the confidence that my friend had in me that I could do
it too helped me to eventually take the decision to go off exploring the
world.  Perhaps not anything quite so remarkable as crossing a desert on my
own apart from a few camels, but my own adventures nevertheless.  Since then
I’ve found out for myself that it is indeed true, the hardest bit about any
adventure is making the decision to take the first step.  I wouldn’t say that
after that it is necessarily easy, but I would say if you keep going forward
you won’t want to look back!

**Model Answer 2:**  
I can remember many movies that I have enjoyed and which were actually based
on books that I have read. One such book was ‘The Notebook’ which was written
by Nicholas Sparks and later in 2004; a movie with the same title was
released.  
  
I read the book in 2002 and thoroughly enjoyed it because of the attractive
story line. The Notebook was the first published book by Nicholas Sparks and
because of the big success of this novel, the writer got internationally
acclaimed. This book was published in 1996 by the Time Warner Book Group and
got in the list of the New York Times best selling books with in the first
week of its release. I preferred the Book version of the story as it was
touchier and more vivid than the movie version. The book tells the story in a
tone that was not present in the movie. The movie making was good as well but
the story that I read was more enjoyable as I have read each line of the story
and had the control how fast to read it, when to pause it and when to think
about it.  
  
The story of the book starts with an old man who reads story to an old woman
each day in a nursing home. The story he reads the woman was the story of Noah
and Allie. After 2nd World War, Noah came back and restored a house that made
a news in the newspaper. Allie read this news and gave him a visit. This was
their second encounter after 14 years when at their adolescence time; they
fall in love with each other. They were separated by the social class as Allie
was the daughter of a rich man. In the second encounter with Noah, Allie felt
that she still loves Noah but she also does not want to hurt her fiancé. At a
later date, her mother arrives and hand over the letters of Noah that she
never gave to her daughter. Allie started crying and left for her hotel when
Noah tried to convince her to stay.  
  
The old man who was telling the story was Noah and the old woman was Allie who
had memory loss and did not recognize her husband. On a dinner, old woman told
him that Allie must have gone back to Noah and they are together now. Later
on, Allie recognized her husband and could remember the past while in the
nursing home and the story ends with the victory and joy of love. The writing
quality, the story line, the plot and other ingredients of the book were
interesting and attractive. I personally enjoyed the book a lot.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 137 - Talk about something that you have made by

made-by-yourself&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about something that you have made by yourself (from wood, metal,
paper or other material).

**You should say:**

  * What you made.
  * Why you make it.
  * How you make it.

**and explain how you felt about it.**

**Model Answer: **  
I usually made toys in my childhood and sometimes I made some electronic
devices in my teen age and those were very exciting for me. I felt overwhelmed
whenever I had been able to make something that I aimed for. I would like to
talk about the wooden boat I created in my childhood when I was 8 or 9 years
old.

I saw a very nice looking boat in a toy store and had been fascinated to have
it. But the price was too high for me and I did not ask my parents to buy it
for me as I knew that it was very expensive. Few days later after my 5th grade
final exam I went to visit my grandfather’s house and planned to make a boat
similar to the boat I saw in the store. The original boar that I saw was made
by metal and plastic but I planned to make one using board, wood. The plan
came to my mind as the woods and boards were available in my grandfather’s
house.

  
I started making the boat from my memory and found that I was making the wrong
one and I won’t be able to make the boat that I planned. I made a sketch and
then started building the parts. This time I was successful and I had been
able to make a nice looking boat. Later I coloured it and wrote my name on it.
This was a fascinating experience as it was the first time I made something
from wood and board. Before that I mostly made toys from papers and after I
made the boat, I showed it to everyone. I was very excited to have it and I
was proud that I had been able to make it. I had this toy with me for one year
or so this was a toy that inspired me to make some other toys that I made
later on.

take-if-you-have-time&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a course you would like to take if you have time.

**You should say:**

  * what kind of course it is
  * where you would do this course
  * how you would take this course

**and explain how you would benefit from taking this course.**

**Model Answer: **  
If I get time I would like to learn the computer graphics designing course. It
is a combination of learning some theoretical aspect of graphics designing and
then hands on Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. These two are widely used image
editing and graphics designing tools that emphasizing on computer design and
website designing.

I would like to get admitted in (_...say an institution name..._) who offers a
professional course on graphics designing. They have a good reputation of
teaching the course participants accurately and effectively. Since I have
offices/ classes till the evening, I would like to enroll in the evening
course that starts after 7.00 pm. The course fee is reasonable and I would
have the option to pay the fees in 3-4 installments and that would be very
convenient for me.

  
This should not be a very difficult course for me as I already have some
background on computing and graphics designing. But I will have to concentrate
on the course and maintain the regularity. This course would be a 6 months
course and that's why I will have to adjust my time during this 6 months
period. Another thing that required a course participant is to practice a lot.
Since this is a creative task and the course teacher would show us how to do
something, the course takers have to work hard to improve their skills and
creativity.

  
This course would be helpful for me to do better in my career. Graphics design
is required for many jobs and knowing it would be a great advantage for me.
Besides, If I can become a prominent graphics designer, I would be able to
work for clients from different countries as a freelancer beside my day job.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a special occasion in your life.

**You should say:**

  * where this occasion took place
  * when it occurred
  * who was there

**and explain how you felt on this special occasion.**

**Model Answer: **  
There are many events and occasions in my life which I treat as important
events and among them my admission to the _(...say your university name...)_
was a very special occasion for me. Since the university is located in
_(...say a city name...)_ I would say this occasion took place there. I got
admitted in this university in 2004 and I had to compete with several other
students to be accepted. It is one of the most famous university and for a
single position, more than 20 candidates compete.

My future career, what I will do, where I will be and what I will become would
be shaped by this event. If I had been admitted in a different university in a
different faculty, things in my life would have been different. That's why I
consider this event as a very significant event in my life. When I came to get
admitted in the university, my father was with me.

  
As I have already told this was a very important occasion in my life as it
would shape my future and what I become. I felt very overwhelmed when I got
admitted in this university. I felt proud to be allowed to study there, and my
parents were very proud as well. I felt bit sad that I would have to leave my
family afterward but I knew that was for greater purpose. I felt that a
different part of my life is going to start and I was determined to follow the
right track with time.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a film based on a real life event or real person.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * What is the story
  * What did you learn from it

**and explain why it is a good/ bad movie.**

**Sample Answer:**  
‘A Beautiful Mind’, a film that was released in 2001 from Hollywood, was based
on the story of a real person named John Nash. The movie was directed by Ron
Howard and he was inspired to make the movie from a book of the same title.  
  
The famous actor Russell Crowe acted as the main character of the movie and
won the Oscar for the best actor. The story of the film depicts the life, work
and thinking of a young prodigy called John Nash who developed a paranoid
schizophrenia after he joins the secret cryptography work. The true genius,
the talented and gifted person who had difficulties separating the
hallucination and reality worked towards defining the mathematical
relationship that changed the world. Nash lived two separate lives and one was
in his mind while other one was the real one. This film portrayed the life and
work of a genius who had some mental illness and yet contributed for the
betterment of the world.  
  
The movie told us the story of John Nash who is an interesting person in terms
of his genius and talent. The acting, the production and presentation of the
movie was extraordinary. It was so nicely presented and acted that majority of
the critics gave positive review of this movie just after it was released.

##  Describe someone you know who made a wrong decision.

**You should say:**

  * who the person was
  * what the situation was
  * what decision they made

**and explain why you think it was the wrong decision.**

**Model Answer:**  
My friend Robin made a wrong decision that I still do not support and feel
sorry for. Robin is one of my close friends whom I met in my elementary
school. After that time, he has become one of my very good friends.  
  
He has a natural talent of art and his arts and sketches have been highly
praised in different art competitions. I remember he won the first prize in an
art competition when he was only 12 years old and in this competition there
were many matured competitors from university level. I was a great admirer of
his arts and I always knew he would become a great artist some day.  
  
But to my wildest surprise, after he passed the board exam, he got admitted in
B.B.A instead of art school. That was indeed shocking news for me and I could
not believe the news after I heard it. I thought that he was destined to be a
famous artist. May be he was pressurizes by his relatives and parents to take
such a wrong decision. To me that was a fatal error he has ever made.  
  
It was a wrong decision because he has chosen a major for study which would
not be interesting and attractive to him. He has not taken this decision
wisely and have considered about getting a better job instead of nurturing of
a natural talent he has. In the long run, he would regret his decision and I
still find no reason of his taking such a wrong decision about his life.

country&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a sport in your country.

**You should say:**

  * What sport it is
  * Is it well developed in your country
  * What is the most popular sport there? Why?

**And explain how the sport/ game is played.**

**Model Answer:**  
Football is a very popular sport in our country and a great number of people
play this game. In terms of popularity and people's love for football, I would
say it is well developed in my country. We have some major football leagues
each year and big teams participate in these games. The number of people who
watch the game in stadium and on TV is huge. The ordinary people play this
game in the morning and evening and they really enjoy it. Most of the people
of our country know the rules of this game and they play it whenever they get
time.  
  
Though a large number of people play football in our country, cricket is the
most popular game here. Our cricket team is one of the ten test cricket
playing team in the world and they also play in the cricket world cup. The
teenagers and young people mostly play cricket and people of all stages enjoy
this game as our team plays in world cup and in major cricket tournaments.  
  
Football is the second most popular game in my country and we have several
millions spectators who enjoys major football premier leagues and the football
world cup.

Two teams participate in a football game and each team has 11 players on their
side. One of these 11 players is the goalkeeper who always tries to protect
the goal bar. Rest of the players play in different parts of the fields
namely, defense, mid-fielding, attacking-position etc. and their aim is to put
the ball into the net of the opponent team’s goal bar. There is a refry and 2
line-men to ensure the rules of the games and players get green and red card
for foul play. The team that can get more goals would win the match. The
length of the game is 90 minutes including a short interval and the teams
interchange the position of the field after the interval. This is probably the
most popular game in the world and people in our country have great passion
for this sport.

make-to-your-life-in-the-future&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a change you would like to make to your life in the future.

**You should say:**

  * what the change is
  * when you would like to make this change
  * how easy or difficult you think this change might be

**and explain why you would like to make this change.**

**Model Answer: **  
In the future I would like to get admitted in a reputed foreign country and
complete my education there. After that I would get involved in a research
based job and after working for few years I would return to my country. This
would be a big change for me as I am currently working in a local company have
no prospect of getting involved in research based work.

The whole change would take quite few years and hence I want to start it right
from the next year. The first stage is to make this change happen is to get
admitted in a reputed foreign university. I will start that in few months
hopefully.

  
This is not a quite easy change as it requires hard work, determination and
bit of favor of luck. But I am positive that if I work on with determination
and follow the steps required, it would not be very tough for me.

  
I want to get involved in an area of our country where I would be able to
contribute greatly. And to contribute in such a sector I would require
experience of working in research based sector. In my opinion, studying in a
foreign country and then working in research projects would give me a good
insight of the sector I want to contribute. Besides, that would be a great
opportunity for me as well to get to know the different cultures and learning
many new things that would be helpful for me to contribute in our country.

vacation&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your idea of a perfect vacation.

**You should say:**

  * Where would it be?
  * Whom would you go there with?
  * What would you do there?

**And explain why it would be a perfect vacation.**

**Model answer: **  
A perfect vacation in my opinion would be a vacation that would be thoroughly
enjoying and refreshing. First of all, there would be a planning for the
vacation and would be around for a week. This has to be a different type of
place that the vacation taker usually lives in. Usually people enjoy visiting
a place which has a great natural beauty, quiet, offers good stay and
enjoyable activities. So I would prefer a place near sea, hill, tea garden,
urban area with natural beauty or a historical place that offers a good
travelling route. The journey has to be smooth and there should be tours to
take the vacation takes to deferent places.

I would prefer wither my friends or family members to have such a great
vacation. If it is my choice, I would like to go to a far end of the country
or in a foreign city which offers a lot of different activities like hiking,
surfing, natural sceneries and an arrangement of comfortable stay. I would go
to the famous and attractive places there, hand out with my friends, take
photos, take part of the activities offered there, walk beside the open space
and enjoy the night from the roof top. I would stay at a quiet place and in
the morning I would go explore the area to know about the people, their custom
and culture.

  
This would be a perfect vacation mostly because it offers different activities
and different lifestyle which is always refreshing. A vacation is aimed to
recharge us and give us pleasure so that after we come back from the vacation,
we can concentrate our daily routine with a pleasant feeling. My idea of
vacation would give plenty of opportunity to enjoy and to be refreshed.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about something that you plan to do in life besides your work and
study.

**You should say:**

  * What do you want to do?
  * What should you do for your plan to come true?
  * Why do you want to do it?

**and explain how would you feel once you have achieved it.**

**Model Answer: **  
I have plans to visit different famous and historical places of the worlds
besides my work and study. I would start from my home country and would visit
all the major tourists’ attractions and historically famous places of my
country. Then I would visit the 7 wonders of different ages of the world and
then other famous places of Asia, Europe, Africa and America.  
  
This would not be an easy thing to accomplish as it would require a large
amount of money and free times and in fact there are several hundred places to
go and learn about. I would require to establish my own business and to make
sure that I have enough time and money to have my trips. I would start my own
business and work very hard to take it to the top level. That would take few
years and I will need to get some helps from my father as well. I would have
to be very hard working and prudent to achieve it.  
I want to do it because I have an unquenchable thrust to visit the famous
places and to learn about different customs and people. I want to explore the
world as much as possible.  
  
There is no end of the plan I have as our lives are limited for a certain span
of time and the number of places worth visiting in the world is really
enormous. But I won't plan to visit all the places but the most significant
and famous places only. Once this starts and continue going (let's consider
the fact that there is no end of it), I would feel very happy for every tour I
would have. I would be very happy and contended to have my plan come true.
That would be a truly amazing experience for me.

future&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a movie or book about the future.

**You should say:**

  * what is it
  * when did you watch it
  * how it is related to future

**And explain how it has depicted the future.**

**Model Answer: **  
Artificial Intelligence, also known as A.I., is a science fiction movie which
was about the future. This science fiction drama movie was directed and
produced by the famous movie maker Steven Spielberg and was released in the
year 2001. This movie was adopted from a short story and was a hit in the
American Box office.

I watched it at the end of the 2001 for the first time and later in 2012, I
watched it again with my family members. The movie plot was set to a future
time when the number of population was drastically reduced due to the global
warming and other natural disaster. As the name of the movie implies, the
artificial intelligence has flourished at that time and people produced robots
that exactly resembled the human. Not only they look like human, they act,
think and feel like human. The movie set the plot at a time that is yet to
come. The human like robots, their feelings, love, hatred etc are still is its
preliminary stage but the movie depicts the time when all of those have been
achieved.

  
The story line went on to further future, two thousand years later when the
humans are extinct and Manhattan city got buried under several hundred feet of
glacial ice. Then the super intelligence has evolved who could create a clone
of human from the DNA.

  
The movie depicted the future where global warming and other natural disasters
cased the dramatic decrease of the human. At a later state, the movie shows
that the humans are extinct and only highly intelligent powers exists. The
intelligence gets so powerful that they can create human from DNA. They become
interested in human and want to know about human to find the true meaning of
existence.



**Alternative Answer: **

I remember many books and movies that I enjoyed and were based on future
events and plots. I would like to talk about one such book that was written by
James Maroon. The name of the book was ‘The lonely planet’. In my opinion it
was one of the best books I have ever read about the distant future. I love
reading science fictions and this book was a very high quality science fiction
that I thoroughly enjoyed.

  
I read it 4-5 years ago when I was a freshman in the university. It was
probably 2010 when I bought this book and it took me around 2 days to finish
it. This book was a sure page turner and I could not concentrate anything else
while reading this book!

  
The story of the book begins in 2090 when the technology and outer-world
research is unbelievably advanced. The story of this book shows the event of
first encounter of humans with the aliens. In this story when human first meet
aliens, many of their unknown mysteries and questions about universe, time and
space get answered. On the other hand the alien civilizations get many of
their questions answered from the human life and spirit.

  
In the book the future is depicted when human become more technologically
advanced and enriched with necessary commodity. The society classification is
a new concept in this book and the way it presented seems pretty convincing
and realistic. It shows the reflection of Plato’s theory of society and unlike
other science fictions, it shows that the robots and other machines are
working hard to help humans and not fighting the human. The story shows that
the human at that time will become more liberal, peaceful, hard working, and
benevolent. They don’t need to worry about the basic needs as they are making
sure by the robots. The constructions, agriculture, farming, transportation,
productions etc. laborious jobs are done by the robots. Human do mostly the
research works and try to find an alternative to start a new colony for human
as the world is approaching to destruction.

  
I really enjoyed reading this book and in my opinion, the future
representation in this book is quite natural and realistic.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your dream job when you were young.

**You should say:**

\- What kind of job it was  
\- Where did you learn about it  
\- What kind of training/ skills are needed for that job  
  
**and explain why it was your dream job.**

**Model Answer: **  
When I was young, I wanted to work for a major airline company as a pilot. In
fact becoming a pilot who flies the giant airplanes/ aeroplanes was my dream
in my childhood.

I have heard about this job from my teachers and relatives in my childhood and
then I had a superficial idea about this job. When I was 15 or 16 years old, I
saw a documentary on the tasks the pilots do in Discovery channel that gave me
a clear idea of the jobs of a commercial aeroplane pilot.



Working as a pilot requires a very comprehensive training and to become a good
pilot one needs very good quality and skill sets. Usually the commercial
airline companies hires the candidates and then give them comprehensive
training, both theoretical and practical, and after a high hours of flawless
flying records the candidates are send to work for their jobs. The theoretical
parts teach them the different aspects of flying, route, safety and process
guidelines where the practical parts allow them to actually fly a real
aeroplane. They need to prove that they have gained sufficient skills to fly a
commercial plane before they are appointed to do the job.  


I was a fascination on flying the aeroplane in the sky. It was a thrilling job
to me when I was a young. Since different people of the family members started
giving me the idea of good careers and what I would become in the future, I
started speculating my own idea and I found the job of a pilot very exciting
and prestigious. I knew that being a pilot would allow me to visit different
countries across our boundaries and would allow me to meet different people
and these 2 ideas also attracted me toward this job. For all those reasons it
was my dream job when I was young.

had&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a success you have had.

**You should say:**

  * what it was and when it happened
  * why you chose this area of activity
  * how easy or difficult it was to achieve

**and explain how important this success was.**

**Model Answer: **  
The success I think I am proud of is my outstanding performance in the board
final exam that I attended many years back. I got the highest mark in our
locality and because of that I got many congratulations and this success story
was reported in the local newspaper.  
  
It was the year 2002 (...say a year that suits you...) when I passed my school
board final exam. I can't recall the exact month the result was published but
that would be either January or February.  
  
Since the success was a part of my academic study and exam and not related to
any extracurricular activity, I would say it happened naturally and I had no
involvement in choosing it. To say more specifically, if someone achieves some
successes in photography or in art, s/he has some history how and why she came
to photography or art, what was the motivation etc. but for me that success
was an academic success and I did not have to choose anything. I needed to
study attentively though. I followed a rigid study routine for couple of years
and that helped me achieving this success. I would that that was easy to
achieve as I had a planned routine that I followed and I enjoyed reading my
academic lessons. I have devoted a great deal of time reading academic books,
reference books, different magazines related to subjects, took note, did group
discussions and other activities and all those activities helped me to achieve
this success.  
  
This was an important success for me as it highly inspired me to do better in
my further academic years. This success gave me the impression that if I can
do better, my hard work would be rewarded accordingly and I would be in a
better position in my future. Thus this success inspired me to achieve next
success.

visit&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a cyber cafe you often visit.

**You should say:**

  * where it is
  * what you do there
  * how often do you go there

**And explain the importance of cyber cafe.**

**Model Answer: **  
I often visit a cyber café which is in our locality and offers a good
environment for the customers and net surfers. The name of this cyber café is
‘Express Café and Cyber Zone’ and it is few minutes away from our house.

It is in the 3rd floor of the ‘Shoppers Heaven Market’ and at the back side of
the floor. I often go there to use internet and take print out. Though I have
internet connection at my home, but I often go there if my internet connection
is not available or if I need to take printing of important documents. I
usually go there 2-3 times in a week and enjoy the environment they offer.
Sometimes I go there to purchase some computer accessories like USB cable, DVD
and CD disks etc.  
  
With the expansion of internet, computer technology and online communications,
the need for cyber café has also enhanced. People often need to surf internet
for many different reasons; simply from chatting with friends till applying
for jobs or talking with an overseas relatives. Things are getting online
nowadays and the old way of communications, mailing, talking, applying for
jobs or even maintaining the banking transactions are rapidly getting online.
One need to use internet from checking and sending email till booking flight
and that’s why we need to use internet every now and then. But all of us do
not have easy access of internet at our home and that’s why we need to go to
the cyber cafes. We never know when we will need to send or check our emails
and sometimes the urgency requires us to use internet immediately. That’s
where the cyber cafés play an important role. They have all the arrangement of
using internet and we can use it by paying the hourly bill which is not
expensive at all. We need to take printouts of important documents, scan those
or even attach them in the emails and we can easily go to a nearby cyber café
and do those short of works.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a situation when you were late.

**You should say:**

    What was the event you were late for  
    What was the reason that you were late  
    How did you feel about it

**and explain how did you handle it.**

**Model Answer: **  
The city I live in has a severe problem of traffic jam and due to that we
often get late. One such event when I was late in an important exam was a
frustrating experience for me. It was 2 years ago when I was a student of the
university. I had an exam at 8.30 am which I thought would be at 9.30 am. I
did this mistake because I noted the time wrong in my notebook. I prepared for
the exam well and left home at 8.15 am as my usual journey to my university
takes around 40 minutes. According to the schedule, I should have reached at
least 30 minutes before the exam time.

I already had wrong idea about the exam timing and over it I found that it was
raining outside and there were very little transportation available in the
road. I had to stand at the bus stoppage for more than 30 minutes before I
actually got into a bus. To my surprise, the traffic on the road was very bad.
The bug was moving very slowly because of the unavoidable traffic jam. I was
hopping desperately to reach the university in time. But that was not my day!
I reached at the exam hall at 10.15 am and I was shocked to learn that the
exam would end only in 15 minutes. I was so worried and anxious that I could
not think clearly what to do.



I felt helpless at that time and was asked the teacher what can I do now. He
asked me to come after the exam ends. I followed him as soon as he left the
exam room. I noticed that some of my classmates were also looking at me with
surprise and were probably thinking how careless I was to miss such an
important exam.  


After I reach the class exam coordinator’s room, he took me to our advising
tutor and asked me to give a good reason why I was late for the exam. I told
everything that has happened and the coordinator arranged an exam in his room.
As a penalty he deducted 20 minutes from the exam time and asked me to finish
the exam and leave the answer sheet to him. I was kind of worried and felt bit
relived also. As my preparation was good, I had been able to answer all the
questions in the due time. Thus the situation was handled and I was not in a
big trouble for the late I made unintentionally.

food&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about your favourite food.

**You should say:**

  * What the food is
  * How it is made
  * Why you like it

**and explain why it is your favourite food.**

**Sample Answer 1: **  
I love food, so it is hard to think of just one favourite sort.  However, if I
had to choose, I can think of something that I like to have as a special treat
from time to time.  I’m going to tell you what the food is, how it is made,
why I like it so much and explain to you what makes it my favourite food and
maybe even convince you that you would like it just as much as well – if you
haven’t already discovered it for yourself.

The food is quite simple.  I’ve always thought of it as a Greek speciality,
although others tell me it actually originates from Egypt.  Can you guess what
it is?  Houmous.   I love it.  The food is spelt differently in American
English – they call it hummus and in British English we spell it with an ‘o’
and a ‘u’ as opposed to just the ‘u’ but the recipe is the same in either
case.

Basically, it ismade from cooked, mashed chickpeas blended with tahini, olive
oil, lemon juice, salt and garlic. It is popular throughout the Middle East
(including Turkey), North Africa (including Morocco), and in Middle Eastern
cuisine around the globe, but it is also extremely popular with me, although
I’m very particular about the sort I buy.  I live near a wonderful
delicatessen, it is run by a friendly couple, he is Italian and she is vintage
Yorkshire.  They make their own houmous with only the finest quality virgin
olive oil and huge quantities of the best fresh garlic they can get hold of.
It’s pretty expensive, but I love it, and it’s better than my own attempts for
some reason, I don’t know why, it shouldn’t be so hard to make.

Why do I like it?  I think it is partly the texture, and partly the taste, I
love garlic.  Also, because I’m vegetarian it is a very healthy food, with
lots of protein and quality fats that are good for you.  Of course you can
have too much of a good thing, but I think it’s well worth it.

It is my favourite food not only because it is absolutely delicious, but also
because you can share it with other people.  It is best eaten as a dip, with
friends.  I cut up lots of carrots, cucumber and celery into crudités
carefully sliced to make a colourful dish, perhaps with some slices of warm
pitta bread too.  A nice bottle of white wine helps.  We can then all sit
together enjoying the fresh humous dip, sipping our glasses of wine and
laughing and talking to put the world to rights.  It is a great way to enjoy a
fabulous food.

[ Written by -** Lucy Marris** | Careers Adviser (UK), TEFL teacher (Vietnam)
]

**Model Answer 2: **  
My favourite food is fried rice with vegetable and chicken curry with salad.
This is in fact the most popular menu in our country. The rice is first boiled
in water and then the boiled rice is fried with some chicken and vegetables
and oil. The chicken curry is prepared separately using some spices and
chicken and finally the salad is prepared using different vegetables and
fruits and then those are cup into pieces and mixed together with mustard.
Then these three items are served together.  
  
I eat this menu approximately 3-4 times in a week. This menu is prepared at
home mostly and sometimes I eat it in a restaurant. There are some variations
in the way this food is prepared and the ingredients using which this food is
made. Different restaurants have their own specialty in preparing and serving
this menu.  
  
This is my favourite food for many reasons: firstly it is very delicious and
healthy. This menu meets the demand for different food values our body needs.
It is available in most of the part in our country. Thirdly, I like it as it
offers the variations of tastes. Moreover, it is not that much expensive to
prepare and does not require o much effort to prepare. For all these reasons
it is my favourite food.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. Tell me about the types of food that people eat in your country.

Q. How are the eating habits now in your country different from eating habits
in the past?

Q. How healthy is your country’s food?

Q. Why do you think different cultures have different table manners?

Q. How may eating habits change in coming decades?

Q. How technology has changed the way we prepare our food these days?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a television programme you watched and did not enjoy.

**You should say:**

  *     what this programme was
  *     where and when you watched it
  *     what it was about

**and explain why you did not enjoy it.**

**Model Answer: **  
We usually do not watch TV programs that we not like and since we have lots of
channels to pick from, we change the channel as soon as we find that this is
not an interesting program. But sometimes we have to watch the program that
other people are watching and we do not have control on the channel changing
and thus we often watch programs that we do not like at all, one such program
was a talk show that I recently watched. This was a talk show in our national
TV channel (…say the name of a TV channel…) and apart from the host there were
two political figure who came from 2 opposite parties. Since this is a famous
TV channel, I am sure a good number of people watched it. I watched it at a
friend’s house when I was sitting at their drawing room and my friend’s uncle
was watching and controlling the TV channels.

The talk show was about a sensitive national issue and the starting was
interesting as the host of the program discussed in details about the program
and later on asked some interesting questions to the two guests. After 5
minutes or so, I got an impression that the talk show was scam and with this
program the Government is trying to give some misleading facts to the viewers.
The two guests started attacking each other and showed abominable attitude to
each others. That was so surprising that respectable people like them can
behave so abhorrently. The program went on and I found that I was completely
irritated to see such type of behaviors from our national leaders and the
feelings that this was a scam gave me nausea. I left the room before the
program ended and walked outside for about 30 minutes. After I returned I
found that the program ah ended and that was a kind of relief for me.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a time in your life when you were very busy.

**You should say:**

  * when it was
  * why  you were busy
  * how did you manage

**And explain what you did then.**

**Model Answer:**  
We all get busy in times of exam, sickness of a family member, for completing
assignment, to meet deadline etc. and though most of us wish to lead a relaxed
and hassle free life, the situation demands our promptness in action and we
all get busy then. One such busy time I still remember was the time when I had
the deadline to submit my thesis paper in the final year of my university.

I had about 2 months to complete the thesis and I killed almost 2 weeks due to
my job pressure. I joined a company as a part time employee at the beginning
of my final term and had to work for about 4-5 hours per day. I had classes to
attend, exams to prepare for, study and work at office. I had hardly few hours
remaining for my personal stuffs and I was worried that I was falling behind
my schedule for my thesis paper submission. The thesis was a complex one and I
had to visit libraries, browse internet, do group discussions and meetings and
brainstorm a lot to organize the writing for the thesis. Moreover I had to
visit some local offices to collect data for my thesis. Those days were so
tough and I had been so busy that sometimes I slept for 4 hours only at night.

The work pressure, tension, tight schedules, deadlines, moving from place to
place, classes &amp; study were my life. I did not visit my parents for the
whole semester as they were in my hometown. There were hardly any month that I
did not go to my hometown to meet my parents but during that period I did not
have the chance to do so. In fact I was unable to go to my hometown for about
7 months. I usually watch 2-3 movies in my computer each week, go for walking
each morning, visit some close friends, maintain my social networking profiles
and update my blog but during this period I was so busy that I did not do any
of these activities I usually maintain.

I am so lucky that I was finally completed the thesis and submitted it in due
time. To my surprise, I got a straight 'A' in my thesis, continued my job and
did well in my term final. But for that I had to sacrifice a lot and maintain
a strict routine. I slept 4-5 hours each day on an average, read academic
books and notes in public transportation while moving from one place to
another, and utilized every single hour I got. Moreover to finish things in
time I stopped lot of my other activities that I usually do. Thus I had been
able to handle the pressure and deadline. I have to thank some of my teachers,
classmates and some of my friends without whom it would have been impossible
for me to finish everything correctly and in time.

you-would-like-to-visit&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a place of natural beauty you would like to visit.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * Why would you like to visit
  * When would you like to visit

**And explain why it is a place worth visiting.**

**Sample Answer:**  
The natural place which I think is very beautiful and would like to visit is
(…say a place name you know is naturally beautiful…). It is a place that gives
the impression of natural beauty, serenity and divinity as it a vast green
area besides the hills and a beautiful river has passed besides it. The
flowers and fields are like scenery painted by a professional painter. The
butterfly, the birds, the bushes, the long trees and tea garden makes it a
place worth visiting.  
  
I have heard the impeccable beauty of this place from my friends and everyone
who went there has recommended it as a must visit place. I have also read few
articles about the tourist attraction and natural beauty of this place. The
writers describe it as a adventurous pace as hill tracking, swimming in the
river, visiting the lightened caves at night are all adventurous activities
that tourists mainly like to do there.  
  
I have a plan to visit this place in the near future when I would have a
vacation of more than 7 days. The local foods of this place especially the
fried fishes and shrimps are famous and that’s why I want to stay there for
few days. Most possibly I will visit this place next December.  
  
This is a worth visiting place because it is one of the greatest naturally
stunning and beautiful place. There are lots of activities to do, lots of
things to see and several famous menus to test. Since lots of people visit
this place and highly recommend it to others, I am sure this is a place that
worth a visit.

colour&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your favourite colour.

**You should say:**

•    what is it  
•    what is the significance of this colour  
•    how you started liking it

**and explain why do you like this colour.**

**Sample Answer 1: **  
I’m not sure I have just one favourite colour, but if you insist on making me
choose I know which one it would be.  I’m going to tell you what it is, why it
is significant and as far as I can how it is I started to like it.  I’ll try
and explain why I like the colour so much, but that might be hard to do –
liking a particular colour is after all a very personal thing.

My favourite colour is blue!  That doesn’t seem quite enough to say.  There
are so very many variants of the colour.  Sky blue; sea blue; azure blue; navy
blue; royal air-force blue; midnight blue; cobalt to name but a few.  Then
there are all those colours that are sort of blue, but tip over into green as
well like turquoise or teal.  To make it even more complicated there are rich
blues that might almost be purple like the colour of the iris flower in my
country.  If you go to a DIY store and pick up a colour chart for different
paints I expect there are hundreds if not thousands of ways to describe the
colour blue – and I don’t even know if we all see the colour in the same way.
It is mind boggling!

I don’t know quite what the significance of the colour is, but I find it a
really attractive hue.  In nature I love a clear blue sea, or the complex
blues of a sky.  Moody grey blue before a storm, dark midnight blue at dusk or
bright blue littered with fluffy white clouds on a summers day.  As a child I
pronounced at an early age that blue was my absolute favourite colour.  I
think I did it partly to be different, most girls were expected to like pink
but I wanted to dissociate myself from that and stubbornly declared a
preference for blue, traditionally a boy’s colour.  We used to go for walks
from my first school in a big crocodile of children.  We each held on to a
coloured ribbon that was attached to a long piece of rope, accompanied by two
teacher, one leading at the front of the rope and a second walking at the back
of the line to keep us all safe.  My classmates would fight for the pink
ribbon, but ‘my’ blue one was always free.  That helped me feel an affinity
for the colour from when I was very young.

As an adult I think the colour blue suits me to wear, particularly dark blues,
I look positively ill in paler colours for some reason.  I don’t know if that
goes anyway to explain why I still like the colour so much, perhaps vanity is
part of it.  However, I think the main reason has to be that I associate blue
with huge spaces, be that a great sea stretching out to the horizon or the sky
opening away to infinity.  Looking at that gives a sense of perspective, we
are such tiny beings in a vast universe, what could be more impressive a
colour than one that reminds us of that!

**Model Answer 2:**  
My favourite colour is green and I have loved this colour from my early
childhood. Green is the colour of nature, liveliness, fertility and freshness.
The first reason I like this colour is that the nature bears this colour
everywhere. There is nothing more beautiful than the vast green trees, green
vista and fields. Green is the symbol of life and it represents the safety.
The colour green also represents good luck, health, tranquility. This colour
has long been a symbol for fertility and that's why once been used in the
wedding gowns mostly in 15th century. This colour is often used in decorating
to show the calmness.  
  
If we judge the colour green from the colour psychology perspective, we learn
that green balances the heart and emotions and thus create the equilibrium in
heart and brain. From the meaning of colour perspective, green is the symbol
of growth, colour of spring and symbolizes renewal and rebirth. It is the
sanctuary away from the complexity and stresses of the modern lives and the
tranquility of the calm, fresh and greener area.  
  
I have my wall painted in green colour and it is generally believed that green
is an eye friendly colour unlike red. The mild green colour is a popular
colour which does not look too violent or too dull. I liked this colour even
in my childhood and that I can be sure from the dominant green usages in my
childhood paints. My teachers sometimes laughed at my weakness on green colour
when I painted a green sun and green moon. I still remember I pained a green
alien and that painting became very famous among our friends.  
  
I am not quite sure how my fascination started growing on green colour but I
guess I started liking this colour as I had spent my childhood in an area
where green was the most dominating colour. This was the colour of nature and
I was surrounded by the beauty of nature. I noticed in my childhood that green
is the colour for living and yellow and red means dying, specifically for the
trees and plants I had. May be this idea influenced my preference of colour.
May be this choice is not directly related to any of my experience and
reflected in a later stage as part of my individuality and personal
preference. Whatever is the reason, I guess Green is a colour of profound
importance and is my favourite colour.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about one of your long-time friends.

**You should say:**

  * when you first met your friend
  * what is s/he like
  * how the two of you keep in touch with each other.

**and explain why this friendship is important to you.**

**Follow-up Questions: **  
-   How do people make new friends?  
-  What do you think makes people have a long friendship?  
-  Does it make things easier in a friendship if you have similar interests? 

**Model Answer 1:**  
I have many friends and among them there are some friends whom I know for a
long time. One such friend is (...say a name of your friend...) and he has
many distinctive characteristics. I know him from my childhood and still I
value his friendship.  
  
He comes from a middle-class family and he has a natural talent of learning
everything very quickly. I met him for the first time in my school when he sat
near me. He had some distinctive characteristics and that's why I started
observing closely and later we became friends. Though he was very talented,
but he did not have the tendency to hold on to something for a long. He was
the most talented boy in our class but because of some whimsical decisions and
because of his priority to his own wishes, he does not have a bright and
prosperous career. He was a very good chess player, an excellent all-rounder
in cricket, a good defender in football, a tactical badminton player and the
quickest math solver in our class. Everybody thought he would become either a
math professor or an engineer and sometimes people thought that he would
become a good athlete, but he finally did his graduation in History as he
thought that this would allow him to learn a lot. After he finished his
graduation he learned some programming and designing and started his career in
Information Technology. He worked for 3 years in this sector and then all of a
sudden decided to leave this day job and work as a freelancer. As far as I
know he's been a good programmer and designer and in his freelancing career,
he is doing well.  
  
He often travels to different places and lead a life bit away from the
society. He has not married yet and I guess he has no intention to do so. He
is talented and sometimes whimsical.  
  
He is a close friend of mine and though we do not spend much time together, we
have a good bonding and we value our friendship. I know how much talented and
creative he is. I like his morality, talent, truthfulness, boldness, bravery
and his unquenchable thrust for knowledge and freedom.

**Cue Card Answer 2: **  
James is more than a friend to me. He is in fact my best friend and I like to
spend my time with him more than any other friend. He is one year senior to me
and I met him in my grade 4. On the first day of our class in grade 4, he sat
beside me and when I observed him being busy with something that was hidden in
his desk, I became curious about him. Next week I lent him one of my story
books and thus we knew each other. We are still friends and apart from some
very minor incidents, we have always been in good relationship as friends.  
  
He is working in a consultancy firm these days and planning to settle in
Canada with his family. On the other hand I am planning to complete my
Master's degree in a reputed UK university. We still try to meet each other in
our free time and have conversations about different issues and topics. Our
discussion includes our family, politics, books, works, films, music, our
friends and our plans for the future.  
  
I believe that James is bit different from others. While many other friends
got busy with their work and hardly communicated me, James on the contrary
always kept in touch. He even wrote me regularly when he was in a different
city. Thus our friendship became stronger with our regular interaction, mutual
trust on each other and due to our many common interests. We respect each
other, criticize each other if needed and always try to help each other.
Respect and trust in my opinion are two very strong elements for a strong
friendship and we never had any issue regarding these two. I consider him as
my best friend because I never have to pretend anything in front of him, I can
be quite myself with him and we can comfortably continue any conversation no
matter how different our views are on this.  
  
We were in the same class in school from grade 4 till grade 10. Then I got
admitted in a different school. However the 6 years when we were together in
school were some of the best years in our life. We were younger at that time
and everything were different then. There were numerous occasions when we did
exciting and interesting things that our parents would not have allowed us to
do. For instance, collecting frogs of various species in a large box, visiting
old buildings to find hidden treasures, fighting with other boys, visiting
theatre without informing anyone and swimming in the river without anyone's
knowledge were some activities we enjoyed together and knew none of our
parents would have permitted us to do.  
  
In our life we make different types of relationships and friendship is one
such important relationships that last forever. Good friends are like brothers
and sisters who will comfort you, guide you, criticise you if needed,
accompany you, encourage you, and help you in your rainy days. James is such a
friend who has done those all for me and is still a person I can rely on. He
is more like a family member to me than an outsider. Without any doubt he is
my best friend.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a piece of music that you like.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * Why you like it
  * How often you listen it

**and explain why it is a good piece of music.**

**Sample Answer: **  
The legendary song ‘Annie's Song’ by John Denver is a piece of music that I
really like. I like this song so much that every time I listen to it, I get a
fresh and inspiring feeling. This is probably the piece of song that I have
listened several thousand times.

This is a song that always inspires me and I like the lyrics and the music of
this song. John Denver and his band Beatles are always favourite to me and
their songs are in my favourite list. The ‘Annie’s Song’ is a piece of work
that the world will revere for a long. This is one of the most rated songs of
the world history and I like it for the magical tone it has. I listen to music
almost every day and this song is in my music player. So I would say I listen
to this music one in every two days on an average.

This particular song was sung by a gifted singer and the lyric is pretty
impressive. The music and vocal was just perfect to make it a legendary song.
I love it because of its appeal and magical power to me.

heard-about&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a fascinating job that you heard about.

**You should say:**

  * where you heard about it,
  * what kind of job it was,
  * what fascinated you, and

**and  explain why you thought it was fascinating.**

**Follow-up questions:**  
-  Was the job in question a well paid job?  
-  How the working conditions in your country have changed in recent years?  
-  What was the cause of the change?  
-  What benefits in your opinion do workers need, apart from salary?  
-  Does working too much have any influence on family life? 

**Model Answer:**  
One of the fascinating jobs that I heard about is "Game Testing". The game
testers test the computer, mobile and gaming device games. The game
development companies need the games tested before they actually release the
games. The game testers' job responsibility is to play the game and find any
inconsistency there might have.  
  
Testing is an important part of any software and game release and lots of
error, inconsistency and bugs are fixed during the testing phase and that's
why every game development company has its own testing team. I read about this
career few years back in a computer magazine and later I saw a documentary on
game testing in "Discovery" channel. I was fascinated about the job mostly
because it is interesting, challenging, creative, bit different than the
traditional 9 to 5 jobs, and offers lots of fun stuffs and recreations. Later
I searched in Google to learn more about this job and found some enchanting
facts and information about it. Some of these fascinating facts are:  
  
\- Game testers are highly qualified and computer graduates who have extensive
knowledge on computer programming, graphics, animation, design and testing.  
\- They enjoy a flexible timing for office. They are allowed to wear the
dresses they like.  
\- The salary they get are higher than many other sectors.  
\- To be a successful game tester someone needs good knowledge on computer
technology, keen eye and sharp brain.  
\- The work environment is different and they enjoy lots of flexibility.  
\- As the game industries are doing well and the market is expanding, the
future prospect for this job is promising.  
  
The game testing does not involve playing the games and get paid; rather it is
more challenging profession that requires particular skills and talents. And
for all these reasons this job seems very fascinating and interesting to me.

you-know&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

###  Talk about an interesting place that you know that is open to public /

###  An interesting place in your hometown.

**You should say:**

  * what kind of place it is,
  * who goes there,
  * why people usually go there

**and explain why you think it is an interesting place for people.**

**Possible Answer:**  
The rail station of my hometown is an interesting place that I know about.
There are several other interesting places I know about, but this rail station
is the place I've known for a long and in my childhood this seemed to me a
mysterious and alien place to me. The station is a large one and if anyone
observes closely, he will find lots of interesting and thought provoking
things there. The busy, crowd and noisy station is completely different from
the rest of the town. It is an usually calm town and has a harmony on
everything. On the other hand, the busy station is a gathering of lots of
known and mostly unknown people and this place gives a different impression
than the rest of the city. The place is covered with a very large and high
roof top and several overpass and roads, rail line, hawkers, beggars, workers
and large lorry have made the place a cryptic place. All of a sudden one day
one will find that the large bogies are gone and the place has been deserted.  
  
To me it is an interesting place because I have always found new people and
new things there. New hawkers and labors come there and stay for a while,
people come to receive their guests or relatives, polices are there to find
frauds and people who might visit without tickets. It is very usual that
sometimes people lose their important belongings and then search like mad men.
The people who come to say goodbye their friends, relatives bear a sad mark in
their faces. The happiness and sadness can be observed from their eyes, faces,
and way of talking and from the way they walk to home. This place is always
full of noise and the Sharpe whistle and siren of the train is louder than any
other sounds there. You will find it empty only if there is a strike of train.  
  
Interestingly this small place is a hub of so many different people of
different classes. Some come here to earn their livings, some to leave the
town and some with their relatives. The station employees, hawkers, labors,
beggars find it as their work place.  
  
The sign post with green and red light, endless rail-line, different people,
gathering, liveliness and sadness and many other things and reasons make this
place a really interesting place.

and my 3 others siblings. He spent his earning on our happiness and necessity
while he went through hardship. I learned the true meaning of life and started

yours&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a childhood hobby of yours.

**You should say:**

  * what hobby it was
  * how you developed this hobby
  * why you liked doing this

**and explain why you no longer have this hobby.**

**Model Answer:**  
In different stages of childhood and teenage time, different things attracted
me and some of the hobbies I had then are no longer present in me. One such
hobby of my childhood was collecting stamps.

I was a student of grade 4 when I first found that interesting hobby. I
noticed one of my classmates has a good collection of stamps and they were
cataloged based on country in his stamp book. The idea of collecting stamp
impressed me and I thought to start collecting the stamps as well.  


When I start collecting stamps I had no particular reason for doing so but the
idea of collecting stamps and having a good collection seemed an appealing
idea to me. But later I found that it is a good hobby that helped me knowing
many different cultures, persons, occasions and custom of my country and
foreign countries as well. For instance, after a found a stamp of USA that had
the Statue of Liberty printed on it, I asked my teacher about it and he
explained the details information of it. In another occasion I came to know
about Alfred Nobel, Marie Curie, Abraham Lincoln, Vasko da Gama etc. from the
stamps I had. The stamps also has many historical events or cultural events
printed on them and I learned about them as well. Some off the stamps were
from countries that I never knew about and thus the stamp collection habit
helped me extending my knowledge. Apart from that, I found that kids who
collect stamps have common interests and thus become close to other. One such
friend of mine was David whom I would have never met unless I had this hobby
in my childhood. In my childhood I liked this hobby mostly from pure passion
&amp; excitement and the opportunity to know about different events, famous
persons and events of history.  


I am not exactly sure how I abandoned this hobby later when I grew up but in
my best guess that would be because of my involvement in other stuffs,
interest in other things and business in school and study. I remember I had
the stamp collecting hobby till I was in grade 8 and later on I got busy in my
study, grown interest in computer technology, start playing outdoor games and
developed the habit of reading story books and novels.  


The stamp book I had in my school has been kept in a safe place by my mother
and who knows someday I will give it to my son/ daughter and s/he would start
collecting more stamps.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about your childhood teacher whom you want to meet.

**You should say:**

  * describe the teacher,
  * say what your relationship was
  * what did he/ she teach

** and in what ways the teacher was helpful.**

**Model Answer: **  
I was lucky to have so many talented teachers in my childhood and some of them
are still alive. I remember some of them very well and would like to meet some
of them if there are chances. One particular teacher whom I wanted to meet and
still would like to meet is Mr. Drabir who was the math teacher in our grade
4.

He was a tall man, well over 6 feet and was heavily built. He was much like an
athlete than a teacher. He used to take our math class and he had a great way
of teaching. With his big body, he possessed all the kindles and humanity a
person can have. He was so a gentleman that he treated his student very kindly
which was very rare among other teachers. He always started telling us stories
before going through the intricacies of the math. He had a great way of
teaching and because of him I became very interested in math. I heard that he
has retired from the teaching profession and now living in his hometown with
his family.

  
The teacher was very kind and helpful to me. He showed a very affectionate
behavior to me. I was kind of amused with his way of teaching and personality.
He has always helped me understanding math if I had confusions and thus an
intimate relationship grew between us. I treated him as a great mentor and he
treated me as an enthusiast student. The teacher was very helpful in every way
possible for the students. The greatest thing he did was the way he taught us.
He often helped the poor students so that they can continue their studies. He
gave us many important lessons and inspired us to spend more time doing math.

  
Thus he was an excellent person and an amazing teacher. For all those reason I
have a very positive image of this teacher and would like to meet him someday.
There is a good possibility that he won’t even remember me and yet meeting him
would be a great experience for me.

place&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an interesting historic place.

**You should say:**

•    What is it  
•    Where it is located  
•    What you can see there now

**and explain why this place is interesting.**

**Model Answer:**  
Machu Picchu in southern Peru is a very interesting historic place and I have
a great interest about his historic place. Though I have not visited this
place in person, but I would definitely love to be there someday. I mostly
learned about this place from one of my friends who visited there and from TV,
internet and newspapers.  
  
Machu Picchu is located in Machupicchu District in southern Peru and it is
historically connected with the 15th-century Inca civilization. It is located
in 2,430 meters or around 7,970 feet area above the sea level. This place lies
on top of a mountain and is a very popular destination for the tourist all
around the world. This place is referred as the "Lost city of the Incas" and
it was named as one of the 7 wonders of the world in 2007. UNESCO nominated it
as a world heritage in the year 1983.  
  
This historic place was built as an estate for the Pachacuti emperor of the
Inca civilization in around 1450, and is considered as the most significant
and familiar icon of the Inca civilization.  
  
A tourist can see the finest work of the Inca civilization there and can learn
many thing about this civilization. Apart from the ruins and cultural icons,
one can enjoy the great beauty surrounding this place. The sunset time is
awesome and eye witnessing the hills is something unforgettable. The Inca
bridge is interesting to hike, and the scattered stones in the place is a
different experience one can get. The Condor, Steps , Falling stairs, Temples,
Sacred Rock, Llamas and other Animals, Inca Trail will all blow your mind and
would remind you that you are visiting one of the 7 wonders of the world.  
  
This is an interesting place due to the vast area and iconic meaning of the
Inca civilization. There are a lot to see, a lot to do and enjoy and being at
one of the 7 wonders of the world is something a visitor will never forget.
This place takes us to the past, in the time when Inca nation were there, and
taught us how advanced they were as they have been able to build such a place
with virtually no technological advancement of modern technology.

**Alternative Answer:**  
An interesting historic place in my country is (...say a name of a historic
place...). It is situated at (...area name...) in (...city/town name ...). In
my opinion this is a very interesting historic place as it is almost two
thousand years’ old and it was discovered in the middle of the last century.
This was the center of the (...say a civilization name...) civilization and
was one of the most prominent cities of our country. More than several hundred
feet had to be dug to discover it.

Now the place has been renovated to reflect the city it once been. There are
more than hundred acres of places in this site and most of them are the
remaining of the lost civilization and city of that time. There are several
old buildings, castles, fortress, monuments, rivers, canons, cryptic houses,
under paths and sculptures are there. A museum was built as recently as 10
years ago for the visitors to learn more about this lost city and people. The
museum is a really good one in terms of its collection and reflection of that
civilization.

To me, this was interesting because of the proof of advancement this
civilization had. I have read a lot about this civilization and cultures of
these people and visiting this place was a really good experience. The museum
was very rich in terms of learning history. The city was more than 2 thousand
years old and yet it has many amazing art works, tools, intricate designs,
buildings with amazing work, finest canon and many more proofs of their
advancement. They had been a flourishing civilization that dominated that part
of the country. The idea of our civilization being found by future generation
was an interesting idea and this historic place just reminded me that. The
museum, the fine airmanship and advancement of that civilization are all
amazing historic proof and interesting to explore.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe the most polite person you know.

**You should say:**

  * Who is this person
  * How you meet him/ her
  * Do you enjoy his/ her company?

**and explain why do you think him/ her to be the most polite person.**

**Model Answer:**  
I have met many persons with very polite behaviors and soft attitude and among
them my neighbor Mr. Arun _(...say a name you like...)_ is the most polite
person I have ever met. Interestingly he is very talented, well-mannered, has
extended experience of travelling and he is a writer. There is a rumor that
after his son died; he started living a discrete and solitary life.  
  
I first met him after he moved to our neighborhood around 5 years back. One
day I went to his home to give some homemade food for a major festival. The
way he greeted me and thanked me was simply amazing. I was around 19-20 years
old but he treated me as if I was a much aged person. I am at least 20 years
junior to him and yet he showed me a respect which is very rare nowadays.  
  
In fact he is well-known in our community as a perfect gentleman and a sober
person. Almost everyone of our locality likes him for his polite manner,
serene life-style and his wit. I often visit his place and discuss on several
issues. He is a great problem solver and has a natural gift on Mathematics. He
often helped me on my studies and we played table tennis, chess and other
indoor games. The most interesting part about him is that he is a brave person
and he often protests the unfair issues of our community. But those are so
natural and his way of presenting those issues are so important and obvious
that people obey him and give great concerns on the issues he raises. Besides,
people respect his judgments and good wills. I like spending time with him and
enjoy his accompany. We all have our own perceptions about polite persons and
in my opinion he is a perfect example how people can be earnest and polite
being very brave, intelligent and righteous.

know-well&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a children's story that you know well.

**You should say:**

  * when you first heard or read it
  * what you particularly liked about it
  * why you think it became popular

**and give a brief of the story.**

**Sample Answer 1:**

The first children’s story I can think of is one that I doubt you will know.
It was one of my absolutely favourite stories when I was little, and I just
assumed everyone else knew it too.  As I’ve got older I’ve never met anyone
else who read it, I feel you have all missed out, maybe by talking about it to
you today you will one day seek it out and read it for yourself.

I’m going to tell you what the story is, when I first read it and why I didn’t
just like it but loved it so much.  As to why it became popular?  Well it is a
mystery to me why it isn’t more widely known, but I can tell you why I think
it is so charming, and I’ll give you a bit of an overview of the story too,
it’s quite simple.  I might tell you that early on actually, as then you will
understand why I liked it so much and why I think it is so appealing.

The story is called ‘The story of Ferdinand’, it’s by someone called Munro
Leaf, and I first came across it as a little paperback with a bright orange
cover. It hasn’t got very many words, but it is illustrated with beautiful
black and white line drawings by someone called Robert Lawson.  I don’t
remember how I came to have the book, it must have been a present from
someone, and I was very little when I first read it.  Maybe around five year’s
old, although I can’t be sure.

The story nearly broke my heart when I was little!  It is the tale of a bull
called Ferdinand that was bred to fight in Spain.  I couldn’t believe that
such a cruel sport existed, and it was terrible to me that this little bull
was to be forced to battle.  The story was how he never liked to fight.  He
was a peaceful bull, who preferred to sit smelling the flowers and keeping out
of trouble.  Whilst his more volatile companions practised butting their heads
together he would find a shady spot to sit and ponder.  One day some important
people came to the field where he was living to choose a ferocious bull to
fight in the bull fights in Madrid.  Ferdinand did not want to be picked, so
he snuck quietly away.  However, disaster!  He sat on a bee, and the bee stung
him.  Ferdinand leapt up in surprise and started to buck and plunge about
because he was in so much pain.  The people think he must be a very rough and
tough bull indeed and take him away to fight… When he gets to the bull ring it
is awful.  The people want to fight and kill him.  I was so upset at what
might happen to poor Ferdinand!  The matadors parade in, they prepare to taunt
and spike him with spears.  Then Ferdinand is brought into the ring.  However,
he refuses to fight, he sits in the middle of the arena and quietly smells the
flowers in the lovely ladies’ hair.  In the story, because he refuses to
fight, they eventually take him home, and he is left to sit happily under his
favourite cork tree smelling flowers for the rest of his life… I have a
horrible feeling that isn’t what would really have happened!

The story is completely charming.  The peaceable bull character that doesn’t
quite fit in with his friends is easy for a child to relate to. The story is
simple to understand.  There is peril (that Ferdinand will be forced to fight
and could be hurt and killed) but fortunately there is a happy ending.  The
illustrations are simple but delightful.  Some of the pictures are quite
comical too, the angry matador cries and stamps his foot because he couldn’t
show off with his cape and sword.  The text is very straightforward too, just
a sentence on each page, with the facing page full of the illustrations.  It
was a book I could read and understand myself from an early age.  I think it’s
a wonderful story – I still get a lump in my throat remembering it now.

I really don’t know how someone found the book for me, and I am at a loss to
explain why it isn’t more widely known.  I’m sure if it had been more
available it would have been (and still be) incredibly popular with younger
readers and their parents.  I still have a copy of the book.  It isn’t my
original one, I lent that to someone and never got it back.  I was
heartbroken.  I feel quite sentimental about the tale and couldn’t bear to be
without it, so I ended up trying to get a new copy.  I found then that it was
long out of print, so I ended up buying a ‘new’ second hand version on amazon
or eBay or something.  It isn’t the same, but I was glad to have a copy back
in my possession.  Look out for it if you can, I wonder if you will like it
too, or whether you have to be six or under to really appreciate it!

**Model Answer 2: **  
In my childhood I have heard lots of fables, stories and true stories which I
still recall. Some of them were so exciting that they thrilled me in my
childhood. One such stories that I still remember is a fable of a king and a
giant ghost.

I heard this story from my grandmother for the first time and it was so
exciting that I requested my grandma over and over again to tell this very
story.  


I liked the excitement and twist of this story. As a kid I was interested to
know about ghost, the kingdom and the kings and this story told the power of a
king, about his kingdom, his queen, a ferocious ghost and the fighting between
the human and ghosts. This was a story taken from the fables written by one of
the famous fable writer in our country almost 200 years ago. Thus people have
read this story ad have told or heard this from others. Over the time this has
become a story that passed from generation to generation. Thus it has become a
widely popular story in our country.



The story starts with a wise king who was a kind and helpful king of the
country. But he had no child who would lead the country after his departure.
Thus the king become unhappy and thus the people of the country became greatly
sad for their future. One dervish was passing the country and he was deeply
touched by the kindness and people’s love for the king while most other kings
in the world were feared by the people. He had some divine power a very great
dervish and he blessed the king to have a child. But there would be test for
the king in a time of his life. The king was blessed by a beautiful and
intelligent baby boy and the people of the kingdom became happy.  


The boy became 7 years old when there was a great fight among the ghosts of
the other world and a large portion of them were cast away from their world.
They choose the world and particularly the kingdom of this kind king to have
their living land. They came and started frightening and harming people of the
kingdom. The king declared an war against those evil spirit and won the fight
with the bravery of the people of the country as well as the soldiers. But to
everyone’ surprise the son of the king was missing and the ghost after their
defeat left a message that they have captured the boy and would give him back
only if the people and the king abandon the kingdom and let them rein there.
That was a very difficult test for the king as well as the people of the
country. The king then vowed to defeat the ghosts without harming the people
of the kingdom. He left the country and the story went on. He had to face lots
of tests and thus he gained powers of e truly divine person. Thus he start his
tour to the place the ghost captured his son. The story has lot more other
interesting parts and twists and finally the kind had been able to rescue his
son after 10 years.  


As a kid, the story was so appealing to me and I enjoyed the story telling
every time I heard it from my grandma.

eat-outside-your-home&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about the food that you like to eat outside your home.

**You should say:**

  *  What is it
  *  Why you like it
  *  How often do you do it

**and explain on what occasions do you eat out.**

**Follow-up questions:**  
\- Why do people go out to restaurants?  
\- What are the benefits of eating out? Why?

**Model Answer: **  
I like to eat the pizza outside the home. Pizza is not made in our house
except very rare occasion once or twice in a year and that's why I have always
eaten it outside my home. Dominous Pizza, Pizza Inn, Helvetia, Tongue &amp;
Tommy, CFC are some of my favourite places where I eat pizza.  
  
I like it because it is tasty and delicious. This food item requires only few
minutes to be served and I can eat it when I am in hurry. Another reason is
the variation this food item has. Several types of pizza can be found and
because of that a pizza lover can taste the different types of pizza and
variation of those pizzas. It is cheaper compared to other dishes I eat
outside. A moderate size pizza can be shared among 3-4 persons. Finally it is
not a very rich food and can be eaten any time of a day.  
  
I usually eat pizza once in a week and the frequency of eating pizza sometimes
depends on the frequency of my meeting my friends in a restaurant who serves
pizza. Eating pizza is not occasion dependent like some other dishes like
Mexican foods, Italian food etc. I mostly eat pizza when I need a quick meal
and when I meet my friends in a restaurant. Since pizza is liked by most of my
friends, when we sit together in a place where pizza is served and we need to
eat something, we mostly order pizza.

is-changing&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Tell me about a part of your city that is changing.

**You should say:**

  * where is it?
  * how is it changing?
  * why is it changing?

**and explain how do you feel about that?**

**Follow-up Questions:**  
\- Are the changes in the cities good or bad?  
\- How do people react to them?  
\- Which facilities should the government make available for people?  
\- How do you and your friends spend time?  
\- What are the differences between the way people were spending time in the
past and now?  
\- Should government consider local people's opinion when deciding on changes
in the city?  
\- Should people know about everything the government is planning?

**Model Answer: **  
I have been living in (..say your city name...) for the last 15 years and know
almost every street of this city. The city I knew the first time I came here
is far more different than the city has evolved now. The north part of the
city has changed more than any part of the city and still changing.  
  
When I first visited this part of the city, it was mostly an open space that
had lots of fields, trees and very minimum number of dwellers. There were
hardly any high rising building and mostly farmers and fishers lived there.
The fields, lakes and people’s way of living used to give an impression which
resembled to the urban area life. But this is no longer applicable for this
part of the city. I went to that part of the city few days back after a long
time and was very surprised to notice the changes which occurred there and
still happening.  
  
The need for industrialization, to accommodate the increasing population and
for the business expansion the part has changed dramatically. The open spaces,
fields, and lakes have reduced significantly and one can notice the
overwhelming number of factories, industries and offices there. This place no
longer gives the urban area impression rather it gives a neo industrial area.
The numbers of roads and cars have increased, the farmers and fishers have
moved to farther north side of the city and 2 new colleges and universities
have been built there.  
  
I feel the necessity of the new industries and offices and their importance
for a country, but the way this part of the city has been transformed is
really shocking. There could have been an alternative place for industries and
the city administrators and authorities could have saved the natural part of
the city. Already the city is over populated and because of that we are facing
lots of problems, the changes of this part of the city has caused to
accommodate more people and has destroyed the natural habitat of wild lives. I
feel sad to notice the changes happening of this part of the city.

the-most&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a situation that angered you the most.

**You should say:**

  * Where and when did it happen?
  * What exactly made you angry?
  * How did you handle this situation?

**and explain what you did then.**

**Model Answer:**  
I do not usually get angry for small reasons and not one of the short-tempered
persons who get angry easily for silly reasons. Yet I got very angry with my
friends and I was so furious that I did not talk to them for some days.

This occurred when I was in 7th semester in my university probably in the year
2010. I had a friend named Rumel who invited me and Stephen to visit his
hometown after the term final. Three of us made our plan final and fixed the
date for our journey. Since we were not in the same university, we stayed at
different paces of the city. 3 days before the scheduled date of our journey I
called both of them from a local phone booth to be confirm if the plan is
still valid or not. They both told me they are looking forward for the visit
and Rumel told me that he has already told his parents and relatives about our
visit.  


I called my home that I will visit my friend’s hometown and that’s why my
visit to them would be a bit delayed. They wished me a safe and pleasant
journey.  I got my bags packed night before our journey and as planned we
would meet at the city station at 9.00 am. We planned to go there by train as
we thought train journey would be more enjoyable than the bus journey.  


In the morning of the due date, I wake up early and checked if I have packed
all the right stuffs or not. Then I picked a taxi and went to the station at
7.30 am. I looked for my friends and found they are yet to come. Rumel was
supposed to buy the train tickets and I could not find any one of them. I
looked for them in every places of the station and to my dismay they were
nowhere to be found. In the mean time I hear that the clock is ticking to
announce that it is 10:00 am and I found 2/3 trains already departed.
Initially I was annoyed and when it was 11.30 am I got seriously frustrated
and angry. I felt like a stupid and all of my angers started to grow up. I was
so angry that I did not call my friends. I sat at the station for another 30
minutes to pacify my anger and then took a taxi to return home.  


They tried to call me to explain the reason they could not show up that
morning and almost after 2 weeks they came to my room and explained that due
to Stephen’s mother’s sudden and unexpected illness, he had to leave for his
hometown that morning. They both thought that the other one has informed me
about the cancellation of our tour. I told them that we are even now and I
have no complaints about what happened that day.

activity&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about your favorite outdoor activity.

**You should say:**

  * What activity is that?
  * Where do you do it?
  * How often do you do it?

**and describe why do you like this activity.**

**Follow-up Questions: **  
-  Why do people prefer outdoor sports?  
-  What were the outdoor activities of the past compared to these of the present?  
-  Why are children less interested in outdoor activities nowadays? 

**Model Answer: **  
My favourite outdoor activity is visiting parks, fields, playgrounds and open
spaces with my close friends. I do it in one of the nearby parks, large play
grounds, botanical gardens, besides a lake or river and in any similar natural
open spaces. Sometimes I invite friends to come to such a place which is
nearby my home or sometimes we do it in the different parts of the city we
live in.  
  
I often take my bicycle and use it as my transportation to reach those places.
I cannot do it daily but I gather with my friends usually once or twice in a
week. We go to the park or near a river, enjoy our time, gossip on different
topics, talk about movies and books, enjoy our friends’ companion and so some
short of physical exercises like walking, swimming, running or cycling.  
  
I really like to spend time with my friends as they are very close to me and
they are very good friends of mine. I like their companionship as we have lots
of common interests. We learn things from each other and value our friendship.
Moreover, we stay inside rooms be it house, university, office or other
places, and this activity lets us spend time close to nature and in healthy
and open environment. The open spaces give fresh air, eradicates our boredom
and fatigue, and it is really refreshing to do some short of outdoor
activities in the evening. For all these reasons, I like this outdoor activity
more than any other outdoor activity I have.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a family celebration that you once attended.

**You should say:**

  * where it took place
  * why it was held
  * how you felt about it

**and explain why it is important to your family.**

**Follow-up Questions:**  
What type of family celebrations are common in your country?  
Why these type of celebrations are important in your country?

**Model Answer: **  
I often visit my hometown where my parents and other family members live
whenever there are occasions or I get holidays. I would like to talk about my
younger sister’s birthday celebration that I attended one year back. It was
strictly a family celebration as no other relatives, neighbours were invited
and only our family members celebrated this occasion.

Before the celebration, my mother and the younger sister asked me if I would
be able to join the party or not. Since it was just the beginning of my
semester, I had been able to manage time to attend the occasion.  


The celebration took place at our house at (…say your hometown name...). This
was a kind of family reunion and the occasion was my younger sister’s 16 the
birthday. I was excited to join the celebration as all of my family members
including the new born of my eldest sister would also be there. It had not
been able to visit my family for few months and that was a perfect opportunity
to meet my family members and spend some enjoyable and quality times with
them.  


I was thinking to buy a digital camera to my younger sister and that was a
perfect occasion to buy her the gift as I had the budget to purchase the
camera. I bought it before I left home and my sister was very excited to have
it as her birthday gift. Celebration occasion like birthday is always
important in our family as it allows us to get together and spend few days
together. As two of my sisters were married and lived in two different cities,
they also attend such occasions and we all enjoy our stay together. From this
perspective this was an important occasion for us.

**Model Answer: **  
Some of the Aesop's Fables are very well-known in our country and many people
tell these stories without even knowing the origin of those stories. Some of
the stories have been little bit modified with the context and people of our
country and some of them remain intact. We have even read some of Aesop’
stories in our text book and almost all of the citizens of our country know
those stories.

One such well-known stories from Aesop is the story of ‘The Hare &amp; the
Tortoise’ that people often tells others as advise and to the child to
entertain and advice them. I heard this story from my grandfather for the
first time an it was almost 20 years ago. Later I read this story in my text
book in my grade 4.

  
That was an interesting story that has a good moral and lesson. The story
telling of my grandfather was amazing and he made this story much more
appealing and as I have read it in my text book, I still remember this story.
The story starts with a hare and a tortoise. The hare often made fun of the
tortoise for being very slow and mocked him all the time. The hare mocked the
tortoise if he ever reaches to any place at all with this unbelievably slow
speed. A competition was arranged they both started their race when all other
animals of the jungle were present to witness this. The hare started run and
soon was out of sight while tortoise stated walking very slowly. After a while
the hare felt it ridiculous to run with a tortoise and decided to take a nap
until the tortoise could be seen nearby. The tortoise meanwhile kept going
with a slow by steady pace and after a while passed the place where the hare
was in deep sleep. The hare slept peacefully and when he woke up, the tortoise
had almost reached the finish line. The hare then ran very swiftly with his
best effort but could not overtake the tortoise in time. Thus the tortoise won
the race with his steadiness and determination even after being slow.

  
The story was a great example of teaching children the importance of
steadiness and determination and thus has become a very popular story in our
country. We often use this story to teach others that do not boast on your
ability, the race is not always to the swift, do not make fun of others even
if you are superior to him, so not underestimate the ability of others, be
persistent on something you do and do not waste time idly when you have a task
to finish. Thus this story has become a popular story that bears many morals
and lessons.

teenager&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a friend you had as a child/ teenager.

**You should say:**

•   When and how you first met this friend.  
•   What you liked to do together  
•   What you had in common.

**and explain why this friendship was important to you.**

**Possible Answer:**  
Whenever I think about my childhood friends, I recall many of them who had
been very close to me. One such friend I would like to talk about is Mark who
was a really good friend. I met Mark when I was 6 or 7 years old. He was the
kid of our neighbour and I met him first day at our garden. I was with my
father in the garden and then suddenly Mark appeared there and asked me if I
live here. This is how we first met and then we spent almost 5-6 years
together until his father was transferred to some other state.  
  
We did lots of things together and at that time we were neighbours, classmates
and good friends. We used to go to school together, played at our home, read
and sometimes went to picnic together. We had many things in common; both of
us like playing video games, reading stories, running in the field, stamp
collecting, watching cartons, animated movies, and many more other activities.
Somehow I felt at that time that we have a similar taste of foods, clothing
and views on different issues. At that moment this friendship was very
important to me. We were like brothers and best friends. We had so many common
interests and we enjoyed playing, studying and doing other stuffs together. He
was the only neighbouring kid who could easily spent time with me with the
consent of my parents. My parents and Marks parents were like family friends
and that's why we got the chance to spent time together.  
  
This friendship is particularly important to me because I have lots of happy
memories related to my childhood and had become an unrepeatable part of it.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a useful website you have visited and liked.

**You should say:**

•    What the website was  
•    How you fund the address of this website  
•    What the website contained

**and explain why it was useful to you.**

**Model Answer: **  
I use internet almost every day and if I make a list of useful websites, the
list would be pretty long. I would like to talk about www.google.com website
that I find very useful for me. Google.com is the most visited website in the
world as well as the best search engine currently. It helps people to search
for any query or search keyword they have. It searches websites, video, news,
image, and information for the search keywords. The results are relevant and
one gets enough information s/he is looking for from this website which mainly
fetches information from all around the internet.  
  
I have first used this website in 2000 when I read an article on a computer
magazine about this search engine website. Nowadays this website has become so
popular that a 5 years kid from any part of the world knows about Google.  
  
This website basically contains a search input box, different searching
options like video search, image search, web search etc. advanced search
options, some copyright and help links and 2 buttons to search. Since this
website brings results from World Wide Web, after we search for something, the
results are shown as well in this website. This has become a very popular
search engine because the result it shows serves the searchers' purpose.  
  
For more than a decade, I have been using this website for searching things I
want. It can find search results virtually for anything someone searches. For
me this website is a great place to find information, references, academic
books, story, news, websites and anything I wanted to know and find. This
website is the gateway to other websites for me.

public-transportation&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a trip that you took by public transportation.

**You should say:**

  *  When and where you went
  *  What kind of transport you used
  *  How was your trip

**and explain why did you choose to use public transport.**

**Follow-up questions:**  
\- Do you think people should use public transportation more often?  
\- What type of public transports is in use in your country?  
\- Do you think government invests enough in public transport?  
\- What do you think your government should do to improve the quality of
public transport in your country?

**Model Answer:**  
Though I have my own car, I often use public transportation. I do so to allow
my other family members to use my car for their own important tasks and
sometimes I use public transportation like bus to go to a long route. Some of
the remote areas are not quite as easy to travel by cars and for those places,
I use a public transportation like rickshaw, taxi or rented motorbike. One
such trip that I remember I took 2 years ago when I visited one of my aunts'
house. My aunt was married to a civil engineer and they had 3 kids. Their
living place was kind of a remote area and took almost 10-12 hours to reach.
It was the mid-autumn when I had the trip and I alone went there. I had to use
3-4 different public transportation to finally reach my aunt's house.  
  
I took a bus and it stopped when we reached near a river after 4-5 hours
journey. I had to use a boat to pass the river and after that I took another
bus and finally an auto rickshaw to reach my aunt’s living place.  
  
The trip was a long one and it was neither a very pleasant journey nor a very
disturbing one as well. Changing the transportation few times, carrying the 2
heavy bags were something that annoyed me. But I enjoyed the natural scenery,
a different routine that the usual busy life, scenic beauty on the both sides
of the road, the beautiful river and the new people and place. I mostly
listened to music from my MP3 player and read a magazine on my journey and I
enjoyed that also.  
  
I took the public transportation mainly for 3 reasons: Firstly, I left it home
so that other family members can use it if needed as I would be away for about
a weak. Secondly, I did not know the exact route to the place I travelled and
that's why it would have been bit uncertain to take my private car to a route
that I have no idea about. Finally, it was a remote area and taking my car
would have caused extra tension like parking it, fueling it and that why I
preferred to take the journey in the public transportation.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a plant, vegetable or a crop that you familiar with.

**You should say:**

  * Where  it grows
  * Why is it important
  * What do you like or dislike about it

** and explain why this is important for your country.**

**Model Answer: **  
Paddy is a common type of crop in our country that I am familiar with. Rice is
the staple food in our country and our food demand is mainly supported by this
crop. Paddy is grown in almost all part of our country. But the north part of
the country is particularly the best place to produce the best quality of
rice. The paddy plant is grown in fertile land where plenty of water supplies
is available. But it can't grow in water.  
  
The people of our country eat rice as our main food and because of this plant
we get our food supply. This is the most important crop in our country and
probably the most important one as well. If we can't grow plenty of paddy
plant we won't have enough rice and as a consequence, we won't have enough
food supply for our people. Every nation has its own main crop and their
economy is much influenced by it and for our country paddy has the similar
influences on our economy.  
I like this paddy plant as it looks beautiful in the green field. The golden
paddy and the green plants look amazing when it dances with the rhythm of the
wind. I also like it because it the main food for us. We are heavily depended
on this plant for our daily foods and economic growth.  
  
The importance of this plant and the crop it gives is really huge. If we did
not have this plant in our country, we would have a real problem fulfilling
our daily food needs. The crops we get from the plant are our main crop and
supply us our daily needs of foods. For all these reasons I like this plant
and the crop it provides.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a book you want to read in future.

**You should say:**

  * What the book is
  * When you plan to read it
  * why you want to read it

**and say if you would like to read other books by the same author or not.**

**Model Answer:**  
The book I want to read in the future is "Fools Die" which was written by the
famous author Mario Puzo. He is a highly acclaimed writer and widely known for
his crime saga Godfather. I have read almost all of the books written by this
talented author except 2-3 including 'Fools Die'. I am yet to read this book
mostly because this book was not available in the market and library.

I have loved and thoroughly enjoyed all the books by this author and he is a
gifted story teller who can easily keep you awake till tale night with his
books.Though I have not read this book 'Fools Die', I am sure that would be
another great book that I would enjoy very much. I read the summary of this
book and that seemed very interesting story indeed. No other writer has been
able to tell stories of Mafia families and crime world like this writer did.
His stories and characters are so profound that some people believe that he
must have some contacts with mafia and some of the stories must be real!

The fiction novel 'Fools Die' was first published in the year 1978 and the
plot encircles the worlds of gambling, film industry and publishing.  


I would definitely read any other books I have not read written by the same
author. Since the writer is not in this world anymore, we won't have any new
book written by him but I would like to read any book I have not read by this
author.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a vehicle that you would like to buy.

**You should say:**

  * What vehicle is that?
  * Why do you like it?
  * Do you intend to buy this vehicle in future?

**and explain for what purposes would you use this vehicle for.**

**Model Answer: **  
I do not own a car and have been planning to purchase a personal car for the
last 1 year. I have planned to purchase a car that would facilities me and my
family members to go to different places as an alternative to the public
transportation.  
  
Currently we use public transportations and because of that we can’t plan our
schedule in a flexible way. We have to heavily depend on the schedules of the
public transportations and that kills lots of time. Waiting in a long cue for
the car is very inconvenient and we often feel the need of a personal car. I
guess owning a personal car would give us lots of flexibilities and we would
be able to go our together more frequently in our free time. We often cancel
attending programs arranged by relatives and friends because of the heavy
traffic jam in the road. A personal car would allow us to avoid the busy roads
and attend more social programs.

I often get late for important meeting and schedules because of my dependency
on the public car. Furthermore, in a personal car I would be able to spend
time the way I like and that would be relaxing while being in a public car is
sometimes very exhausting.  
  
Sometimes the shopping I do becomes cumbersome to carry on in a public
transportation and my car would allow me to easily carry them home. We have
2-3 kids in our home and we feel unsafe to take them with us in public
transportation. A personal car would ensure the safety for the kids as well on
the street.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your favourite place to eat out.

**You should say:**

  * Where it is
  * What kind of food is served
  * What the décor is like

**And say what kind of people you think would enjoy that restaurant, and why.**

**Model Answer: **  
The _(...say a restaurant name...)_ restaurant is my favourite place to eat
out. I often go to this restaurant with my friends and family members both for
the delicious foods they serve and for the quiet and healthy environment they
offer.  
  
This restaurant serves many various types of foods and that's why one can
easily pick the foods s/he likes. The main dishes they serve are Thai, Indian,
Italian, Mexican, Chinese and local dishes. On special occasions like
Christmas and New Year, they serve other special menus as well.  
  
This restaurant is a 4 storied building and has a nice parking underground and
a garden in front of the ground floor. Just after someone enters into the
restaurant, the garden gives him a positive impression and a touch of nature.
The architecture of the building looks good from outside and the interior
decoration of the building are eye-catching also. The light green colour of
the wall, the opulent wooden furniture, the paintings on the wall, and the
nice arrangement of the interior make it a nice looking place.  
  
The restaurant offers a range of dishes and the prices are reasonable. The
middle class, upper class and lower-middle class people can easily afford to
eat here. People who love Indian, Chinese, Tai and Mexican foods and like to
be in a nice place with calm environment should come here and try their foods.
Since the environment is quiet and the interior is well-designed, people from
all ages would enjoy being here. The playground at the ground floor is
specifically build for children's amusement and the kids would also enjoy
being in this restaurant.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something you often do in the evening.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * Why do you do it
  * who you usually do it with

**and say if you enjoy doing it or not.**

**Model Answer:**  
I work in a company where I have to work from 8 to 5 pm. and most of my
evening are spent on my way back to home. Sometimes the traffic is bad and I
have to be on the car in the evening time and after I reach home the night
falls. I used to walk or play in the evening or visit my friends during my
university years but the current works at office and schedule do not permit me
to do any particular activity in the evening. However I have two days off in a
week and those two days are different than the rest of the days and in the
evening I go out walking or running as part of refreshment and exercise.

So walking and running in the evening is the activity I often do and usually I
do it alone. I wear running trousers and sneakers which are comfortable for
running and put on my headphone so that I can enjoy the music while walking.  


I start right from my home and usually to go open places or parks to walk or
run. There is no particular place where I go to but mostly I go to one of the
nearby parks which is surrounded by natural scenes. I found some other people
come to do the exercise and to run in the park. I have two major reasons for
this evening activity: first it is a good exercise and second it is
refreshing. I enjoy this evening walking and running and think it is a good
thing for me.

know&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a street that you know.

**You should say:**

  * Where is it located
  * What buildings are there on the street
  * How often do you go on that street

**and explain why you like to visit this street.**

**Model Answer:**  
I would like to describe a street from my hometown where I spent a lot of time
in my childhood and adolescence time. This street is called grace street
(_...say a name of a street you know about..._) and it is at the back side of
the high school we used to study at.  
  
This is not a very wide street and since it is in the back side, people often
avoid this road and take the main street. There are some 2-3 storied buildings
there and one 7th storied building is situated beside this street. A large
portion of the street-side is occupied by the high school and there is a pond,
2 lamp posts, one post office and 2 small tea stalls are situated beside this
street.  
  
I used to visit this street and spent time with my friends in my teenage time
mostly. Since I now live in a different city I rarely visit this street.
However I go to this street sometime with my friends whenever I visit my
hometown. This is the place where I spend my time with my friends in the
evening when I stay at my hometown. I go to my hometown 3-4 times in a year
and visit this street each time I visit my hometown.  
  
I like this street because I have so many memories related to this street. I
still go there whenever I visit my town. And this very street where I used to
spend some of my golden periods reminds me my old time there. Being there with
my friends sometimes reminds me things I used to do there and how precious the
time was. For these reasons I like this street very much.

affected-your-life&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a conversation that affected your life.

**You should say:**

  * What was it about
  * Who you had this conversation
  * what was the topic of the conversation

**and explain why it had affected your life.**

**Model Answer: **  
The conversation that I had with my principal in my first year of college was
something that I will never forget and this conversation had positively
affected my course of actions later in my life. It was about my involvement in
the college debate team.  
  
I was an active debate team member in my school level and before my board
final exam; I quit the team and was not involved with the debating team any
longer. After getting admitted in the college, I got busy with my study and
other stuffs and did not consider doing the debate anymore. Our college
participated in an inter-college debate competition and started recruiting
members for the two debate team needed. I did not show any interest on that
and after our class teacher heard from my friends that I used to debate, he
asked me to join. But I was determined not to join and very politely told no
to my teacher.  
  
Then one day I was summoned by the principal of our college and I had no clue
why he could possibly call me. I went to meet him in his office room and he
started the conversation then. He told me some of the stories of his life and
experiences and thus the conversation started getting longer. He did not try
to convince me to join the debate team what I initially thought he would do.
Rather we had a conversation on our lives, country, and international issues,
how things have changed, educational and political system of our country etc.
Then just before my departure he asked me to consider joining the debate team
and he gave me some really convincing reasons for that.  
I was impressed with his friendly attitude, the experiences and knowledge he
had and he gave some of the unavoidable reason why I should actively
participate the debate team. After 2-3 days I joined the debate team and I
started feeling better. I had a passion on debating but abandoning it was a
decision I took wrongly. The conversation I had with our principal showed me a
reason to correct this mistake.  
  
This whole conversation and event had a major influence in my life. I had been
an active debater for the next 5 years and somehow my involvement in debating
influenced me to study in History in university level though I was supposed to
do my graduation in Physics. Thus the conversation indirectly and to some
extend directly had a big influence in my life and have affected very
positively in my opinion.

![Describe a visit you have done to a member of your
family](/images/IELTS_cue_card/IELTS_Cue_Card_Sample_164.png)

**Model Answer:**  
I live in a different city other than my hometown where my parents live and
two of my sisters got married and they live in two different places. I often
visit my hometown and few times I visited my sisters' houses as well. I would
like to talk about the visit I had to my eldest sister's house few months
back. It was not a pre-planned visit. I went to my sister's house as soon as I
heard that my little niece got sick and my brother-in-law was out of the
country at that time.  
  
After I heard the news of my niece's sickness, I packed my stuffs and left for
my hometown. There I met my parents and stayed for about 2 hours or so. My
journey to my hometown took around 4 hours. Then I took some home-made foods
and other stuffs for my sister and my niece which my mother game me and then
left for my sister's house. The journey took another 3 hours and I took a
public bus, a taxi and finally a CNG four wheeler.  
  
I had to be there to help my sister and take care of my 8 years old niece who
got ill. No other male family member was present at the house that time and I
was a great help for my sister. As my niece was very sick, my sister needed
someone to mentally support her and help her on some works as well. I called
the doctor, purchased fruits and medicines and took my niece to the diagnostic
center for test and reports as well. For all those reasons I had to go there
and my presence there was utmost important.

you-admire&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a leader or politician who you admire.

**You should say:**

  * Who is s/ he?
  * What is so appealing in him?
  * What type of leader is he/ she

**and explain why do you admire him /her.**

**Model Answer: **  
The leader I really like and admire is (_…say a name of politician or a leader
you know about…_) who had great contributions to make our country a better
place. He was a mainstream politician for a long and was involved in active
politics from his school life. He had great contribution in our freedom fight
as well as in several other activities for the betterment of our nation. He
lived from 1940 till 2000 and his death was a great lose for the nation.

He was an honest and brave politician which has become rare in present days.
He never compromised with the evil power of the politics and foreign powers.
He had risked his life several times and with his bravery he had bought some
advantageous changes in the country. He was an idol for the nations and for
his honesty and bravery he is a well-known figure in the world.

He was an active member of the (_...say a political party name…_) and never
longed for power or fame. He could have easily gain a powerful position in the
country but he had always led a simple and yet exemplary life.

  
I admire him for his unmatched contribution for the country and for the
nation. We need many more leaders like him and I regret the fact that we have
only very few leaders like him in our country. He was an ideal leader who has
put his personal benefits away while he thought for the benefits of the
country and the nation.



**Alternative Answer:**  
As a nation we are proud to have many legendary and visionary leaders who had
shaped our fortune and devoted their lives and time to build the country.
Among those impressive leaders and politicians I would pick (...say a famous
leader's name...) as my most favourite leader whom I really admire and
respect. He is such a popular and beloved leader that I have found that most
of the people like and admire him. He possesses a very high political position
with really immense power and yet he has chosen to lead such an ordinary and
poor life that it is possible only by a dedicated, honest, good hearted and
completely honest leader. While he could have made a great fortune and could
have exercised his power like many other politicians and leaders, he has
chosen the honesty, integrity, responsibility and truth as his virtues.  
  
The most appealing part about him is his honesty and fierceness for the truth
and just. He does not fear any one as long as it is to establish the just and
right. Because of his invaluable contribution and dedication many positive
changes have been made in our country. I, like many others, like him because
of his honesty, truthfulness, and fight for justice, dedication, patriotism,
and benevolent attitude to the poor people. He is a rare politician in this
era of corruption and selfishness. The world needs more leaders like him to
make it a better place.  
  
I am sure with his contribution our nation will progress further. The vision
and leadership quality of this politician would inspire the young party
members to contribute towards the betterment of the nation.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a good news you received through phone.

**You should say:**

  * What was the news
  * What time you heard it
  * Who gave you the news

**and explain how you felt about the news.**

**Model Answer:**  
After I finished my graduation, I applied for 2-3 jobs and faced the
interviews in these companies. One day I got a phone call from one of the
companies from the HR department and the caller confirmed that I was hired for
the job I applied for. This was a very exciting and good news for me as I was
expecting to start a job so eagerly.

I did not know the person who called me at that time but later I found that he
was the head of the human resources department of the company and his name was
Kane. I heard it in (…say a year i.g. 2004…) and it was probably June.



My parents and relatives wanted me to get involved in a job right after my
graduation and I felt the same. Some of my classmates were already doing jobs
and I thought I should start a job as well. After I got the job confirmation
call, I was very excited and happy. The first job confirmation in my opinion
is very significant and exhilarating and I felt no less. I was so happy that I
instantly confirmed that I’d be joining the job from the next week. Then I
shared the news with my parents and sisters and they were very happy as well.

sample%2F937-ielts-cue-card-sample-179-describe-a-film-you-have-never-seen-
but-would-like-to-see&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a film you have never seen but would like to see.

**You should say:**

  * What kind of film it is
  * What it is about
  * Where the story is set

**And explain why you would like to see that film.**

**Model Answer:**  
I have a must-watch list of movies and I would like to watch them all over
time. One such movie that I would like to see is 'Citizen Kane'. This movie
was directed, co-written, produced and starring by Orson Welles who is
considered to be one of the greatest producers of all time. I have heard and
read reviews of this movie and few times asked the CD/ DVD rent shops if they
have this movie or not. Somehow I am yet to enjoy this movie. This is an
American drama film that was released in 1941. This film is particularly
critically acclaimed because of some innovations like cinematography, music
and narrative structure. According to many reliable reviews and lists, it is
considered to be the greatest film ever made in Hollywood.  
  
Though I have not watched, it I have read the story line in rotten tomato and
IMDB. The story examines the life and legacy of Foster Kane. In the story the
wealthy newspaper publisher Kane dies while holding a snow globe and utters
'Rosebud', while living alone in his vast estate. The globe fall down from his
hand and smashes and his dead becomes sensational news around the world. A
newspaper reporter tries to find out about his life and in particular to
reveal the meaning behind his last word 'Rosebud'.  
  
He then starts interviewing Kane's frineds and associates and Kane's story
unfolds in a series of flashbacks. The journalist meets a person who served as
Kane's guardian during his childhood. He then learns about Kane's childhood
and later from Kane's business manager to learn more about him. Flashbacks
reveal that Kane spent his childhood in poverty and then later he inherits a
property that his mother got by chance. At the age of 25 he enters in to the
newspaper business and finally takes control of the newspaper. He finally
entered in the politics and a dispute ruined his political career. Kane spends
his last years in a solitary estate and there was no a relative or wife
around. There he dies and his butler hears Kane says "Rosebud" as his last
word in his life.  
  
After his death, his vast amounts of belongings are classified. During this
time the reporter thinks he is unable to solve the mystery of the 'Rosebud'
and thinks that would remain unsolved forever. He concluded that Kane was the
man who archived everything he wanted and lost them all. May be Rosebud is the
thing he could not get or lost. At the end of the movie the mystery was solved
for the audiences and it reveals that Rosebud was the name of the sled from
Kane's childhood which was actually an illusion to the only time of him life
when he was truly happy. The sled was considered to be a piece of junk and was
burned in a basement by Xanadu's departing staff.  
  
This was a truly amazing film that I thoroughly enjoyed. The plot, the story
line, the acting and production and making of the film was exemplary.

your-friend&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a good quality you admire in your friend.

**You should say:**

  * What the quality is
  * How this is a good quality
  * How do you feel about it

**and explain why you like this quality.**

**Model Answer: **  
There are several qualities which I expect to have in my friends and among
them truthfulness is the quality I admire most. In my opinion the most
important and fundamental quality that makes the bonding among friends
stronger is the truthfulness. If a friend tells me the truth, no matter what I
would stick to his/ her friendship. The trustworthiness can exist only the
truthfulness persists between two friends.  
  
I sometimes evaluate other with the way I judge myself. For instance, I would
tell the truth to my friends and I know this would make them rely on me and
have faith on me in the long run. Similarly I want my friends to tell the
truth always. The lies can never make friendship strong and in fact if a
friend finds that his best friend has lied to him/ her, the friendship would
become shaky.  
  
I strongly feel that friends should first tell the truth and then other
important factors would exist among them. I believe a good friend should never
lie and thus the truthfulness among friends strengthens their trust,
reliability, dependency and belief. For all those reasons I like this quality.

someone&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a letter you wrote to someone.

**You should say:**

  * Who did you write?
  * What did you write?
  * Why did you write?

**and explain why this letter was important to you.**

**Model Answer 1:**  
With the convenient of internet and email facility, we hardly write hand-
written letters but I did not have the internet facility until I become 14
years old. I was admitted in a renowned school when I was a 10 years old and
had to stay at the school boarding during my study there. I was sad to leave
my parents and siblings but had no other choice other than staying at the
boarding as the school did not accept stay-home students. After I left my home
and start my life in the school boarding, I missed my family very much. I
would like to describe a letter that I wrote to my mother while my staying at
the boarding.

I wrote the letter to my mother and I wrote to let her know that I was fine
and not to worry about me. I also wrote how much I was missing them and how
things were going on in my school life. I also asked how my father was doing,
if he had mentioned me, what my brother and sister are doing these days and if
they are missing me. I remember asking a lots of questions in my letter and
told all the positive things about my new life so that my mother does not
worry too much.  


I wrote about my teachers, new class-mates and how welcoming they are. I
mentioned that I like the foods they are serving and I am doing my study
attentively. That was a letter written by a little boy (..mention girl if you
are a girl…) to his (…her..) mother to let her know that he (..she…) was fine
and asked if they were missing him (…her..) or not.

To me this was an important letter as this was the first time I wrote to my
mother. I wrote to let her know that I love them very much and was missing
them. I was bit lonely at that time and the letter was a form of conversation
and to keep in touch with my dearest mother and other family members.

Q. What is the difference between letter and e-mail?

life&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a success in your life.

**You should say:**

  * What was it
  * When did you get this success
  * How to get it

**and describe who with/ what did you do in this success.**

**Model Answer:**  
The way we look at our success and the way people look at it differ. We
sometimes consider our small and personal achievements as great success while
to others; those might not be counted as success at all. Thus we judge
ourselves in a different angel than people do. However some successes are
exemplary and inspiring. The success that I achieved and would like to talk
about is my involvement in a social welfare activity that I greatly feel proud
of.  
  
The local authority of our hometown once planned to build a multi-storied
shopping mall in a public park. Some of us suddenly noticed that they have
started cutting the trees and we later learned that they will build a shopping
mall there. We instantly planned to protest if though we knew that it would be
complicated issues and we have little power against the powerful authority
that have planned to destroy the park and make it a profitable market place.
We were initially 5-6 persons involved in the protest and we let the community
people know about the mischievous plan the authority has taken. Later 20 more
people joined our group. We went to the local authority, journalists; police
station met local politicians and social workers, and presented our view and
abhorrent plan the authority has taken. Because of our protests, the tree
cutting was halted. Later we found that more community people joined us and a
big news has been published in the local newspapers regarding this issue.  
  
The park was the only green place and recreation centre for the local people.
People came there in the morning and evening to walk, run and do other short
of social activities. Children enjoyed playing there and some social programs
held there. A large number of birds stay at the trees of the park and
destroying this park would have been a serious threat to our environment as
there were more than 300 different trees there. It was not easy to fight with
the powerful authority and we had to struggle a lot for more than 6 months. We
finally went to court and got the decree against destroying the park.

This whole event occurred 5 years back when I was a fresh college student. I
still consider my involvement to save the part as a great thing I did and
being able to save the park and nature is a big success in my life.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about an activity you like doing.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * Who you do it with/ How you do it
  * why you enjoy doing it

**and explain why it is a good activity.**

**Model Answer: **  
With the job, study and other responsibilities I have a busy schedule in my
daily life and over the number of activities I had got limited. Yet, I
maintain some of the activities I really enjoy. One such activities is hanging
out with friends during my day offs. We often meet at a place in the evening
and enjoy our time. Sometimes we meet at a public place like park, or field
and sometimes we go to watch the theater.

I mostly do it with my close friends and we have 4-5 such friends who meet
each other on our day-offs. I enjoy spending times with my friends as they are
my long time friends and have good understanding. I enjoy the topic we discuss
or even the chit-chat we have in our conversation. As all of us got busy over
time, we can’t meet very often and our meeting on our day-offs helps us
maintaining our social gathering and friendship. We often plan to go to worth
watching theatrical performance and movies and enjoy our time.

  
This is indeed a good activity, at least to me, as I value their friendship
and enjoy their company. Good friends are like treasures in life as I have
often found their helps in times of distress and need. Thus the activity I
have allows me to spend some quality times, get their updates, discuss on
topics that I learn things from and allow me doing some activities that
otherwise would not have been possible.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about your favourite TV channel.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * How often do you watch it
  * What type of programmes does it broadcast

**and explain why do you like this TV channel.**

**Model Answer:**  
I do not watch TV that much but it is a great electronic media for education
and entertainment. Sometimes I watch TV, mostly in my free time and among the
channels I watch, 'Discovery Channel' is my most favorite. Whenever I held the
TV remote control in my hand, I look for either a news channel or Discovery
channel. This is the channel I watch more often than any other channels. I
watch it for 4-8 hours per week. On my day off, if I am in front of TV, I
watch the great educational and recreational programs that this channel
broadcasts.

It broadcasts mainly documentary programs focusing on popular science,
technology and history. But recently they have started showing some other
types of programs like reality show and pseudo technology and entertainment.
There are some unique programs that they present to their audiences like Myth
Busters, Unsolved History, automobiles, and occupations etc. This channel
started broadcasting from 1985 and has become one the most popular TV channels
in the world because of their emphasizes on high quality programs.



I like this TV channel because of the programs and documentaries they present.
Most of the programs are thoroughly enjoyable and offers lots of information
to the audiences. This is one of the great sources for me to learn history,
technology and other educational knowledge. The picture quality is really nice
and this channel is easily available via the cable service providers. I found
this channel really interesting and I can learn many new things watching it.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about an expensive thing you bought recently.

**You should say:**

  * What was it
  * When did you buy it
  * From where did you buy it

**and say did you have to save money for it.**

**Model Answer:**  
The expensive thing that I recently bought is a Sony Vaio laptop which cost me
around $2000. The Sony laptop I bought is a third generation i7 laptop and it
came with the original Windows 8 operating system. I bought it 3 months ago
from the computer market. This is the largest computer and electronics market
in our city. I bought it from the Sony showroom and they gave me 2 years
warranty on my laptop.

Yes I had to save money to buy it. My previous laptop was getting out-of-dated
and I needed a new laptop with better configuration. I finalized my budget
after comparing the prices and brands 7-8 months ago and I started saving
money from then.

My father has given me the 50% of the price and remaining half came from my
savings. I saved the money from the amount I earn from my part-time job and
some of the amount was saved from the monthly expense amount I get from my
parents. Thus I saved the amount required to purchase the laptop in my bank
account and withdrew the whole amount before I purchased it.

I was so happy to have this new laptop even though it cost me more than I
could afford as a student.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a school which you went to

**You should say:**

  * when you went there
  * how many people studied there
  * how long you spent there

**and explain what you liked and disliked about it.**

**Model Answer:**  
I went to (…say a school name you attended..) school in my childhood and
studied there from (..from class  to class…) my grade 3 to grade 7. I was
around 8 years old when I first went to this school and had been there till I
became 13 years old. This was one of the most popular schools in the city and
I had to be accepted in the admission test before I actually started reading
there.  
  
The school was a 4 stories building and there were approximately 300 students
and 40 teachers in this school. I had been a kid when I studied there and I
have lots of memories related to this school. I liked the way teachers behaved
with us, the very interesting way they taught us, the play-ground and my class
mates. We had a big hall room where we gathered during the tiffin time and
enjoyed gossiping with friends. The large green fields were one of our
favorite places and we often played and ran there. The school provided us
tiffin and snacks which we really liked.  
  
Things I did not like about the school are only few and among them the noise
produced by the nearby road was of the most irritating thing for us. Since the
school was situated near the main road, sound pollution was a dire issue for
us. I hated the fact that the class started from 6:30 am and because of that I
had to wake up very early in the morning. There were 2-3 teachers who had
ferocious characteristics and I abhorred their rude behaviors some times.  
  
I mostly enjoyed the time I spent in the school. I had many good friends and I
liked the environment and teachers o this school.

Q. How are education priorities today different from those in the past?

cook&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a dish you know how to cook.

**You should say:**

  * what ingredients are required to cook it
  * where you learned it from
  * how you cook this dish

**and tell if this is an easy dish to cook or not.**

**Model Answer: **  
I am not a good cook and I know very little about cooking and related stuffs.
Yet, I know how to cook only a few common dishes as I had to cook sometimes
during my university life/ college life. One such dish is the boiled rice and
mutton curry.  
  
To cook this dish we would need the rice, mutton, some spices, onion, vinegar,
mustard, water, oil, salt and some other basic cooking ingredients.  
I probably learned it from my mother's cooking. As I have seen my mother cook
this very dish countless times, the idea and cooking of this dish came to me
from there. When I cooked this dish for the first time, I actually recalled
what my mother did and I followed the memories I had regarding my mother
cooking this dish. So in a sense, I learned it from my mother, though she did
not teach me how to cook this dish directly.  
  
To cook this dish, one need to clean and wash the rice and then boil it in the
water for about 30 minutes. At the end the cook has to check the water level
and if needed s/he would need to drop off the extra water. Thus the boiled
rice item would be prepared. To make it tasty, we sometimes use a very small
portion of ghee/ tasty butter to give it a good scent and a delicious taste.  
  
For the mutton curry part, the cook must wash the mutton first and then keep
it in the water for about 20 minutes. After the mutton is washed neatly, it
would have to put in the amalgam of the 3-4 spices, oil and vinegar. After
that water would be added to this and the cook has to wait for 20-30 minutes
before it would be ready to be served along with the rice.  
  
I would say this is an easy dish to cook. It does not require so many
ingredients or so many complex processes for cooking. This is a tasty dish
that can be prepared easily and the taste would be great if everything goes
alright.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

Q. Who cooks in a family in your country?

Q. Will you cook for your friends when they visit you?

Q. Who cooks in a family in your country?

Q. What do you think of the advantages and disadvantages of fast food?

world-a-better-place&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a job that helps making the world a better place.

**You should say:**

  * what job is it
  * how you learn about it
  * why do you think it helps so much

**and explain why do you think it can make the world a better place.**

**Model Answer:**  
Teaching in different educational institutions is a job that helps making the
world a better place. There are many different jobs that put great
contributions making the world better but on my opinion the contributions
teachers make to educate people is a noble profession and has really great
contribution towards the society and civilization.  
  
I mostly learned from my own experience and thought about the great
contributions the teachers have made and are still making. I learned about
teaching professions in my childhood in a conversation I had with my mother. I
asked many questions to my mother about the jobs teachers do and why do they
do it, and my mother answered those questions. Later on I have read many
articles in newspapers and internet and have learned the great gift the
teachers are giving to our society.  
  
It is an inevitable fact that education is the main power and backbone of a
nation and teachers are the craftsmen to make a nation educated. From our
childhood we start learning from our family and surroundings and later on we
go to different educational institutes to learn and acquire knowledge.
Teachers not only teach us the academic lessons, they also teach us the
importance of educations, they inspire us, they motivate us, they teach us
morality, honestly and many other aspects of life. The things we learn from
our schools and teachers shape us what we become. Without their hard work and
contribution we would have been savage, uneducated and uncivilized.  
  
The teachers are the human engineers who are continuously working on creating
the next leader, scientist, writer, architect, doctor, researcher, pilot,
artist, musician, and composer etc. who would navigate the nation. Without
their unmatched effort and contribution the world would have been a different
place with lot more problems. Possibly no other profession contributes making
the world a better place as much as the teaching profession does.

##  Describe a piece of furniture that you own.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * where you bought it
  * how you use it

** and explain why you like it.**

**Model Answer: **  
I live in an apartment and there are various types of furniture there. Some
are purely utilitarian purposes and some are for beautification reasons only.
To me, my wardrobe is very useful furniture that I would like to talk about.  
  
The wardrobe I have is big and has 5 drawers. As far as I recall, I bought it
3/4 years ago from a large furniture shop at (...say a furniture market
name....). This piece of furniture is a very handy furniture for me. I keep my
dresses organized at the bottom three drawers. The second drawer from the top
is the place where I keep my very personal belongings including my diary and
keys. The top drawers are used for keeping important documents. I keep my
academic documents, money-receipts and warranty papers of different newly
purchased devices in this drawer. All of the drawers are can be locked and
this gives some additional security and privacy.  
  
I consider this piece of furniture very useful for me and that's why I like
it. It is a good looking furniture that matches with the design and colour of
other furniture of the room as well. If I had not own this furniture it would
have been very difficult to keep my clothes arranges, valuable documents
secured. I have placed my CD player at the top of the wardrobe and the CD's
are placed inside a drawer. So you can guess how useful and utilitarian this
furniture for me as I'm not using it only for placing dressed in the drawers.  
From the time I bought it till now, this piece of furniture has been proven to
be a very useful one for me.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Speak about a special toy you had in your childhood.

**You should say:**

  * what it was
  * who gave it to you
  * what it looked like

**and explain why it was a special toy to you.**

**Possible Answer:**  
I remember having many toys in my childhood and in different stages of my
childhood I preferred different toys. But among them the digital art board was
a very special one to me and I played with this special toy for more than 3-4
years as I recall.  
  
This was a gift from my father on occasion of my 5th or 6th birthday. It
looked like a white board which was approximately 14x10 inch in dimension. The
screen was white and there were 5-6 buttons to operate the digital art board.
A digital pen or stylus type pen was attached to it for painting. This stylus
could be placed at the right side of the board. The board was similar to a
middle size notebook and was light weight.  
  
I had a fascination about the toy when I first saw it at a superstore. I asked
the salesman what the price was and how this can be used. He described that I
can draw picture in this board, edit them, save them and reopen the saved
pictures anytime I like. There was a built-in memory and the user can store up
to 10 thousand drawing. The colour and pen tool makes the painting easy. He
also told that there are some premade design and template that would help the
user to draw a picture. He then added, though this would cost a bit high but
it is the digital version of the painting brush, canvas and colours. At that
time I was around 5-6 years old and the toy really mesmerized me. I had a
hidden desire to own it one day. I dreamed to art and save so many arts and
painting and save them for long. Since I had passion on painting, I thought
the toy would be a perfect one for me. I told my father about my fascination
of this toy and few days later he gave this toy as my birthday gift. I was so
happy to have it.  
  
This toy was important to me because I have longed for it and that was a
special gift from my father. I remember playing with it till I was 10-11 years
old and I have painted lots of things on it. As a kid that was a fascinating
and exciting toy for me.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a building or construction that you have seen and impressed you.

**You should say:**

  * where it was
  * what is looks like
  * when you saw it

**and explain why it impressed you.**

**Possible Answer 1:**  
The central Bank building is the one that really impressed me. I was then
almost 17 years old when I first this building and I still remember that I
became amazed watching and wondering about it.  
  
10-15 stories building are quite common in our town but the 75 storied central
bank building is really different. Not only it is higher than most other
buildings but it also possesses a eye-catchy architectural design which is
bound to absorb any one's attention. From far it will only give you the
impression of a futuristic mega structure but if you observe the building from
nearby, you will see the real beauty of it.  
  
It looks like every inch of it has been drawn before building it. This
building is a fine piece of architecture that prominently announces its
presence. When I looked at the top of this building I got the impression that
it is endless and has made its way over the sky. The long round clock in from
of this building, ticks twice to let the city dwellers know its presence.  
  
This central bank building is situated near the National Museum of the city.
From far away it looks like a pathway to sky and from nearby it seems like a
massive yet beautifully designed architectural building.

**Cue Card Answer 2:**  
The Great Wall of China is one of the most interesting buildings and man-made
constructions in history. When I first visited this structure, I was quite
taken aback by the massive length and intricate design of this edifice. I saw
this building several times in TV but viewing it in person was a totally
different experience for me. In my opinion this is the most interesting
buildings/constructions that I have ever seen.  
  
The Great Wall of China is one of the seven wonders of the world and indeed a
magnificent construction that reminds us the history of the past. It is more
than 21 kilometers in size and is a series of fortifications made of brick,
tamped earth, stone, wood, and other materials. Several walls were being built
as early as the 7th century and the majority of the existing wall was
constructed during the Ming Dynasty. Protecting the Chinese states and empires
against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian
Steppe and to watch the enemy movements were the main reason this Great Wall
was constructed. Soldiers used to keep walking on the Great Wall and could
easily warn others about the approaching enemies. This vast wall runs across
the China like a large dragon and stands like the protector of the country.
Soldiers used to walk on this wall and kept eyes on enemy activities and fires
were lit if any suspicious activity was observed to warn other soldiers.  
  
There is a common misconception that this is the only man-made construction
that can be seen from the moon. Though this is an exaggerated statement,
however, it clearly states the shear size of this construction. Thousands of
tourists each year come to visit this wonderful construction and this has
become one of the most significant tourist attractions in China. In a way, the
Great Wall has become a symbol of China's pride and a prominent example of
it's past glory and strength.

alliance had to form among nations.  
  
This is in my opinion is the largest event in human history that shaped the
world. The world today we see could have been different (_politically and
geographically_) if the war would have produced a different result.  
  
No other even in history has affected the world as much as this war did.

you-had-with-someone&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an interesting conversation you had with someone you did not
know.

**You should say:**

  * who the person was
  * where the conversation took place
  * what you talked about

**and explain why you found the conversation interesting.**

**Model Answer:**  
Last year when I was on my way to my hometown in a train, I had an interesting
conversation with an unknown person and the conversation lasted for several
hours. I live in the city and my hometown is about 7-8 hours away from the
place I live. I usually go to my hometown by bus but that time I travelled in
a train. I was in a second class compartment of the train and there were
almost 10 other people travelling in the same compartment. I found a couple
with 2 kids were sitting just opposite side of me next to me was sitting a
person who seemed around 45 years old. I was sitting beside the window and he
asked me to open it. He then thanked me and asked me about myself. The
conversation went on and I learned that he is a senior employee of a large
Government organization. I was bit confused that he was travelling in a second
class compartment at cheap rent.

He started a topic about how the kids and young people from the new generation
have little passion on learning and busy doing unproductive staffs. I started
defensing the young generation and expresses the difference the new generation
has with their ancestors. The conversation started to turn into a debate and
both of us used our logic and reasoning. The conversation was interesting and
I was actively participating on it mostly because he had good and polite way
of conversation. He told his reasoning for this belief but when I showed him
my logic, he did not protest just for the conversation’s sake. Rather he agree
that he learned many new facts about the new generation and their way of
thinking and lifestyles. He also confessed that the generation gap is
unavoidable and the positive changes should be accepted by them. Besides this
main topic some other topic arrived like the political situation of our
country, the educational system currently we have and what should be done to
eliminate many of your major problems.



The conversation lasted for about 4 hours until he left the train at his
station. I usually do not continue longer conversation with strangers and
often find people start talking about silly issues with no moral values. But
the conversation I had with this person in the train was interesting and I
enjoyed it. I felt like there is a big gap between the first generation and
the new generation and both generations do not listen and think deeply about
the other generation and that’s causing a huge gap between them. I enjoyed to
learn many thought of our first generations and was appalled about some of the
misconceptions. I was also relived to learn that they have a positive attitude
towards the changes which are for good reasons. His way of conversation was
also positive and that’s why the overall conversation was enjoyable.



**Alternative Answer: **

While my journey in a train to my hometown, I had a very interesting
conversation with a person named Smith (...say a name...) who was a journalist
of a daily newspaper. I can't recall his last name but he was a man around 35
years and sat next to me in the train.



I usually read books in long journeys or listen to music. That day I was
reading a book by Dan Brown and the person who sat next to me asked about the
book. This is how the conversation started. The conversation was mostly about
writers in general, the political condition in our country, the role of an
ideal leader, journalism, corruptions and the major problems of our country. I
rarely continue longer conversation with strangers but that conversation I had
in the train was pretty different and lasted almost 3-4 hours.



This conversation was interesting mostly because of three reasons: one, the
person I had the conversation with was a smooth talking person with good
knowledge and experience. Secondly, the way the conversation started and
progressed was really interesting. I took my whole effort to debate on issues
that I did not agree and also agreed with the notion that was similar to my
viewpoint. Though this person was around 12 years senior to me, he never took
any advantages of it and even he did not give any hint about it in the issued
I disagreed with him. He treated me as an equally skilled opponent on many
issues and listened to me very attentively. Finally, the place and
circumstances when the conversation took place was really interesting. I must
say, I learned many things from the opinion and experience he shared that day.

##  Describe what you want to do in the future.

**You should say:**

  * what is it
  * when you want to do it
  * how you want to achieve it

**and explain why you want to do it.**

**Model Answer:**  
Everybody has a plan for future. Though future is uncertain and many times
unpredictable, I believe that to some extend our future depends on our actions
on past and present. In the future I want to run a Mega-shopping mall business
where my involvement would not be mandatory to run the daily business and I
would enjoy my time by visiting different places of the world.  
  
After I finished my graduation, I started working for a small company. Now I
am working for a large multinational company I have planned to work till I
become 36 and then I will take early retirement. The money I will inherit and
the amount I am currently saving per month should allow me to start a
business. I have planned to start a big shopping mall. I will have my close
relatives as the employees and authorities of the business and initially I
will work in this shopping mall for 2-3 years to make it run smoothly. When
the business would go on with its own path, I will enjoy my vacation and would
visit different renowned and beautiful cities of the world. I will visit Asia,
Europe, Russia and many more places.  
  
Hopefully I will enjoy the retirement and the trips. Though I am not sure
about the future but I have already planned for it. Because I believe proper
planning and initiation is the half of the total task and fulfilling dream. I
have already taken some steps towards achieving my future plan.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card Questions:

Masters and PhD from a reputed university and then return to my country and

environment&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a problem that affects the environment in the area where you
live.

**You should say:**

  * what the problem is
  * what causes it
  * what people feel about the problem   

**and explain what you think could be done to solve it.**

**Sample Answer:**  
There are so many problem that negatively affects the environment in our area
and among them the highly density of population in my opinion is the most
severe one. While in many countries, less than 100 people live in one square
kilometer, we have got around thousands of people living in one square
kilometer. Because of this high population in a small city, lots of problems
are arising.  
  
The expenditure to support living is quite high compared to the average
earning of the people, a heavy traffic has become a common scenario in the
roads and as a consequence, lots of time is killed every day. The lower
economic people are not getting the proper education and hospital facility,
crime has increase than ever, lots of unplanned and risky constructions have
been established, the environment is getting polluted and seems like no one
cares.  
  
There are many reasons that caused this outburst of this mass population in
our city and among them the most influential reason is the centralization of
industry in this city. Most of the factory, offices and organizations are
located in this city and people from all area of the country are coming here
to find a living. The unemployment in rural area is another reason why people
are trying to stay here. The political reason not to take strict decisions on
making equal opportunity in the country is another reason. The businesses and
job opportunity attracts people to come and live here in this city.  
  
People can feel the heat of this uncontrolled population and the problems are
creating for that but they have little control over it. We all suffer from the
problems and talk about it but I have not seen any big movement to solve this
problem. On the other hand the political leaders who can take initiatives to
lessen the problem are sometimes corrupted to take appropriate and honest
steps.  
  
There are lots of theories to solve this problem and seems like we all know
about it. First of all decentralization should be done and industries and
factories that can be moves to other areas should be moved. Proper education
and job sectors should be ensured so that people can earn their living at
their cities rather than coming here. Local government can be formed to
support and improve each area of the country. Each local government should be
able to invest and decide about the development projects in their area.  
  
People naturally want to live in a better place where they can find the
necessary infrastructure, daily needs and can earn a living. If that can be
ensured throughout the country, this problem can be reduced.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What causes environmental problems?

Q. What should the government do to protect the environment?

Q. What should we do to protect the environment?

Q. What other measures can you think of to protect the environment?

Q. How should we educate children to protect environment?

Q. What’s the difference between the old and the young as regards
environmental protection?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  A famous person you would like to meet.

**You should say:**

  * who is he/ she
  * why do you want to meet him/ her
  * why he is famous

**and explain what would you do if you meet him/ her.**

**Possible Answer:**  
In my list there are so many famous persons whom I dream to meet and spend
some time with. There are several scientists, actors, actress, political
leaders, poets, IT specialists, business founders, sports person, writers and
journalists in this list but Paulo Coelho is the person whom I would like to
meet first.  
  
He is a famous Brazilian lyricist and novelist who has become one of the most
widely read authors in the world. I am a great fan of his writing, enjoyed and
deeply touched by most of his writing and that's why want to meet him in
person to talk about those stories and to know about the person who actually
has got a brilliant way of storytelling.  
  
I read the book 'Alchemist' by him more than once and thoroughly enjoyed it.
It is an inspiring and thought provoking book and the writer has been able to
tell the story in a fascinating way. This book has been translated in 67
different languages and has got numerous positive and critically acclaimed
reviews. I know very little about the man behind this amazing stories and
that's why I want to meet him - to know more about him. I place him in a
highly esteemed position. I have enjoyed his many books including 'The
Alchemist', 'The Valkyries', 'Eleven Minutes', 'The Zahir’ so much that I
wanted to meet the person who wrote those truly amazing stories.  
  
Writers are dream-catchers and possess a magical power of blending the truth
and imagination to create a story. Storytelling and giving them lives is a
very difficult task. Paulo Coelho is a gifted writer who can easily absorb
readers' attention to his powerful stories. His books are real page turner and
would always make the reader to desire to read more. I have been so mesmerized
by his story that I would like to meet the real person who tells us the
stories. I'd like to know his thoughts and opinions on many things and would
like to spend some time with one of my very favorite writers.

**Follow up Questions: **

**1\. How to make a good first impression (informal situation)**

**Sample Answer: **

Today I will talk about how to make a good first impression.   I will talk
about why it is important, and what you can do to help create a good
impression when you meet someone for the first time.

There is a saying ‘you only get one chance to make a first impression’!  This
is true, that is why it is important make a good first impression.  If you
make a bad first impression it can be difficult to change in future.  When you
meet someone for the first time they will form an opinion of you based on how
you look, how you behave and what you say.

Lots of people are nervous when meeting other people for the first time.  If
you remember this it will help you to be more confident.  
Body language is very important.  If you smile, and look friendly, then most
people will smile and be friendly in return.  However, in some countries body
language can be a bit different.  For example, in some cultures you should
look someone directly in the eye to be polite, in other cultures it is rude to
make direct eye contact and could be disrespectful.  Try to notice how the
other person is reacting to you.  For example, if they look uncomfortable
perhaps you are standing too close, or if they look confused, perhaps they do
not understand what you are saying!

If you are meeting someone for the first time in an informal or social
situation, then the most important thing is to smile.  Think about how you
could introduce yourself.  You might say your name and what you do, and then
ask the other person something about themselves.  This can be a great way to
start a conversation, people will appreciate it if you are interested in them
too.

Usually in informal situations people do not shake hands, they may just nod
and say ‘hello’, but if you are not sure what to do, follow the lead of the
other person.  If they offer out a hand then they are expecting you to shake
it.  Sometimes people will move forward to hug you at a party even if you have
not met them before, then it is OK to hug them back!

If you think about when you have met someone new, try to remember what
impression they made on you and why.  If they smiled a lot, were friendly and
enthusiastic you probably liked them straight away.  Try to create that
positive first impression with everyone new that you meet and you will find
you make lots of new friends and widen your network easily!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a book you have recently read.

**You should say:**

  * what the books is
  * who wrote the book
  * what is the story of the book

**and explain if it is a good book or not.**

**Possible Answer:**  
The book that I recently read is 'The Fortunate Pilgrim'. It is a novel by
Mario Puzo which was first published in the year 1965. The writer Mario Puzo
is well-known for his famous mafia book 'The Godfather' and was critically
acclaimed for his book ’The Fortunate Pilgrim". The writer had adopted the
story of this novel based on his mother's immigration struggling for
respectability in the United States. Mario Puzo himself considered this novel
to be his finest though Godfather earned him much more fame and earning.  
  
The novel tells the story of an immigrant family living in New York city. The
mother of the family, Lucia Santa is the protagonist. It is her formidable
will that steers the family members through the Great Depression and early
years of World War ||. The story, places and the characters became so real
that the readers can't stop wondering about them. The writer has been
brilliantly able to tell a known story in a known tone that makes us feel them
in our lives and that's why the characters and stories got the power keep a
reader awaken whole night. Mario Puzo has shown literacy excellence in this
story.  
  
I liked the book very much and finished it within 3 days. I have always been a
great admirer of Puzo's writing and this one was a really different book than
his famous mafia books. This is a book that touches the readers mind. The
story and the story telling ability were so attractive that I had hard time
putting the book down. Whenever I could I read the book and I thoroughly
enjoyed it.

**Model Answer:**  
I was born in a beautiful urban area called (...say the name of the place
where you were born and spent your childhood...) and spent my childhood as
well as adolescence there. This is a small urban area in the north part of the
country. After I finished my college education, I moved to the capital city of
the country for the university education. I am no longer living in my hometown
but I often go there to visit my parents and other family members who still
live there.

The place where I grew up is a beautiful urban area and is really a nice place
to live in. It is situated besides a river and there are lots of open spaces,
corn fields, paddy fields there. The green environment, comfortable weather,
fresh air, scenic beauty and the simple life of people make it an ideal place.
The modern facilities like internet, satellite connection, theatre, library
etc are present there and yet one can stay close to nature there. The area is
pollution free, quiet and has some renowned educational institutes.

In a broader view, this urban area has not changed that much compared to the
time I lived there but of course some changes have occurred over the period.
Many high rising buildings can be seen nowadays including some factories and
industries.  
  
Farming was the main occupation of people which is no longer true and people
now have diverse occupations. The numbers of fields and open spaces have gone
down. People are widely accepting the modern technology and businesses have
expanded. The motorized transportations have replaced the manual ways of
travelling. The lifestyle and fashions among the teenage generation seems very
different than they used to be and educational infrastructure and facility has
improved significantly than the time I had been there.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an old object which your family has kept for a long time.

**You should say:**

  * what the object is
  * where it came from
  * how long it has been in your family

**and explain why your family has kept it.**

**Model Answer:**  
Some of the books which once owned and used by my grandfather are still kept
with care in our house. My grandfather was a doctor and he kept his medical
books and reference books with him. When he died, I was a 5 years old kid and
can hardly remember things about him. But I heard that he was a great person
and a first-class doctor. Everyone in our locality revered him and respected
him very much. After his death, my father took one of his used tables, an arm
chair, and a big portrait of my grand grand-father and some of my
grandfather’s books as the remembrance of his memory. Among those things my
grandfather’s medical books survived and are still reserved in our book-shelf.  
  
These books would be more than 70-80 years old and we have those books in our
shelf for the last 20 years. The caretakers sometimes bring out those books
and clean those and finally put them in the shelf again. These books are
mainly the academic books of my grandfather's medical college and some of the
reference books for his practice as a doctor. I once opened some of the books
when I was a school boy and found almost everything very obscure. Basically
they are medical related terms and that's why seemed jargon to me.  
  
My family has kept these books as the souvenir of my grandfather's memory. My
father was very beloved by my grandfather and I am sure he esteemed my
grandfather very much. These books are the only tangible belongings my father
has which were used by my grandfather and conveys my grandfather's
reminiscences. Though these books do not have their material values but they
are priceless to our family and remind us the precious memory of our
grandfather.

visited-your-home&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an occasion when someone visited your home.

**You should say:**

  * who the person was
  * what the occasion was
  * what you did for the occasion and the visitor

**and explain how you felt about his visit.**

**Model Answer:**  
We often have guests, visitors and relatives in our home and for special
occasions like a birthday party several invited guests come to our home.

One such occasion and special guest I remember came to our home 2-3 years
back. He was a famous writer and came to our home on occasion of my older
sister’s marriage ceremony. He was known to the father of the bridegroom’s
senior brother and a well-known figure in our city. His name is Mr. Jonathon
Durik (…say a name you like…) and when he arrived all of us recognized him.
The marriage ceremony was a big program and almost 200 people attended the
ceremony. We had to prepare for the program for about a week before the due
date. This ceremony was arranged in our own house and we had been tremendously
busy for the occasion. A marriage ceremony is a big arrangement and my parents
were very busy as well as sad that my sister would be leaving our house after
her marriage. This was a big event and there were lots of things to be done. I
had been so busy and had to greet and serve so many guests that I had hard
time concentrating.  


The bridegroom and their relatives arrived and we got even busier. They
introduced the guests to us and one of them was Mr. Durik. I greeted him and
helped him sitting in a comfortable couch. I got busy with other stuffs and
came to the guests time to time to look after if he needed anything. I asked
what type of foods he would prefer to eat and took him to the dinning place. I
had a short conversation with him and I told him that I have read some of his
books and those were good stories. He smiled and asked me if I have enjoyed a
book called ‘Shadows and smiles’. I understood that he was trying to figure
out if I have really read his books or just told so to convince him. I told
him the reasons I liked that book and I found him smiling. In the evening,
just before the time of the guest’s departure I brought a book written by him
and asked if he would be kind enough to give me an autograph. He signed it and
wrote a complementary note on the book.  


My feelings on occasion of my sister’s marriage was a mixture of happiness and
sadness. I was happy that she was getting married as well as sad that she
would not be with us the way she had always been. About the writer’s visit to
our house, I would say that was exciting. Meeting a famous person and having a
conversation with him/ her is always exciting and I felt the same. I wish I
had more times to talk to him as that would have let me talk more on his
writings and books.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a wild animal from your country.

**You should say:**

  *     what the animal is
  *     what it looks like
  *     where it lives

**and explain how you feel about this animal.**

**Model answer:**  
Tiger is a wild animal which is very common in our country. It is the largest
animal of the cat species and grow up quite large. It can grow up to 11 feet
and can weight more than 300 kg. Tigers generally live about 25 years and they
require a large habitat area that supports their prey requirements.  
  
Most of the tigers of the world are found in the widely are across Asia,
Turkey and Russia. The most recognizable feature of a tiger is its dark
vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. They have got
a big head and sharp teeth claws. It is a carnival animal that mostly depends
on the meat of other animals. The largest number of tigers can be found in
India and the total subspecies and the numbers of tigers are decreasing over
time.  Tigers are good swimmers and are often found crossing rivers and lakes
in heavy tides.  
  
Tigers usually hunt alone unlike other animals that prey in group. They first
target their prey and aim at it. When the target is fixed, it attacks with a
sudden ferocity overpowering the prey with the strength and size. Tigers have
great leaping ability and can run very fast.  
  
This formidable large wild animal is getting extinct over time and they have
become numbered in the world. Approximately only 3500 tigers are present in
the world and the number is decreasing. Many tigers are held in the zoo for
public and they usually live on supplied meat.  
  
In my opinion, since human is superior to any other living species, we have a
responsibility to prevent the extinction of the tiger as we are the primary
reason for their extinction. Wild animals are part of the eco-system we live
in an we have a natural responsibility to preserve a balanced eco-system for
our own good.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a plant grown in your country.

**You should say:**

  * what the plant is
  * where it is grown
  * why you like or dislike it

** and explain why it is important to your country.**

**Model Answer: **  
Paddy plant or rice plant is a very common plant which is grown in our
country. The farmers of our country cultivate it and it is grown in most of
the places in our country. If you go to a country-side in paddy season, you
will find this plant is dancing with the wind. This plant grows well in
fertile land and needs a good supply of water and sunlight. Rice is our chip
food and we get rice from this paddy plant.  
  
The paddy plant is a medium side plant which is thin and the leaves and body
of this plant is green. Usually the rice seed is green in early states and
becomes yellow when it is ripen. Our economy heavily depends on our rice
production. Our environment, soil, water and fields are in favor of producing
a large quantity of rice each year.  
  
Since I live in a city now, I don't see these plants here but in my childhood
whenever I went to visit our village, I found this plant in every fields. Mile
after mile farmers have cultivated paddy plants and wish to get good quantity
of rice. These paddy plants are beautiful and create a harmony with the wind
if you hear closely. The dancing of this plant with the wind is something that
would simply create a magical hallucination.  
  
I also like it because this plant provides us rice which is our staple food.
The taste and food value is good and it is our main crop. Every part of this
plant has its usefulness. Our economy has a good dependency on the production
of rice which we get from this plant. In our country this is probably the most
important plant we grow.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe people that you know and believe to be very good parents.

**You should say:**

  * Who are they?
  * How did you meet them?
  * Why do you think they are good parents?

**and explain what it requires to be good parents.**

**Possible Answer:**  
My grandpa and grandma, in my believe, are the best parents I know. Though
they're not with us anymore for the last 3-4 years or so (God rest their souls
in peace), I have known them for almost all of my life. They had 5 sons and
daughters and all of them are good human, established in the society, doing
good for people and are exemplary for others.  
  
My grandfather was a government service holder and grandma was a housewife.
They have cared their children more than their lives. They made sure all of
their children get proper education and lead a healthy life. They taught my
uncles, father and aunts about the humanity and kindness. They always treated
their children as the most important things in their lives. Even when I was
10-11 years old, I found that my father shares many of his personal things
with grandpa like a friend. All of my uncles and aunts treated their parents
with utmost respect and surprisingly they were so frank and close to each
other. Two of my uncles are doctors, 1 uncle is an architect, my father is a
professor and my aunt is a lawyer. They are all doing great in their
professions and for that their parents’ contribution worked as the primary
factor.  
  
To be good parents, father and mother need to primarily focus on their
children's welfare and future. They need to devote themselves and carry out
great responsibilities. They need to sacrifice their own lives and make sure
that the children grow up in a good environment with proper education and
morality.

Different cultures and nations have their own custom, way of living and many
distinctive characteristics. Some of those are common across different
countries and some of those cultures are quite different. Finnish culture is
one such culture that I like very much. Finnish culture is a rich culture that
has a long heritage and has gone different changes over time.  
  
Finland is located in Northern Europe and has more than 6,000,000 populations.
Finnish is their main language and Evangelical Lutheran is the main religion
of Finnish people.  
  
Finnish culture is composed of Finn, Swede, Sami, Roma, Tatar   ethnic group

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Tell about an equipment or tool that you mostly use at home.

**You should say:**

  * what is it
  * how do you use it
  * why it is important to you

**and explain how the equipment works.**

**Possible Answer:**  
There are many tools or equipments in my house and I use them for different
purposes. The tool I would like to talk about today is the vacuum cleaner that
I use to clean the furniture’s, carpet and my house. I clean my house 1-2
times a week and mostly on day offs. Cleaning the whole house and the
furniture is very time consuming and difficult. The vacuum cleaner that I use
makes it easy specially cleaning the dusts on carpet.  
  
The machine or equipment is very handy and I find it important to keep our
house neat &amp; clean. Our house is just beside the main road and that makes
it more prone to dust. Before purchasing the vacuum cleaner, it was very
tiresome and tough to task for us to clean the house. But this has become
easier after I started using this tool.  
  
The vacuum cleaner is electronic equipment that requires the AC current. After
plugging in I turn on the power switch and use the long handle that sucks all
the dust. I place the front of the machine towards the dust and it gulps the
dusts and they are then placed in a dustbin. The vacuum cleaner is an

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an adventurous person who you know.

**You should say:**

  * who the person is
  * how do you know him/ her
  * what s/he does

**and explain what makes him/her an adventurous person.**

**Possible Answer:**  
My younger uncle in my view and experience is the most adventurous person I've
ever seen and met. He is my father's younger brother and is around 35-36 years
old. I know him from my childhood as he is my uncle and visits us often. I
have always known him as a mysterious man who loves adventure and love to
explore new things and places. From my childhood till now I've heard lots of
stories about him and many of them are so exciting and adventurous that they
can be easily converted to stories or movies. I often found my uncle
disappears from home and then nobody knows where he has gone. All of a sudden
he comes back and disappears again. I heard he only lets my grandpa know about
his departure and his next exploration. He does not lead a conventional social
life and still unmarried. He loves to read and visit different places. All the
stories I heard about him from other and some of them from him seem very
interesting and new to me.

Once he disappeared and came back with the story that he has found a place
where ghost can be found. Then again he came back with long bearded and we
learned that he lived in a forest with people for about 2 weeks. He knows a
lot about people and their customs of our country. To me the most adventurous
thing I know he did is the time when he went to Nepal to reach the top of the
Mount Everest. There are so many other stories that I heard about him like
killing a giant snake, swimming in a big river to rescue a victim, Egypt and
many other places. Everything he does is a mystery to me and I have never met
anyone more brave and adventurous than he is.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a teacher who has greatly influenced in your academic life.

**You should say:**

  * who is the teacher
  * what subject s/he taught
  * how s/he taught

**and explain why this teacher has influenced in your academic life.**

**Model Answer:**  
I have met and liked several teachers in different years of my academic life.
Among them Mr. (...say the name of the teacher...). He used to teach us
history in our higher secondary level.  
  
The first attractive quality he had is his well manner and eloquence. He was a
great teacher and we all liked his style of teaching. We were very surprised
to know that he knew a lot about history and when he taught us, he told lots
of relevant stories which made the classes more interesting. He did not
believe in homework so he always gave tasks which we had to finish during our
classes. Because of him, we did well in the board exam in History. Besides his
great way of teaching, he taught us morality, importance of education and how
to value the morality and time.  
  
He influenced us to read books and history books outside our syllabus which
turned out to be very useful later in our lives. He inspired us to read
English newspapers, journals, watch history related channels, technology and
history related magazines. He was talented and very friendly to the students.
He never turned down anyone whenever someone asked for his help and advice. He
had an athletic body and we found him often participate in different outdoor
games. He inspired us to do physical exercises and outdoor games.  
  
In short, he was an exemplary person and an ideal teacher whom most of the
students liked and respected very much. I have been greatly influenced by his
punctuality, honesty, talent and good behavior. I still remember him and the
advices he gave me.

###  Tips for answering the Cue Card Topic:

To answer this cue card take note on the following points:

  * Teacher name
  * What subject did he/ she take
  * In which class/ level s/he taught
  * His / her teaching style
  * Things I learned from him
  * How s/he influenced me to do better in life.
  * What motivation did I get from his teaching/ personality/ advices? 

After you take notes on the above listed points, you would be very easily able
to talk about this Cue Card topic.

**Teacher Name:** Say a name you remember of one of your teachers. Don't spend time on recalling a teacher's name. You can say a fictitious name as well.  

**What subject did he/ she take:** The major in which you graduated should be subject you liked in your academic years and a teacher who has influenced you should also encourage you to do your graduation on this subject as well. But there is good possibility that you liked a teacher who took history class and you later on did your graduation in Math. So in this case mention how the teacher has influenced you to learn more about history and how his/ her advices inspired you to explore the subject. There can be an entirely different situation when the teacher has influenced you on something else than the subject s/he taught. For instance, you might have learned about some moral lessons from your teacher that later changed your course of action. 

**In which class/ level s/he taught:** Usually we get some inspiring teacher in our school level and university level. Mention the exact class he took and how old you were then.  

**His / her teaching style:** Exemplary teachers usually have some unique way of teaching. A good teacher makes the tough subjects interesting. S/he must tell lots of interesting stories and references outside of the academic books and always inspire students morally and academically. Apart from that, the teacher would explain the importance of education, how education can help you explore yourself and the world, how education flourishes the human quality and your responsibilities as a student and human being. Apart from the academic lessons, they talk about lots of interesting topics and issues. They usually make the lesson interesting and have a great ways of delivering the lessons to the students. Finally a good teacher does not pressurize the students to read around the clock and always patiently answer the questions of the students. They invite questions and do a friendly interaction with the students rather than only delivering lessons. 



**Things I learned from him:** A student learns many things from a good teacher. First thing s/he learns is the importance of education and morality in life. S/he learns different information from the subject and outside of academic subjects. He learns the responsibility, essential quality of a good citizen, get inspiration to become a good human being and finally learn the importance of education.  



**How s/he influenced me to do better in life:** Usually a teacher influences a student with his way of teaching, his/ her own personal characters/ morality/ honesty/ bravery, with the advices s/he delivers to the students and the information s/he delivers to the students. A student can be also influenced with the good advises he/she receives from a teacher. 



While answering this cue card emphasize on the teacher’s great teaching style,
motivational speeches, interesting and easy way s/he adopted to explain
intricacies issues, his/her own personality and morality and things you have
learned from him/ her. You should also mention how you have applied the things
you learned from him/ her or how those things have changed your course of
actions in life.



**If you can answer this cue card topic, you should also be able to answer the following cue card topics as well: **

  
**1\. Describe a teacher from your childhood.   
2\. Describe a teacher whom you liked.  
3\. Describe a math teacher.  
4\. Describe a teacher from your university.  
5\. Describe a teacher who gave you good advices.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 198 - An interesting news story that you watched on
TV

sample%2F963-ielts-cue-card-sample-198-an-interesting-news-story-that-you-
watched-on-tv&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  An interesting news story that you watched on TV.

**You should say:**

  * what was the story
  * which channel showed it
  * what was the news story

**and explain why the news story was interesting.**

**Possible Answer:**  
Though I do not watch TV that much now-a-days, but I often watch the news,
documentary and sometimes talk-shows. Many of them are contemporary world
news, some of them are political news and some of them are news stories. One
such interesting news was a story that covered a case file of police who
caught a serial killer. This news story was broadcasted in Fox news and I
watched it about one year ago.  
  
The news channel represented the news like a documentary and used some actors
&amp; actress and they acted to show the real story. The news story was that
the police found some connections among some random murders. They worked hard
and suspected that one single person or a group of 2-3 persons were
responsible for the murders. They worked for several months to find the killer
but each time ended with unsolved mystery. After 5 years the file was reopened
by a special team of police and they started reinvestigating the case. With
their endless efforts, elaborate testing, extensive experiments and strong
determination they finally started finding connections among the murders. They
talked with different people of the places where the murders were committed;
they went through every detail of the previous files and talked elaborately
with the police officers who were engaged in the case first time. With 8
months' efforts they finally caught the murderer who by my surprise was a
housewife of a happy family and the mother of 3 kids. She accepted the fact
that she had committed the crime and that was revenge to the people who abused
her during her career as a rising model of a suburban area.  
  
I watched the whole news story with great interest. The news story by itself
was adventurous and interesting. Moreover, the news channel represented it
like a movie presentation which made it more interesting and watch-worthy.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card Question:

Note that you are asked to talk about a news story not a news you watched on
TV. Do not talk about the news program you usually watch daily on TV that
gives different updates of local and international events or the talk show
that TV channels broadcast. A news story is usually a broad story of public or
historical or national or international interest and is usually lengthier than
a single piece of news.  


A news story can be usually one of the following topics:  


1\. A recent talk of the town topic that gives details of the news or shows
live on TV.

2\. A news coverage on war.

3\. A news made like a documentary and shown to the public.

4\. A news story on a historical or mysterious topic.

5\. A details on a major sporting event.

6\. A news coverage on an advanced technology.

7\. A news coverage on a social or political issue.

8\. A news details on an interesting crime and criminal.  


You can mention about a news story that know about or watched on TV. Say which
TVchannel broadcasted it, when you watched it, how interesting the news story
was, what was the main topic of the news story and give some details on the
program.

  
For the questions **why you enjoyed it/ or why it was interesting**, you can
say that the news topic was interesting, the channel represented the news
story in a very attractive and interesting way, you learned something new from
this program, the program revealed a past mystery/ explained a political/
international crisis and suggested solution, gave facts on a historic event
etc.



**If you can talk about this topic, you would also be able to talk about the following topics: **



**1\. Talk about a TV program you enjoyed. **

**2\. Talk about a documentary you watched on TV. **

**3\. Describe a program you watched on TV. **

**4\. Describe an interesting TV program you have watched. **

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a greeting card you have received that was very special to you..

**You should say:**

  * Who gave it to you
  * On what occasion you got it
  * What was the message

**and explain why was it special.**

**Model Answer: **  
In different occasions like Birthday, Christmas/ Eid Day/ Puja, New Year,
academic success I have got many greeting cards from my friends, relatives and
among them the one I received from my grandpa on my birthday was very special
to me. On my 22nd birthday my grandfather gave a precious gift and a birthday
greeting card that I still have. Sadly my grandpa left the world after few
months of my 22nd birthday and this greeting card is the last memory I have
regarding my grandfather.

MY grandfather wrote a personal message on the greeting card and signed it.
The message read “To my dearest grandson on his happy birthday. Live your full
life with happiness and joy”. He wrote it inside the card and the handwriting
was so excellent and lively that I still can’t believe that he is no longer
with us.

  
This card is a special one to me as it was a precious gift that I got from my
loving grandfather who is no longer with us. Whenever I look at this card and
the message he wrote, I remember him and his happy and content face. This is
why it is still a valuable possession I have.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an historical event that you find interesting.

**You should say:**

  * When it took place
  * What historic connection it has
  * How it impacted the history

**And explain why you find it interesting.**

**Follow-up Questions: **

\- What things do people learn during history lessons?  
\- Do you prefer to read about international or local history?  
\- Why do you think some people find history a boring and difficult subject?

**Sample Answer:**  
Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in 1914, in my opinion,
is a historical event that I find interesting. This single event resulted one
of the most devastating war known as First World War.

This significant historical event took place on 28th June, 1914 when six
assassins shot him and his wife dead on that day and that created a great hit
in the world, especially in Europe.

There was a political objective of this assassination and that was to break
down the Austria- Hungary’s provinces to form a greater Serbia. Because of
this event, the world and political condition in Europe got unrested and thus
the event caused the First World War.

I specifically find this event interesting because of the political
motivation, planning and aftermath this event has. Though this seems like an
ordinary assassination, yet it caused one of the most deadly wars in the world
because of which millions of people died.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a group or a club you joined.

**You should say:**

  *     what the group was
  *     when you joined the group
  *     where the group met

**And explain why you enjoyed being part of the group.**

﻿  
**Sample Answer:**  
Few years ago I joined a group who shares the common interest of reading books
and encouraged us to read books by famous authors. The name of the group was
‘Lets enlighten’ and it was a non-profit organization that had a good
collection of books from around the world and also encouraged us to read and
share our books.  
  
I joined the group when I lived in my hometown and was a student of college. I
was around 16 years old then.  
  
There were more than 100 members of this group and we used to meet at the
group’s library complex. There were several rooms and a large library and we
used to gather there once in a week in the evening.  
  
I enjoyed being a member of  this group because of the opportunity to meet
people who loved to read books and liked to share their experience regarding
different books and authors. Because of my membership I had been able to take
books from their library. I also met lots of people there who later became my
friends. The members used to share their interest on books and recommend many
books worth reading. Sometimes the senior members explained the writing style
of famous writers and the central themes of their books which encouraged me to
read many famous books. I still feel that I was lucky to be a part of this
group.

sample%2F985-ielts-cue-card-sample-214-describe-an-annoying-neighbour-of-your-
community&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an annoying neighbour of your community.

**You should say:**

  * Who is s/he
  * Why s/he is annoying
  * How s/he behaves with others

**And explain what can be done to reduce his/ her annoying behaviour.**

**Model Answer:**  
Mr. / Mrs. (...say a name i.e. David/ Feona/ Kumar/ Maroof...) is a very
annoying neighbour who lives across the street of our house. S/he would be
around 50 years old and has a really irritating personality that bothers us
all.  
  
I have seen him/her living there from my childhood and s/he's still living
there.  
  
S/he is a short tempered person who uses his/her mouth far more than his/her
brain. Sometimes s/he yells aloud and uses very vulgar languages for very
silly reasons. We thought that s/he had some short of mental instability but
that was not correct. Actually his/her attitude and behaviours with others are
so rude that people get confused and surprised. I have never found a person
who can use so mean and vulgar language only kids went on to play near his/her
house. S/he never returns the balls kids throw inside his/her fence
unintentionally. S/he can scream and shout continuously and even with a 5
year's kid. Though s/he complaints always about others, s/he does lots of
stuffs which s/he would not allow others to do. He/she is in my opinion a bad
neighbour who never helps anyone. He watches TV and listens to radio with a
very loud sound at night, screams with his family members, throws water in the
street, does not keep his yard clean, and puts the garbage in unauthorized
places.  
  
I am not sure what would be actually work to pacify him/her but I guess s/he
needs some friends and close family members who would accompany him/her and
politely advises him/her. May be his loneliness and introvert lifestyle are
two reasons for his rude behaviours and that can be done by people whom he
would yield to. I have never seen him/her going out on vacations and I feel
s/he needs to visit different place and change the monotonous life s/he is
living.

sample%2F1074-ielts-cue-card-sample-215-describe-a-law-which-you-
like&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a law which you like.

**You should say:**

  * What the law is
  * Do you follow it
  * How do you feel about this law

**And explain why you like this law.**  
  
**Sample Answer:**  
The law that prevent the child labour is the one I really appreciate and like.
The law regarding the child labour prevents the employers from engaging anyone
below 18 years old to be engaged in any work that possesses threat to the
child.  
  
Though I am not an employer and do not face the situation where I need to
decide whether I should involve a child to such work, I should not say if I
abide by this law or not. Nevertheless, I fully support the law and would
never violate it. If I am even remotely involve in abiding by this law, I
would definitely obey this law.  
  
I feel that this is an important law and everybody should abide by this law.
Children are our next generation and their safety should be our priority. So
we should never engage them in hazardous work and should make sure that they
are getting proper education. Though the government and the parents of those
kids have a responsibility to nurture them and ensure their education,
sometimes it is beyond their control and each of us should make sure that we
are not violating this law.  
  
I like this law because it prevents the greedy employers to engage the
children to hazardous and dangerous works because of low payment. The children
who should be at school and in playground should not get involved in works
that possesses danger to them. Since this law strictly prohibits the citizens
from doing such thing that ruin the children future, I really feel a great
respect to this law.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What international law should be applied all over the world?

Q. Are policemen popular in your country?

Q. Who are more popular, the lawyers or the police?

Q. Why we should follow the rules strictly?

Q. What can be done to motivate people so that they abide by the rules and
law?

received&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an important message you received.

**You should say:**

  * When you received this message
  * Who sent it to you
  * What was the contents of message

**and explain why it was important.**

**Model Answer: **  
With the wide-spread use of the cell phone, pager and internet, the massage we
send and receive has become an important part of our communication and we
often get very important message through those devices. One such important
message that I received from one of my classmates who informed me that our
exam schedule has been revised and I would need to come from my hometown
immediately to attend the exam.

It was probably 2010 when I was a student of my 7th semester and one day we
saw a notice at the university notice board that due to unavoidable reasons
the final exam would be postponed and it would be around 7-8 day that the
university would remain closed. Since this was a long gap, I planned to visit
my hometown and went there next day. I planned to stay there for about 5-6
days and then return to the capital city to attend my exam.



One day I got a message from one of my classmates, his name was David, and the
message told that the university has opened all of a sudden and the exam would
be tomorrow! I was really confused and called him instantly and heard that
this was a decision taken by the university and the university has called
every student regarding this sudden change. He also told me that he tried to
call me several times and my cell phone was turned off!  


Then I realized that they could not reach my phone because of the network
problem and the texting from my classmate actually reached my phone. This was
a very important message that I received since it informed me about a very
important issue related to my exam schedule. If I had not got the message,
there was a good chance that I would have missed the exam and that would have
been a great problem for me.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a game or sport you have participated.

**You should say:**

  * What was it
  * When you participated
  * How many people watched it

**and explain if you enjoyed it or not.**

**Model Answer: **  
I mostly played outdoor games in my childhood and teenage time and later on
after I got admitted in a university, I played mostly indoor games and
computer games. Sometimes I played with my friends outside and those were
mostly friendly game. I would like to describe a cricket match I participated
in my high school level against another school cricket team.

I was then around 15-16 years old and was in my grade 9. I played for my
school cricket team and I participated in some of the games against other
teams. Our cricket team participated in an inter division cricket tournament
and I was one of the team members. We defeated some of the teams and qualified
to play the final match against the Crescent High school team.



On the day I noticed that there were more than 500 people including our
teachers and students of our school were present. The cricket ground was in a
festive mode. Our team won the toss and elected to bat. We did well in our
batting part and totaled 125 in 20 overs. We had many supporters and I played
well.  


After 10 overs of the opponents game play the match became very tight. Both
team had a chance to win and spectators were enjoying this match very much. I
took 3 wickets and fulfilled my overs. In the last over, the other team needed
10 more runs to win and we needed 2 wickets to win the match. To our surprise
the opponent batsman hit a boundary the match was in their favour then. We
gathered together and made some plans. The last 3 balls were very exciting and
the opponent needed to score two in the last ball. With luck and the quality
bowling of your bowler we won the match. We were heavily congratulated and won
several prizes. I thoroughly enjoyed the game and our winning increased this
joy and happiness.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a true story that is very popular with people in your country.

**You should say:**

  * What is this story about
  * Why is it popular
  * When you first heard the story

**and explain how do you feel about this story.**

**Model Answer: **

There are many true stories that people in my country know and talk about
often. One such stories is the success story of Mr. Arther who is a living
legend and is one of the top ten richest businessmen in the country. This
story is about his determination, struggle, fight against adversity and
finally the unmatched success he achieved.  


The story starts with a 15 years old teenager who came to the capital city
virtually with no capital and no one to turn to and started working as a very
ignorable hawker. But the dream he had, the determination he had and the
patience he showed was limitless. He had to face severe adversities and yet he
never lost his faith and determination. With hard work and determination he
continued his journey. He proved the fact that fortunes favoures the brave. He
had never in his early life stopped from fulfilling his dream and continued
his journey. Over time he has been rewarded with some success and he became a
moderate business owner. He did not stop there. He continued to work even
harder and envisioned a better dream. Thus he started piling up the success
and from a moderate businessman he became one of the enviable businessmen in
the country. Now his one of the top ten richest and successful persons in the
country and all his fortunes were hard earned.

This story is a popular story in our country and people often refer to this
story to give example of a successful man who has fought hard to achieve it.
We often mention this story to inspire people and to advise them how to be
determined and hardworking to achieve their dreams.  


I first heard this story in my childhood from one of my school teacher and in
my college level I read an article in a magazine regarding the hard work,
struggle and success Mr. Arther got.  


I think this is a very inspiring story that advices us to have our dreams and
to work hard to achieve those dreams. If your determination and planning is
correct and if you work accordingly to achieve it, no matter how many
obstacles come, you would overcome it and this is the lesson this true story
teaches me.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an important lesson you learned in primary school.

**You should say:**

  * what is it
  * when you learned it
  * how you learned it

**and explain how it became important in your future life.**

**Model Answer: **  
Primary school is our first academic educational place and we star learning
many new things from there. This is the place where the base of a student is
made and that’s why things we learn in our primary school last for a long. One
important lesson that I learned from my primary school is the value of time.
In every stage of our life we have to value the time we have and this lesson
has helped me throughout my life.

I learned it throughout the 4-5 years I studied in the primary school. I was
only 5 years old when I first got admitted in to the primary school and had
been there till I became 10 years old. I have heard it from many teachers of
my primary school. They told lots of stories and gave example from history and
real events about the value of time. From my experiences I have also learned
and understood it.

If fact our lives are nothing but a sum of time. We come here for a predefined
amount of time and we have so many things to accomplish and do to make our
lives meaningful. We have our duties and responsibilities and those duties and
responsibilities changes and expands with time. So being able to do things in
their perfect time is the main mantra of life.



From my experience I have learned that, time is priceless and we can never get
it back once gone. So utilizing it is the most important task in our life.
Everything has its perfect time to be done and no matter what we do and how
much effort we put later on, we can’t changed the actions we take with times.
I have learned that, if I neglect the time and keep undone things that I
should have done, it comes back to us like boomerang. Accomplishing thing in
time and doing them with dedication is the first rule to achieve success.
Whenever I have values time and worked accordingly, I had been able to fulfill
my aim and expectation. When I neglected time and kept things undone, I
regretted it. From those experiences, I have started valuing time and that has
brought me several successes that I desired. I still try to value my times and
thus I can save myself from regretting later.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something special that you saved money to buy.

**You should say:**

  * What was it
  * Why you bought is
  * How long you saved money to buy it

**and explain why it was important to you to buy it.**

**Model Answer: **  
To purchase a digital camera for my younger sister I had to save money for
about 6 months. It was a Canon SLR camera that I knew she had a great desire
to purchase. Since she is still in her college, it was really difficult for
her to buy such a camera.  
  
After I joined in a part time job, I planned to buy it for her. I wanted her
to be happy with the camera and that’s the primary reasons I wanted to
purchase it. I knew she has a talent in photography and that’s why I wanted
her to have a good camera so that she gets inspired. After I went to some
branded camera shops, I found that the camera would cost me a bit more that I
would be able to effort. As I have joined a part time job at that time, it was
not easy for me to instantly purchase the camera for my sister. Then I planned
to save money for few months and then purchase it. I had to save money for 6-7
months and then I had been able to actually buy it.  
  
Giving present or surprise gift to someone we care is more exciting and
blissful than purchasing for ourselves. As her elder brother I wanted to give
her the camera so that she becomes happy. I also wanted her to continue her
hobby of photography which was quite tough without a good quality camera. For
these reasons it was very important for me to purchase her the camera.

event&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe any public event (_e.g. carnival, sports event, religious event,
etc_) which you went to.

**You should say:**

  * What was the event
  * When you attended it
  * Whom you went with

**and describe what you did at the event.**

**Model Answer:**  
2-3 years back I attended a sports event which was open for the public and I
would like to talk about it. It was probably the month of January and I was a
student of the university at that time. I heard that the Argentina Football
team would come to our country and would play a football match against our
football team. I was a fan of this football team _(...mention any other team
name which you like...)_ and wanted to enjoy the football match. This was one
of the most enjoyable football match I have seen live. Though I liked the
Argentine team, I supported our team from the very beginning.

I had to collect the ticket 30 days prior to the game day and on the day I
went to the national stadium with some of my friends. The game started in the
3.30 pm and I noticed there were more than 20 thousand spectators in the
stadium. I attended the game with 4 of my friends plus roommates who were very
close to me. We sat in the front row of the north gallery and we enjoyed the
whole game. We shouted when our team did well, we showed our dismay when they
performed badly. One of our friends took the national flag and he bore it
during the game. We left the stadium in the evening and even though our team
defeated by the powerful Argentine team, we were happy that our team competed
them well.

animal&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an interesting animal.

**You should say:**

  * what is it
  * how you know about this animal
  * where they are found

**and describe what facts about this animal do you find interesting.**

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Model Answer: **  
Elephant is the largest land animal and in my opinion is an interesting
animal. In my childhood I have seen some of the elephant that their owners
brought to show the public and later on I learned about this animal from TV
and internet.

The elephants are found in many countries in Asia and Africa including
Thailand, Some parts of Australia, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. They are
wild animal and are found in forests and hill areas. There are many
interesting facts about this animal and some of them are really unique. First
of all this animal is the largest species alive who live in land area. They
are bigger in size and a baby elephant is usually 3 feet tall and weight
almost 200 pounds or over 90 kg.  The largest elephant on record was more than
13 feet and was more than 10,000 kg which is significantly higher than any
other land living animal.



Secondly, they are very aborigines animal and there are evidences that there
were 6-7 elephant species during the Ice Age in North America and Eurasia. The
wrinkled skins of elephants help them regulate the temperature and humidity.
It helps them retain 5-10 times more water than a smooth skinned animal. This
wrinkled skin also helps them cooling down their body temperature by losing
more heat. Another interesting fact about elephant is that the herd of the
elephants is usually led by a female elephant. Interestingly the tie of the
elephant herd is so strong that they mourn when a member dies.



A matured elephant eats around 170 kg foods and 80 liters of water and this
amount increases in the rainy season when an elephant eats more than 200 kg
foods. Elephants can walk almost noiselessly because of the soft cushions they
have under their foot. Finally elephants are social animals and they live in a
herd. They obey the rules and responsibilities of their society and the mother
elephants teach the baby elephants about the rules and responsibilities much
like the humans do.



###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What kind of animals do people have in their home?

Q. Tell me about an animal you saw which is very rare in your home town.

Q. Why do people have pets in their homes?

Q. Do you think people do not respect animals these days? What about 10 years
ago?

Q. Earlier people used animals for their work. Now, what do people use to do
their work?

Q. Researchers are being conducted on animals, is this a good idea?

Q. So many animals are extinct these days. What do you think about this? Why
it is happening?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a bank you have visited.

**You should say:**

  * When you visited
  * Why you went there
  * What you did there

**And explain your experience of the visit.**

**Model Answer: **  
I have visited several banks for different purposes and for this cue card I
would like to talk about my visit to the City Bank. I visited this bank for
the first time in 2008 when I was a new student of my university. After I
finished my first semester, I had to go to this bank to pay my 2nd semester
fee as this bank was the affiliated bank for our university.

In the early morning I went to the bank and found that some of the students
were already standing in the queue. I asked the helpdesk officer what I should
do to pay my semester fee. He handed over me 2 forms and asked me fill these
forms first and then stay in the line to pay the amount. I filled the forms
and then stood in the line. After 20 minutes or so when I was at the front of
the line, the cashier officer asked me to give the form and then the amount
mentioned on it. He took the forms and counted the money both in hands and
cash machine. He then asked me to sign in a part of the form that I overlooked
and missed. I signed in it and waited for 2 minutes when he gave me a receipt.
I left the line and sat in a sofa for few minutes as I was waiting for one of
y classmates. After he finished paying his fee, we two left the bank.

My overall experience of the bank was very good as the bank had a really
impressive environment, the staffs were cordial and helpful and my objective
to pay the fee was done very quickly.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a thing that has become a fashion or a matter of status nowadays.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * Why people use it
  * Do you have it

**And explain what influences it has on people nowadays.**

**Model Answer:**  
Nowadays mobile phones have become a matter of status and a fashion item that
most of the people in my country use. Besides, this device has a great
importance in the way we communicate with others.  
  
People use it both for the convenience it offers and consider it as a matter
of pride and prestige. With the technological advancement the utility of this
device has expanded. A cell phone is no longer a device to talk to others and
to send-receive SMS, rather it comes with high resolution camera, music and
video playing capability, FM radio, internet modem, Wi-Fi, games, social
networking applications, video calling etc facilities. People have become very
fond of this device and the teenagers consider it as a must have thing.  
  
For official and business communications, cell phones are widely used and it
is replacing the land phones rapidly. Day by day the price of the cell phones,
talk time rates, internet using rates are falling down and as a consequence
people with low economic earnings are also extensively using the cell phones
for their communications.  
  
I stay far away from my hometown where my family members live. To communicate
them I find my cell phone very handy and the lowest expensive among the ways I
have to communicate them. I also use it to contact my friends, classmates and
teachers. Besides, I listen to music and use internet using my cell phone. I
update my blog; maintain social networking via my cell phone. I have become
heavily dependent on the cell phone I own and to some extend it is a fashion
item to me as I could have easily purchase a low-budget phone instead of the
expensive smart phone I have. For my communication, entertainment and
educational reasons I keep it with me almost 24 hours a day and thus this cell
phone has become an influential device that I like to use.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an interesting advertisement you watched on TV.

**You should say:**

  * What was it
  * When you watched it
  * What was it about

**And explain why it was interesting.**

**Model Answer: **  
We watch so many advertisements on TV and some of them we like and feel
interesting. One such interesting advertisement was the ad of Cello Pen. This
was a creative ads and I found it interesting.  I watched this advertisement
few months ago in a TV channel while I was watching a live sports telecasting.
I still remember it because it was bit unique and the way it was presented was
quite good and touchy.

The ad starts with a boy who was in a school and then studied in a college and
finally in a university and in the mean time the ad shows some of the
successes he achieved and was congratulated. Thus he became a successful
journalist and finally won an international prove for his honest and bravery
in his profession. His parents, mentors, teachers, friends and some others
were highlighted at the end of the advertisement and as a flashback the Cello
pen was shown. The ad revealed that the pen has contributed from the beginning
to the end of his success and was never congratulated. Yet this is a silent
partner of the man’s success.  
  
This ad was a commercial ad of a company who manufactures and sells the pen.
Thus the ads revealed how important the pens are in our success and how this
pen helps people to become who they are! I guess this was a creative ad and
was made with care as it has been a good ad to watch.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about an advice you gave someone.

**You should say:**

  * What was it
  * Whom you advised
  * How you did it

**And explain how you felt about it.**

**Sample Answer:**  
In our life we often give advises to others in times when we feel that’s
necessary. This is a basic human nature to give advices and share thoughts
with others. I gave many advises to others, mostly to my friends and
relatives, and one such advise I still remember and feel good about was the
one that I gave to one of my classmates when I was in the college.  
  
I advised him to continue his study no matter what. The friend whom I gave
advice was (…say a name…) and I talked to him for more than 3 hours. He one
day told me that he had been planning to quit the college and get involve in
some kind of job to support his family. That was in my opinion a very wrong
decision as it would ruin every possibility he has in his career and he would
have to work on low level jobs for the rest of his life. I advised him not to
drop out from the college and study hard. I showed him some of the examples
where others are supporting their family even after continuing their study. I
told him that it would be very tough and sometimes you would feel like
abandoning the college but don’t even think of doing it. I also advised him to
manage any part time job in local library or to talk to our teacher about his
condition.  
  
After few days, he told me that he had given some serious thought about it and
won’t quit the college. I felt overwhelmed and happy to hear that. He talked
to our course teachers and one of the teachers arranged him a part time job.
He was happy and he finally finished his graduation from one of the
prestigious universities of our country. Now he is working in a respectable
government office and he is still grateful to me for the advice I gave him. I
felt very well when I found him continuing his study and in fact he was a
bright student. I still feel very glad to be able to give him an advice that
proved to be very helpful for him.

presenter&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a TV or radio presenter.

**You should say:**

  * Who is s/he
  * What program s/he presents
  * How he presents the program

**And explain why you like / dislike him/ her.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Radio programs use the presenter more frequently than TV programs in our
country and one such radio presenter whom I like very much is (…say a name…).
S/he presents the weather updates in every 2 hours in the ABC radio. We, as
listener of the radio programs, know very little personal information of the
radio presenters and the person I am talking about would be around 25 years
old and is a full time radio presenter. S/he is currently presenting the
weather updates, which is a program called ‘Weather Today’ and I find his
presenting the program very informative and interesting.  
  
Since s/he presents the weather updates, s/he mostly depends on the weather
reports provided to him/her and sometimes s/he makes his/her own thought and
some humors in the presentation.  
  
S/he has an attractive and clear vocal and that’s make the information easily
listenable. He has a different style of presenting the weather related data
and mainly because of that the ‘Weather today’ program has gained its
popularity. S/he describes the overall weather condition based on different
location of the country and then gives some tips to the listeners.  
  
I find his/ her weather report interesting and informative that’s why I like
this radio reporter very much. Sometimes I tune in to the ABC Radio channel to
learn the updates of the weather and s/he is the one to present that.

**Follow-up Questions: **  
-   What are the advantages and disadvantages of being a good presenter?  
\- What are the necessary qualities of a good presenter?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about something that you purchased and had not used much.

**You should say:**

  * what it was
  * where you bought it
  * why you bought it

**and explain why you didn’t use it that much.**

**Model Answer:**  
I love the technological devices and gadgets and sometimes purchase them from
the attraction rather than the need. One such device I bought that I have
rarely used was the Sony gaming console. I purchased it in 2011 with a good
amount of money but have not played games in it more than 10 times!

I bought it from a big Sony showroom from a nearby market. The time I bought
it, I had the passion of purchasing it and I did not thought about the amount
it would cost and how many times I would actually use it. It was like
fulfilling a wish rather than purchasing a utilitarian device for daily use.  


When I bought it, I was fascinated to buy it. In fact I had a long desire to
buy it and after I bought it, I got busy with my study and the new job. I
noticed that over time my fascinated about playing games in gaming devices and
in computer has decreased. Moreover, my job, my university and my other
interests require the majority time and hence I got very little time for
playing the game. With time this device has become a backdated gaming console
and I have lost interest in it. And because of that I did not use it that
much.

received&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an important email you have received.

**You should say:**

  * Who sent it to you.
  * When you got it.
  * What was it about

**And explain why this email was important to you.**

**Model Answer: **  
I have received many important emails and among them I would like to talk
about the email that I got from the HR of a Telecom company that confirmed my
part time job there. When I was a student of 6th semester of the university, I
needed to manage a part-time job. I applied for several jobs but my dream job
was to work as a consultant for a major telecom company of my country. It was
not easy to get the job as so many candidates apply for the job and the
company prefers the full-time employees than the pat-time employees.  
  
One day I got an email from Mr. Atherton (...say a name common in your
country...) and I found that it was from the telecom company where I was
interviewed. It was early November, 2001 and that time I was around 22 years
old. I opened the email went to the details of the email very quickly. My
heart was pounding and I felt really good when I found that the email confirms
my appointment as a part-time employee for this company. I re-read the email
and took a print out as well. The email was sent to me by the Head of the
Human Resource department of the company.  
  
It was a very important email for me as I was desperately expecting to work
for this company and the email confirmed my joining there. Secondly, this was
the first job confirmation of my life and I needed this job at that time. So
this was very exciting news for me and that's why this was a very important
email for me.  


###  Tips for answering this Cue Card Question:

For this cue card you can talk about one of the following emails or the one of
your own:  
  
1.    Email from a company about your job confirmation.  
2.    Email from a university about the confirmation of your acceptance there.  
3.    Email from a friend from a foreign country.

7.    Email from a dear friend.  
8.    Emil from the Embassy that confirms your Visa to a foreign country.  
9.    Email from a family member that confirms the good news you were looking
for a long.

  
  
For the first question say the name of the sender name if it came from someone
known. If it was from a university or a company, say that it was from the
admission, information department and the name of the sender was ….. and it
was from the … department. Mention that you have never personally met this
person but it was probably someone from the university/ office/ embassy
authorized to send yu the email.  
  
For the next question you can say the exact date ( month and year would be
okay) when the email came to your email address and then the time when you
actually read it.  
  
The third question asks you to talk about the reason you got this email. This
is the most important part and here you have to be very convincing about your
description of the topic and reason of the email. Give some  background
details that relates to the email and that would clearly describe the reason
you got this email to the examiner.  
  
For the question, why this was important, you can mention some of the
following reasons. Note that the following points give only the idea that you
are required to elaborate:  
  
1.    This was a long expected email that you were eagerly waiting for.

when-you-were-a-child&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an adventurous thing you did when you were a child.

**You should say:**

  * What you did
  * Why you did it
  * How people reacted about it

**And explain how you feel about it now.**

**Sample Answer:**  
I had a very amazing and magical childhood and I spent most of my childhood in
my hometown which was a beautiful place and offered lots of adventures and
pleasures to me. There are many adventurous things I can remember from my
childhood and among them I would like to talk about my first attempt to climb
a big tree to find the next of a bird.  
  
I was around 7 years old at that time and with two-three other kids one day we
went to play near a big garden where we often used to go. Suddenly I notice
that one two birds were chattering at the top of a tree and we assumed that
the bird nest must have some eggs. We got curious about the bird’s egg and I
decided to climb the tree ad reach the top to see it myself. The tree was
really big and it was dangerous for me to climb it. I was so excited and
mesmerized that I forgot the danger and started climbing the tree. I was not a
good climber but I that did not restrained me from fulfilling what I targeted.
After much effort, I could have been able to climb at the top of the tree and
then I found that the harder part is still to do. The nest was at the edge of
a very thin branch of the tree and I won’t be able to reach there to see the
bird’s eggs. Then I started approaching there very slowly and found that my
fellow playmates were already worried about it. I forgot everything of the
ground and found the idea of reaching near the nest is the only motto I have
to fulfil. After I managed to reach near the nest, I found four-five very
beautiful small birds that had red lips and were playing with the mother
birds. The mother bird started getting worried of my presence and then I
decided not to interrupt them. The mother bird somehow reminded me my mother
and I started climbing down.  
  
That was a very adventurous event for me in my childhood and I did it out of
inquisitiveness that a child usually feels for new thins. I felt great
attraction to find out what there might be and that’s why I did it.  
  
Luckily, grown up people were not there and after few months when I told my
mother about what I did that day, she became very anxious and rebuked me for
that. She told me never to do anything like this ever again.  
  
Whenever I think about that particular even of my childhood, I feel a great
joy. It reminds me the greener and fairylike childhood I had. I remember this
event with great joy and ecstasy.

reading&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a book you are reading.

**You should say:**

  *  what the book is about
  *  when you read it
  *  how long you read it for

**and explain what you like about the book.**

**Sample Answer:**  
I have started reading the book ‘Sense and Sensibility’ by Jane Austen 2-3
weeks ago and got so busy with other stuffs that I am yet to finish it.

This book was written by a very famous writer named Jane Austen and it was
about the love and life of two sisters. This novel is best known as a work of
romantic fiction of comedy and manners. I usually read books on my day-off and
at night after I return from my work.

I have been reading it for more than 2-3 weeks and have finished more than
half of the book. Since I got busy with my work and exam, I had not been able
to finish it yet. I usually read about one hours at night and sometimes more
than an hour if I have days off next day.

The writing and narration of Jane Austen is incomparable. She is one of the
most revered women writers who had a great charisma to depict the society,
people and culture of the old England. This book represents such characters
and I like the way the story was told. It vividly represents the good and bad
manners and characteristics we have and then shows a perfect balance of those
characteristics and morality. I am in fact enjoying reading the book as I have
enjoyed other novels by this famous writer.

##  Talk about something that makes you excited.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * How you feel excited about it
  * How often you do it

**and explain why this makes you excited.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Playing computer games, especially strategy games makes me excited. This might
sound bit odd but I often find a great deal of excitement playing computer
games with my friends over the computer network. I do not play computer games
that much nowadays. But in my college and university level I often played
computer games with my friends after the semester end. This was a great
excitement for me and still it is exciting to me. I usually play computer
games once in a month when my and my friends' schedule matches.  
  
Playing strategy games is exciting by it’s the activities it involves and by
the completion a gamer has to face. The gamer is the ultimate controller of
the gaming characters and fighting, bloodsheds, cultivation, collecting
resources in a virtual world gives me a feeling like controlling and leading a
whole nation. Since we play in a network, there is a great competition among
the friends to build an empire and then to fight hard to survive. By its very
norm, nature the computer games, especially strategy games are exciting.

  *     What kind of books you like
  *     What these book are about
  *     What effect have books brought on you

**and explain why you like these kind of book most.**  
  
**Sample Answer:**  
The history books that express the past world in front of us are kinds of
books I really like. I have not read a great number of history books but I
enjoyed all of the History books that I have read so far.  
  
The history books are fact based books that describes the events, history and
significant characters from the past of human timeline. This can be simply a
book that depicts the earlier civilization of the world, can give details of
the life a legendary characters like Alexander or can simply explains the
reasons for a great catastrophic event like war in the past. Those events and
characters come from our past history and are of great importance. Somewhere I
heard that to build a good future, someone needs to learn the past. I totally
agree with this statement as we have plenty of opportunity to learn from the
past history of the world, our civilizations and ancestors.  
  
The History books that I read had helped me understanding a distant past and
people of that time. History books always plat an important role to educate
the people about the past and I greatly enjoyed reading about our history, how
world was in the past, how different events of history had shaped the world
and its geographical and political conditions. A simple event in the past had
a great influence in the future and those history books are the evident of the
past world that we have never seen.  
  
I like those kinds of books mostly because of the enthrallment I feel while
learning about the history. I purely enjoy learning about our world and
significant events of the world. Those books are great source of knowledge as
well.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a holiday or vacation you spent in a group of other people.

**You should say:**

  * When you had it
  * Where you went
  * What you did

**and explain how you felt about having the vacation with those people.**

**Sample Answer 1: **  
Today I am going to tell you about a holiday I spent in a group of other
people.  I will tell you when I had it, where I went, some of what I did and
how I felt about having a holiday with other people.

When I knew I was coming to Vietnam, I was a little nervous.  I knew the
country would be very different to the UK, so I thought before I started work
at the University, it would help me to settle in more easily if I took a
holiday in Vietnam first.  So, a few weeks ago, I booked a ten day tour with a
company that would start in Hanoi and finish in Ho Chi Minh City.

There were 16 people on the trip including me, and there was a Vietnamese tour
guide as well.  I was the only British person in the group.  The others were
from Australia; America; Canada; Switzerland and Greece!  The tour was really
good, but very fast!  We often spent only one or two nights in each place. I
was very lucky, because we saw many beautiful places and did many interesting
things.  We spent time in Hanoi, Hue, Hoi An on the way to Ho Chi Minh City.

We did many activities together on the tour.  As well as laughing, eating and
exploring together, we took trips on bicycles and on the back of motor bikes.
We visited beautiful pagodas and we even went on a boat trip overnight to
Halong Bay.

I felt very lucky to go on this trip.  It was the best holiday ever!  The
people I met were all really friendly and happy.  None of us had visited
Vietnam before, so we all enjoyed discovering this beautiful and interesting
country for the first time together.  I was really sad when I had to say
goodbye to my new friends and traveling companions.  I think it is sometimes
more fun to share new adventures with other people.  I hope you will all have
a chance to travel and explore new places in the future!

**Sample Answer 2: **  
There are several holidays and vacations that I spent with a group of people
and some of them were very interesting. One such vacation was my tour to a
historic place where I was amid of a group of people whom I hardly knew.  
  
I had this vacation in my college when I went to visit the _(…say a historic
place name…)_ with a tourist’s group. Most of them were foreigners and I had
only two of my friends whom I knew very well. I was around 18 years old at
that time and the journey took almost 4 hours. We stayed with this group of
different people for almost whole day and that gave us an exciting experience.  
  
I took the bus where the other people of the tour were and I met many new
people, some of them were from other parts of my country and some of them were
from different countries. We had lunch together; we talked and shared our
stories and enjoyed our tour in this historic place.  
  
I specially remember 3-4 tourists and a writer from foreign countries who came
to visit the historical places in our country. The tour guide explained us the
historical facts of the place and we learned many things from that tour. In
the evening we played football in the nearby field and then swam in the river.
This was a very special vacation and tour for me as it refreshed me a lot and
gave me the opportunity to learn new things about the historic place as well
as the new people.

-special-occasion&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a meal you usually eat on a special occasion.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * When and where you usually eat it
  * How it is prepared

**and explain why this food is important for the occassion.**

**Sample Answer:**  
On different occasions we eat different special meals and some of the items
are very common in special occasions. One such meal that we often eat in
special occasion is the Pilaf (also known as pulao, pilav and polaao in some
countries), salad and mutton.  
  
We eat this special meal usually at our major festivals like New Year, wedding
and different social party. This is a special meal people usually prepare for
the special occasions and this is widely liked in our country.  
  
The meal is usually served either at lunch or at dinner. People do not have it
in the morning as this is a kind of rich food. A special type of rice is used
to prepare the pilaf and depending on the local cuisine and custom, fish,
vegetables and dried fruits are also added to the rice. The salad is prepared
with various kinds of vegetables and fruits and sometimes onions, and special
edible oils are added sometimes.  
  
The important on a meal for an occasion mostly depends on the custom and
preferences of the people of a geographical region. For a long time it is a
tradition in our country to cook and serve this special meal on special
occasions. Another reason why people prefer to eat this meal in special
occasion is that it is very much delicious and the ingredients required
preparing for this menu is available in our country.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an important decision that you might have to make in the future.

**You should say:**

  * what the decision will be about
  * how you will make your decision
  * what the results of the decision are likely to be

**and explain why it is will be an important decision.**

**Sample Answer:**  
The important decision that I might need to decide at some point of my life is
whether I would return to my village after my retirement or would stay in a
metropolitan city. This is about how I would spend my retirement and where
that it would be.  
  
This would be a really a tough decision to take as it not only involves my
decision and the demand of the time, but it also involves my family members
and their preferences as well. I would wait until I get to the point when I
have to decide and in the meantime other course of actions might determine my
decision.  
  
Most possibly I would decide to spend my elder age at my village where I was
born and where I spent my childhood. This would be in my opinion a very big
decision for me as it would determine what I will be doing and how I will be
leading my life at that time. This is something that would either make me
happy or leave me with a feeling that I should have decided the other path.
This is why this is a really important decision that I will have to make.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a musical instrument you would like to be able to play.

**You should say:**

  * What the instrument looks like
  * What it sounds like
  * What kinds of people it is popular with

**And explain why you want to be able to play it.**

**Model answer:**  
I would like to learn to play the violin if the time and opportunity allow me
to do so. In my childhood my mother once bought me a violin and I really liked
this playing instrument and spent a lot of time with it. This was a simple toy
that produced some demo sounds and I liked the idea of producing music with a
toy. With time I got interested in other things and never had the chance or
enthusiasm to learn to play violin.  
  
But nowadays I find this musical instrument very interesting and striking. I
would love to learn how to play this musical instrument. Violin is also knows
as fiddle in some part of the world and this is a string musical instrument.
This instrument looks like a guitar except that the use of the bow to produce
the music.

The music yield from this instrument is very charming and produces a very
soothing sound. This instrument can produce different sounds of various scales
depending on how it is tuned and played. Usually Guitar is more popular among
young people in my country and the violins are played by professional
musicians. Few people can actually play this instrument as I have experience
and some classical and contemporary music show use this instrument while
performing their music and songs.

I have a fascination about this device from my childhood and I like the sound
of this instrument. If I get time to learn any musical instrument, violin
would be my first preference.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your favourite way to communicate someone.

**You should say:**

  * What it is
  * How you use it to communicate others
  * How long you own it

**and explain why you prefer to use this way to communicate others.**

**Sample Answer: **  
We usually communicate others in several ways and these communication ways
differ based on the person we are communicating and our convenience of
communication devices. For instance, we usually communicate via email with our
clients and co-workers while we prefer using phone to communicate our friends.  
  
My favourite way of communication is phone. This is mostly because, it is
cheaper, easy to use, easily accessible almost all of the time and the
communication over phone is effective.  
  
I have a personal mobile phone and when someone calls me, I can see the
information of the caller and receive the phone using the touch or tap in a
button. After the conversation is done, I just need to put the phone in the
pocket. This is as simple as that. Whenever I want to call someone, I just
need to dial his/ her number and after s/he receives the call, the connection
is on. Besides the calling, someone can easily send and receive texts on the
phones which also serve a good way of communicating others.  
I own a cell phone for more than 10 years and I find it very convenient for
communication on personal and official matters.  
  
There are many reasons I prefer this way communication. First of all, it is
easy to carry and we can take it wherever we go. The calling rates are very
cheap nowadays and we can refill the credit of our cell phones very easily.
Calling locally and internationally both are supported and hence I prefer to
have it as my primary way of communication. Phones reaches the recipient
instantly unlike mail and email and this is why this is a very efficient way
of communication when we need to reach someone urgently.

remember&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a photograph that you remember.

**You should say:**

  *   when it was taken
  *   who took it
  *   what is in the photograph

**and explain why you remember this photograph.**

**Sample Answer 1:**  
I want to talk to you about a favourite photograph of mine.  I’ll explain when
and where it was taken and why it is important and memorable to me.

The photograph is quite old now.  I took it myself using what would now be
thought of as an old-fashioned camera with traditional film.  I can’t remember
exactly what year it was, but it was probably around 2005.  The photograph is
of my uncle and aunt with their daughter, my niece.  My uncle was born in the
UK, but ended up working in America, eventually taking American citizenship.
I didn’t get to see him very often.  Unfortunately, just before this photo was
taken my uncle found out he was very ill, so I travelled out to America to
visit him and his family, knowing that I might not get the chance to see him
again.

Because it was my first time in America, they took me out and about to see the
sights.  The photograph was taken on a day we went to New York.  It was
pouring with rain, and really blustery.  In the picture my uncle and aunt are
both holding black umbrellas, and the one my uncle is hanging onto has turned
inside out in the wind.  My niece, who was probably in her late teens then, is
standing between them, and they are all laughing because the torrential rain
had thoroughly drenched everyone.  In the background is a yellow cab, and the
streets are awash with water.  It ought to have been a miserable day, but we
had to see the funny side because the atrocious weather was so extreme, and it
was madness for us to pick such a day to go exploring in the city!

I really like the photo because in it everyone looks happy, and relaxed.
Although the photo was a bit posed – they knew I was photographing them, the
weather was so appalling it has a spontaneous feel to it, my relatives were
reacting to the rain rather than to me the photographer.  It was also
incredibly lucky that the photo came out so well.  In the days before digital
cameras you would just take one snapshot of an occasion and hope for the best.
This is a brilliant photo, it’s flattering of everyone, and captures each
individual animated and amused by the elements.

I have very few photos of my uncle, but I keep this one of him with his family
on display in my flat.  It reminds me of a really happy time, and is how I
want to remember him too.  Looking at the photo makes me smile rather than
feel sad – he looks so joyful with his family - and what better way to
celebrate someone’s life than to remember them with affection, laughter and
celebration long after they have gone?   This photograph is special, as it
enables me to do that every day!

[ Written by - **Lucy Marris** |  Careers Adviser (UK), TEFL teacher (Vietnam)
]

**Sample Answer 2:**  
With the arrival of modern digital cameras and smart phones, photograph taking
and preserving has become very easier and people take more photos nowadays
than they did 10 years back. In our home we have many photo albums which are
full of different photos of our family members including me. Among all the
photographs, my favourite photograph is the one that depicts my father in his
early childhood. This photograph was taken at least 60 years ago when my
father was around 5-6 years old.  
  
As I heard from my grandmother, this picture was taken by a professional
photographer from a distant town on occasion of my father’s birthday. In the
photograph my father was wearing a shirt, a short pant and a pair of shoes. He
was sitting in a chair and the background was the garden where the picture was
taken. This is a back-and-white photograph and two years back the photo was
retouched by a professional photo editor.  
  
This is a very important photograph to me as it depicts a time and moment that
I would have never knew else how. This is the only photograph of my father
from his childhood and it gives me idea how he was at that moment. I revere
this photograph and somehow it reminds me the similarities that I have with my
father.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a hobby one of your friends has.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * Who has it
  * What s/he does for it

**and explain why this is a good or bad hobby.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Many of my friends have hobbies that they particularly enjoy and some of those
hobbies are very common while some of them are very interesting. One of my
friends, whose name is (...say a name...), collects autographs of famous
people and this is in my opinion is an interesting hobby. This friend is
nurturing this hobby for more than 15 years and he has a good collection of
autographs of many famous personality of our country as well as some
internationally renowned persons.  
  
In the early childhood we were surprised to notice that he has a great courage
and patience to go near a famous person even in tight security and finally
taking this person's autograph. We sometimes enjoyed it and sometimes we found
our self surprised by the amount of effort and passion he could put on it.
Later on we thought that it is an adolescence passion would go away with time.
But surprisingly he still has this same hobby and few months back when he
showed me his collection of autograph, I was simply speechless. He has a
collection of more than 2000 autographs in his diary, books and in other
places including many world renowned writers, politicians, actors, players and
other famous people.  
  
I value his passion and inspiration of collecting the autograph and that's why
I possess a positive thinking about this hobby of my friend. Having some kind
of activity and passion is always positive and this helps us learning many new
things and experiencing many new things which otherwise would not have been
possible. So I would opine that this is a good hobby and I am proud of my
friend for his hobby and great collection.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your favourite song or piece of music.

**You should say:**

  * What kind of music it is
  * Where you usually listen to it
  * Why you like it

**and say what kind of mood this music puts you in.**

**Sample Answer:**  
The song 'High Hopes' sung by David Gilmour of Pink Floyd band is a song I
have loved always and would hear often for the rest of my life. Pink Floyds is
famous for their progressive and psychedelic music and high quality lyrics.
This song falls under the progressive rock music genre and was the 11th song
of the album Division Bell.  
  
I usually listen to this song in my computer and sometimes in my MP3 player
with the head phone. In fact I am a great fan of this music band and most of
their songs are in my favorite list. This song is specifically attractive for
the music composition, lyrics and theme.  
  
This song reminds the past and compares how greener and full of possibility it
was. The church bell and the lyrics make an out of the world illusion that
only people who love it would realize. Every time I hear this song, I can feel
my childhood, the sweet memory and the greener town I used to live. This is
song that opens a horizon for me to visit my past. I love this song from my
heart.  
  
This music puts me in a sad yet charming mood. I feel sad that the past days
won't be coming back and I won't have that childhood charm anymore. On the
other hand this song gives me a genuine pleasure of the memories of my
childhood and all the friends and people I knew then.

**Your ability to talk about this Cue Card would enable you to talk about the following Cue Cards as well:**

  1. Describe a song you often listen. 
  2. Describe your favourite song or singer. 
  3. Describe a piece of music you heard in your childhood. 
  4. Describe a famous song in your country. 

###  **Follow-up questions:**

**1\. What would life be like without music?**  
Life without music would be quiet and dull. What would we do at parties
besides eating and talking? That might as well be a meeting. Think about the
best party you’ve ever been to, how vibrant and outgoing everyone was.
Especially when everyone’s favorite jam came on. Music helps me focus on
projects when the house is soundless. In the past I would drive around town
aimlessly at night with nothing but music and my thoughts. This helped my
creativity tremendously.  
  
**2\. Which is more important to you, music or TV?**  
Although television takes up a big chunk of my life I could probably do
without it. Music on the other hand is irreplaceable. I’m thinking to myself I
could read the news &amp; also read a novel that the blockbuster movie was
adopted from. Consequentially, I cannot read a song. Novels are famously known
for being better than the movie. There is no possible way to hear music in any
other form. It all boils down to what can be replaced and what can’t.  
  
**3\. What kind of music do you like?**  
I’ve always had an infatuation with music since I was a kid. My family likes
to remind me of the time when I was two &amp; I learned to say “Jackson!
Jackson!” then hobble/hop around when his songs were played. Although my taste
for music has evolved &amp; diversified since then, music still holds a
special place in my heart. I listen to all types of music &amp; I am open to
new music. Having said that, as I am writing this I am listening to classical
music because it helps me concentrate and be more resourceful. The most common
type of genre I listen to is Hip-Hop or Rap. I really feel that rappers recite
more contemporary poetry.  There are a few R&amp;B artists I listen to
regularly.  
  
**4\. What musical genre do you really hate? Why?**  
I detest American Country music. It has got to be the lamest and depressing
music genre available to the public. I cannot pinpoint the exact reason why I
abhor this heinous excuse for music but I will try. Country music is extremely
patriotic, quite irritating. America is number one when most of the people
that listen to that type of music probably have never left the proximity of
their area code. Music CEO’s realize that white American population are losing
jobs to “foreigners” so country music artists use that and say white America
should love a pure America. It’s a clever way to be racist. When in truth no
one is a True American. The lyrics are too simple but try too hard to be
meaningful. Country music has a kind twang that I loathe. It will never grow
on me &amp; I try my hardest not to judge the people who listen to country
music.  
  
**5\. What do you think of music your parents listen to?**  
My father has the same affection, if not more, for music as me. While I was
growing up I have fond memories with the family &amp; there was always
traditional or classical Iranian music playing during these moments. Although
I don’t have any Iranian music on my computer &amp; never choose to listen to
Iranian music I do like some of it. However, I am not crazy about some of
today’s popular Iranian songs because they always seem to be furrowing their
brows while griping about love.  
  
**6\. Why do humans like music so much?**  
Without looking up scientific facts why the human species is drawn to music I
can muse that music has been a part of humans since the existence of man.
Cavemen created drums and hopped around to the beat while circling a fire.
Music evokes a feeling in people &amp; I think that at its core that is why
humans appreciate music so much.  
  
**7\. Why is music important to you?**  
Music plays an important role in my life. Whatever emotion I am feeling or
mood I am in I pair it with music. Some people listen to Adele when they are
sad or Pitbull when they are happy. Music is the soundtrack to my life.
Certain songs come on and it teleports me back to a moment while I was
listening to that same song, usually a happier time too.  
  
**8\. What influence do you think music has on life?**  
Music doesn’t influence me like it used to. When I was 12 I started listening
to hip-hop and it slightly influenced the way I dressed and somewhat how I
acted. Case in point, when I saw Dr. Dre wearing a black fitted baseball hat,
I always wore one. Now I am older and music doesn’t have that type of
influence on me but some music does affect my behavior or mood. If I am
listening up-tempo music it usually goes well with a party or my good music,
whereas slower tempo music helps me relax and unwind.  
  
**9\. What is the best time and place to listen to music?**  
That’s the beauty of music; you can almost always listen to music. I feel the
best time to have music is in social gatherings. When you are with close
friends and you create a soundtrack for that occasion. At the same time, a
meeting where you are trying to work is not an appropriate time to listen to
any kind of music; even white noise.

to-have-in-your-home&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a painting you would like to have in your home.

**You should say:**

  * what is it
  * how you know about it
  * how much it would cost you

**and explain why you want to have it in your home.**

**Sample Answer: **  
‘The Creation of Adam’ painted by Michelangelo is the painting that I would
like to have in my house. This is a painting that forms the part of the
Sistine Chapel Ceiling and it illustrates the Biblical creation narration of
human from the book of Genesis. This picture depicts the creation of human
where God breathes the life in to Adam. This is considered to be one of the
finest works ever done by a painter and only rivaled by two other great
painting: Mona Lisa and The Last Supper.  
  
 I saw a picture of this painting in our history book when I was in high
school and then I was amazed by the painting and the idea of the painting. I
am sure this painting is priceless and no individual would be able to own it
and hang it in his/her house. But I can buy a copied version of this painting
which would cost me around $90.

When I looked at the painting in my early childhood, I was enthralled by the
idea and fine work of this painting.  This was the painting that inspired me
to learn more about painting and greatest work of mythological paintings.
Later I learned about other great paintings by Michelangelo and by other
greatest artists. Furthermore, every time I look at this picture, I feel the
overwhelming joy of creation, human race and divinity. Because of this I would
like to have this picture (more accurately the copy of the original one) in my
home.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a person whom you like to work or study with.

**You should say:**

  *     Who is he/she
  *     When you work/ study together
  *     What do you often do together

**and explain why do you like to work with him/her.**

**Sample Answer:**  
I have many colleagues and co-workers whom I think to be very proactive and
talented and among them I would like to mention (…say a name…) whom I really
enjoy to work with. I have been working with him for the last 2 years and
during this time I have always found him to be very talented, focused and
deadline oriented co-workers. With him all of my assignments and tasks were
completed with perfect harmony and time.  
  
Since both of us work in the same office, we work for the same company but we
often work in different projects. When we both are assigned in the same
project, we work almost most of the office time together.  
  
In office, we mostly spend our time like two good colleagues and besides this
he has become a good friend of mine. We often go to near a lake to have some
fresh air, we go to restaurant to have our lunch and sometimes we meet other
friends. In the office we often discuss the tasks and share our opinion on how
to solve an emerging issue.  
I like to work with him mostly because of his pro-activeness and talent. He is
a very good problem solver and always shows a professional and positive
attitude to address a solution. He is a good team member and can work really
hard to solve a problem. Apart from those qualities, he is a good listener and
knows when to talk and when to remain silent. These are some great and
exemplary qualities someone would seek from a team member and because of all
these good qualities I enjoy and like to work with him.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a skill you want to learn.

**You should say:**

  *     What it is
  *     Why you think it is important
  *     How you are going to learn it

**and explain why you want to learn this skill.**

**Sample Answer: **  
If I ever get the chance to learn a new skill, I would like to learn karate
which is a form of martial art. I had a great fascination and attraction to
learn it but never had the chance actually to learn it. This is important for
keeping a sound body and to remain fit. It is also a great weapon of self
defense in time of adversity and sudden attack by rouge people.  
  
The greatest benefit this karate offers is a discipline and self control.
Besides the physical exercise, patience and hard work karate requires a great
deal of mental power, calmness and a type of discipline which are necessary
for a modest life.  
  
If I get the chance, I would get admitted in a good karate learning training
center that would offer a really good training so that I can efficiently learn
it. I will need to devote a great deal of regular time and will have to have
the determination to learn the necessary skill.  
  
I would like to get involve in some kind of activity which is helpful to keep
the body and soul sound. Physical exercise is one way to do that but karate
would be more helpful as it would require steady patience and determination as
well. I have found some of my friends and relatives found it very helpful in
their lives and I was inspired by their discussion regarding the usefulness of
this martial art.

long-to-make&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a decision that took you long to make.

**You should say:**

  * What was it
  * When you had to take it
  * Why it took you so long

**and explain how you felt after you took your decision.**

**Sample Answer: **  
After finishing my graduation, I applied for few jobs and luckily I was
offered a job in a large company. The work environment, the environment, the
learning facility, salary structure and management were very good and I was
very satisfied to work there.  When I had to decide between continuing my job
and doing my Masters, I was so perplexed that it took more than one month to
decide which one to pick. The M.Sc. program offered by the university required
a student to attend the classes at day time and that contradicted my office
timing. I had to pick one of these two options and my parents wanted me to
finish my M.Sc. first.

I felt like having a great dilemma and had to think a lot to decide. The time
I tool to decide what to do took a long time mostly because, I was not sure
which one should I put more priority: job or study? My parents were in favour
of study when some of my friends advised me to continue the job and then
getting enrolled in an evening Master’s program. This dividend opinion and
advices made me more confused. Another reason which caused this delay of
taking decision was the time I had in my hand. I was not bound to decide in a
day or in a week since I had one month’s time in my hand to decide. I had
different thought in this period and sometimes I thought of continuing my job
while in other time I thought to put more priority on my regular Master’s
degree.

After I decide to continue my job and doing the masters in a different
university that offers executive M.Sc. program, I felt like a heavy burden had
fallen from my head. I talked to my parents and finally they agreed that doing
an executive Master’s Degree would not be a bad idea. I felt great as I loved
the job that I had. I felt good as I had been able to continue both of the
important things I had at that time.

**Alternative Answer:**  
My decision to move to the capital city alone for my high school education
took a very long time. My father was a government service holder and we used
to stay in an urban area which was far from the capital. After I did a
promising result in my primary level, I started dreaming about studying in a
really big and reputed school in the capital city. I was in a position to
decide either to abandon my dream or to leave parents and siblings. I was
around 10 years old at that time and could not decide which option I should
pick.

My mid was oscillating and I was in a great dilemma. I did not want to leave
my beloved and dearest family members but on the other hand I could not
discard my dream of getting admitted in a well-established school. It took me
almost 1 year to finally decide and it was a tough decision to make for a 11
years’ old boy. I planned to move to the capital city with two other
classmates I had and I planned to spend all of my holidays at home.

I felt good about my decision. I started feeling the necessity of reading in a
good school and at the same time I missed my family members. Initial few days
were very tough for me. I got bored sometimes for being very far from my known
world but that helped me to concentrate to my studies more. I chose my study
as my salvation of home-sickness and boredom.

Deep inside my heart I knew that I made this sacrifice at an earlier age for a
greater good and someday I will get the result of my sacrifice. I knew I had
to go ahead and someday I will be able to be with my family members again.
Still now I feel that it was a very thoughtful and prudent decision though it
took me a whole year to decide.

source&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about your favourite news source.

**You should say:**

  * Why you use this source
  * How often you use this news source
  * What other sources you use

**and explain why you use this source for news.**

**Model Answer: **  
If I wanted to talk about the best news source, I would definitely pick TV
channels as the superior medium. In the first place, it is really available
almost everywhere. I usually turn to TV channels on a daily basis when I
return home from work. I guess it is designed to hold the viewers attention
for a short period of time which seems a perfect fit for today’s fast-paced
life. In the second place, it presents the most recent round-up on the news
providing the opportunity for us to see and enjoy live incidents by reporters
on the scene. That’s why shared viewing of TV programs can bring families
together even for a while. So, I always count on TV as a handy, reliable and
efficient source of news.

In fact, TV is my favourite source for news and I watch TV news almost daily.
With the fast pacing life, it is often tough to totally concentrate on radio
news or daily newspaper and that's why for the last few years the TV news
programs are becoming more and more popular. I can turn on my TV set and there
are plenty of dedicated news channels to watch. The handiest part of the TV
news is that you do not have to get 100% engaged on the TV set. I can do other
things at the same time the news updates get in my ear.



The audio-visual presentation, the detailed coverage and modern facilities
have made the TV news really easy to grasp. For all those reason my personal
favourite source of news is Television.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about something you like doing during the winter.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * When and where you usually do it
  * Why you do it

**and explain why you do this in the winter.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Winter usually lasts for three months in our country and apart from the
extreme winter days, people enjoy this season. The lifestyle of people in
summer and winter differs from some angels and we often do things in winter
that we do not like to do in summer season. One activity that I particularly
enjoy dinging the winter season is playing badminton.  
  
It has become a custom in our country to play the badminton during the winter
season. At the beginning of the winter season I ask some of my friends to
prepare a badminton court near our home and then arrange other equipments and
tools that we need to play this game. Usually after 8:00 we gather in the
playground and play for about two hours.  
  
Playing badminton is a good way of exercising and I love to play this game.
This is a great way physical exertion as well as an enjoyable game. Apart from
that it helps our friends to have a reason to get together even in our tight
and busy schedule. For all these reason I like this particular activity during
the winter season.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an animal that lives in the water.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * How you know about it
  * Is it common in your country

**and describe the animal.  **

**Sample Answer: **    
Whale is an animal that lives in the water and it is the largest animal among
the living creatures in the world. The whales usually inhabits in the oceans
all around the world and the size varies from 80 to 150 feet. They usually
have a lifespan of average 77 years and some whales live over a century.  
  
I have heard about this large water animal in my text book when I was in the
kindergarten and later I have seen this animal and their characteristics in
different TV channels. No, this is not a common water animal in our country.
In fact fishes are the most common water animal in our country and very few
whales could be found in the ocean in our country.  
  
This is the largest ever known animal in animal kingdom which lives in water
and is known as marine mammal animal. The average whales can be 30 meters long
and they can have more than 180 tones weight. They are long-lived animals and
some whales live over 100 years. Whales breathe air, like other mammals, and
they are warm blooded, feed milk to their infants and have body hair.  
  
Whales are considered to be an animal that learn, teach, cooperate and even
grieve like other mammal animals. Whales can make extremely loud sound which
is known as whale song and these sounds are their communication media. It is
generally considered that whales are predators but they also eat various other
foods like plankton and other animals. Whales that have teeth often eat fish
and squid which they mostly hunt using the echolocation.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a poisonous plant you know about.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * where this plant is found
  * advantages and disadvantages of this plant

**and explain how you know about it.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Angels trumpet, more specifically Brugmansia,is a poisonous plant which is
available in our country and I have seen this plants many times in different
locations in my hometown. Brugmansia have large and fragrant flowers and this
is the most probable reason they are called angel’s trumpets. This plant is
very closely related to the genus Datura. They are either semi-woody or shrub
plants with pendulous and large flowers and they do not have any spines on
their fruits.  
  
This plant can be found in tropical areas of the world and since my country is
a tropical country, this is found in my country as well. This plant has some
medical values and alkaloids found in this plant are used to make medicines
like anti-asthmatic, anticholinergic, spasmolytic, and anesthetic. Traditional
usages of this plant include the treating of pains and aches.  
  
This plant is highly toxic and the flower can cause disorder and
hallucinations. The flower and the plants part can be very dangerous for
children and we need to keep away the children from putting it in their mouth.  
  
I mostly know about this plant from my childhood when the elder person
prohibited us to go near this plats and strictly prohibited us from touching
the flowers. Then I came to know that this plant is poisonous and later on I
did some googling to find out the details of this plant. This is how I learned
about this plant and its usages and toxicity.

want-to-buy&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about an electronic device you want to buy.

**You should say:**

  * What it is
  * When you are planning to buy it
  * How much it would cost you

**and explain why you want to buy it.**

**Sample Answer: **  
I have a personal fascination about the electronic devices and among my very
personal belongings, the number of electronic devices form the majority part.
The need for latest electronic devices is never-ending and that is why I often
feel to replace my old TV with a new one or want to purchase a new music
system when I found it as a new arrival item in the market.  
  
One such electronic device that I would like to purchase is a washing machine.
I have a washing machine at my home but it is more than 4 years old and I feel
the need to buy a new one. The model that I have in mind would require a good
amount of money and I am planning to buy it early next year. It would cost me
around 1200 USD. Since this is a branded product the price might vary at the
time I would purchase it.  
  
The washing machine that I currently have requires some manual works and I am
planning to buy a new washing machine that would require very few manual works
to have my laundry work done. The numbers of clothes that need washing have
increased dramatically over the year and it has become cumbersome for me to do
all those laundry works using the old one. Furthermore the old washing machine
does not have any facility to dry the clothes and as a result I have to take
the burden to take all the dresses on the roof top and have them dried out in
the sunlight. The rainy season sometimes make it very difficult and that’s why
I am planning to replace it with a new one that would facilitate me to dry out
the clothes as well.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a relaxing day you had once after a period of hard work or study.

**You should say:**

  * when you had this relaxing day
  * where you spent this day
  * who you spent it with and what you did

**and explain why it was relaxing.**

**Model Answer:**  
It was mid-summer 3 years back when I joined my first job after the graduation
and as it was a project based job I had to work really hard. There was a
deadline for a client’s project and the team I worked with had been desperate
and determined to meet the deadline. Though I was a new member of the team,
they expected me to participate with my maximum effort. I was bit worried at
first and felt bit perplexed to have such type of pressure just after joining
the job but later I took it as challenge and started working hard. After 3
weeks’ of non-stop work and review, finally we were able to deliver the
project in time and the office declared 3 days off for the team as well as a
bonus. It was Friday and I remember having a very relaxing day. In fact I
spent the whole three days with much more relaxation than usual days.  
  
I left my bed at around 10:00 am and spent the day mostly at home. In the
evening I went to meet a friend and went to watch a movie in the theatre. At
night we had dinner together with 2 others friends and I returned home at
around 11:30 pm.  
  
It was a relaxing day mostly because I felt it as a reward after a really hard
work and effort. I had such many days but that day was exceptional because I
mentally felt it as a really relaxing day. Naturally I was feeling good to be
able to finish such a tough project and I had three days’ off and that’s why
did not fell to go to office next day. The situation, the routine free life,
the contempt and the leisure activities after a long made the day a really
enjoyable and relaxing day.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a hobby of someone in your family has.

**You should say:**

  * Whose hobby it is
  * Where and when s/he do it
  * Why s/he enjoys it

**And say if you would enjoy doing the same thing or not, and why.**

**Sample Answer: **  
My younger sister has a hobby that I found interesting and this is a rare
hobby in my experience. My younger sister’s name is (_…say a name…._) and she
is a bright and intelligent girl. Her academic record is enviable and she had
been the headline of our local newspaper for her extraordinary merit in
mathematics.  
  
She has a hobby of collecting famous persons’ picture from newspaper. She
already has more than 5 volumes of album which are full of the faces of famous
people. She has maintained an index for the famous person’s name and all of
the pictures were collected from the local and international newspapers. She
had few others hobbies that I noticed different times including blog writing
and stamp collecting but I have never found her that much fascinated with
other hobbies as I found her with the current one she has.  
  
One day she told me that when she would be around 26 years old, she would make
a Guinness record for the hobby she has. I am not sure if that’s going to be
fulfilled or not but I find her hobby very interesting. We have 2 newspapers
in our house and she mostly collects the pictures of famous persons from those
newspapers. Sometimes she goes to nearby library that has almost all the local
and international newspapers and she had made a way to having the pictures
from the old newspapers from this library.  
  
I have thought about her hobby several times and I venerate her hobby and I am
sure the hobby helps her to learn about the famous persons. But personally for
me, I would not be that much interested to have the same hobby. First of all,
adopting this particular hobby would put me in a position that others would
think that I have simply copied my sisters idea and I have greater interest on
blog writing and collecting coins that collecting pictures from newspapers.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about an article you recently read in a magazine or in a newspaper.

**You should say:**

  * when you read it
  * what was it about
  * was it a good or bad news

**and explain how you felt after reading the news.**

**Sample Answer: **  
I usually read a newspaper daily and I also enjoy reading some technology and
lifestyle related magazines. There are lots of interesting, thought provoking
and intriguing articles that I often confront and today I would like to talk
about one such article that I recently read from a newspaper.  
  
It was about the environment changes and our portion of contribution on that.
This is not a new topic but the article I am taking about was written in a
different perspective. It highlighted that changes that happened in the last
one decades and how this changes have already impacted our environment and
life. I read this article 2-3 weeks ago and this was written by a famous
environmental scientist and researchers.  
  
I am bit confused whether should I say it as a bad news or good news since
this is a research and statistical fact type articles that showed the
environmental changes in recent years, the impact of it in our lives and in
other species, then it showed our ignorance about the severity of this
pollution and changes then finally some solution to minimize the problem. The
first few parts are like bad news as it describes how much we have already
damaged to the environment but the final part of the news/ article shows the
light of hope and explained that we still have the opportunity to save the
disaster. Some of the solutions were proposed and that I consider being good
news.

I have read numerous articles about the ozone layer, extinction of some
species in the recent years, then the danger of health for the pollution and
many more similar topics but this one was written in a different perspective
and tried to explain that small changes in our perception and habit can save a
lot. This article alerted us and then showed us our unawareness of the issue
and then gave the hope of making positive changes. I felt like I have adopted
a different perception about this triggering issue and felt the need to read
more on the topic. The news helped me understanding our immediate attention to

sample%2F1107-ielts-cue-card-sample-243-describe-the-happiest-person-you-
know&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe the happiest person you know.

**You should say:**

  * who this person is
  * how you know this person
  * how he shows happiness

**and explain why you consider him/ her to be the happiest person you know.**

**Sample Answer: **  
Happiness is hard to define and so does the happiest man. Sometimes the people
we think are very happy confess that they have great sufferings and sorrows in
their lives. However, if we spend a great deal of time with someone and if we
can observe him/ her closely, then we can make a very good assumption of his
characteristics and his ideas.  
  
I would pick my friend (_…say a name of your friend…_) to be the happiest
person I have ever met or seen. He is my friend from the early childhood and
in my opinion he knows the value of being happy and no matter what happens, he
is contented and that makes him happy.  
  
I first met him in my high school and we both of us used to do debate
together. Thus the closeness and friendship grew between us and later on our
friendship grew even further when we got admitted in the same university.  
  
He has a positive attitude and he is very contented with whatever he has.
That’s attitude and positive thinking makes him happy. He does not woe for
thinks undone or bad things that happened to him. I heard him saying that life
is hard and you can be happy if you are happy in your mind. That’s something I
agree and I have found him to be happy in his mind even from the worst
experience.  
  
He always smiles and never regret for the things undone like others. He feels
that happiness is inside us and our positive attitude can make us happy. He
has a positive attitude of removing the negativity of life. He loves to enjoy
the fuller possibility of life and he has a charismatic character to make his
friends happy.  
  
For the positive and satisfied mentality he possesses and the happy behaviors
he shows always make me consider him to be the happiest person I have ever
known.

**Alternative Answer: **  
In my opinion my 12 years old nephew is the happiest person I have ever seen
or met. His name is Christopher _(... or say a name you like...)_ and I
consider him to be happy and jolly all the time. Since he is still very young
and has a very positive mentality, he is indeed a happy person.

We live in a joint family and my nephew Christopher was born in our house. In
fact I know him from his early days. I know him for the last 12 years as I
have seen him grown up in from of me. It is amazing that he has turned to be a
12 years young boy but to me it seems like he is still a child.

The complexities of life have not touched him yet. He inherited the positive
attitude from his father who always tries to be in good and positive mood no
matter what. As twelve years old boy, my nephew is still very innocent. He
possesses a positive and good mentality and that helps him to be a happy
person. He does not seek for luxury and tries to be contended with whatever he
has and that's a great weapon to lead a happy life. He is physically strong,
plays outdoor games and does not foster anxiety. He tries to find happiness
even in his time of trouble and for all those positive mentality and
behaviours he has taken life as a pleasant and meaningful journey.

He is happy because he is mentally satisfied and contended. Happiness is
pretty tough to define but it is sure that it is a state of positive and
contended mind and my nephew Christopher has it all.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an educational trip you have gone on in your school time.

**You should say:**

  * where was the trip
  * what you did and what you learned
  * who went with you

**and explain why it was important to you.**

**Sample Answer: **  
When I was in class six, the school authority arranged an educational tour to
the city botanical garden. I was very much interested to participate in it and
after I got my parent’s permission, I enrolled in the trip. It was a trip to
the largest botanical garden called (…say a name…) and we were almost 30
students and 5-6 teachers in the trip.

After we reached the garden I was very much enthralled to watch such a
beautiful place that seemed very green and different from the place we lived.
The journey took 3-4 hours and I enjoyed my visit a lot. The place very large
and there were several thousands of trees, some hills, lakes etc. the large
trees gave us the impression of the woods and I felt like we came to visit a
large woods of a mediaeval age. The teachers introduced us with several plants
and flowers and there were many plants and flowers that I read or heard about
but have never seen before that day.

We learned about the importance of forests, the necessity and our
responsibility to make the world a better place for all the species and not
just for humans only. We learned some medical and herbal aspects of many trees
and one of the teachers explained how the plants and their ingredients are
still used to make life-saving medicines. The whole trip was educational and
enjoyable as well.

This was a very important trip for me as I had the scope to visit such a
beautiful place surrounded by green trees and flowers. I learned many things
about the plants and their usefulness. I also learned about the natural
equilibrium and why should we maintain a greener environment for our own
betterment.

##  Describe what you like to wear on special occasions.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * On what occasion you wear this
  * Do other people wear the same dress in special occasions?

**and explain why do you like to wear this dress.**

**Sample Answer: **  
The type of dress I wear on special occasions mostly depends on the occasion
types and the custom of dresses people usually wears in those occasions.
However, for majority of the special occasions, I like to wear formal pants,
shirts, suits and formal shoes.  
  
I usually wear it to participate in any meeting, social pragmas like wedding,
birthday celebration, official a program arranged by a relative. Yes, this is
a common dress that many other people wear on those sorts of occasions. But
some people wear different dresses as well. The teenagers who attend social
programs usually wear jeans and t-shirts but the adults mostly wear this
dress.  
  
This dress code is a safe one to wear. First of all this dress matches the
weather all around the year in my country. Secondly, this is a dress which is
safe to wear as people won’t criticize people who usually wear this dress on
special occasions. This dress does not catch much attention and would give an
impression that the person is rightly dressed.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a foreign product you would like to buy.

**You should say:**

  *     What it is
  *     Why you want to buy it
  *     Does it have any special feature

**and say why you want to buy it.**

**Sample Answer: **  
In our country we produce many products that we export to many other countries
and on the contrary we import many foreign products from food to electronic
devices. The foreign product that I would like to buy is a Japanese car. The
car is manufactured by a famous Japanese automobile manufacturing brand named
Nissan and I would like to buy a latest car of this brand.  
  
I do not have a car and I have been planning to purchase one for the last 2
years. I started saving a budget and I guess I am now ready to own a car of my
own. I went through the cars available in our country and did some research in
internet about the available cars in our city and found Nissan car as a
suitable one for my need. The price is affordable for me and the facilities
this car offers, match my requirement.  
  
Yes, the auto navigation by map is a new feature of this car and it would help
me to find new locations very easily using GPRS facility with this car. As I
have already said, the car model I have planned to buy is a good one in terms
of the budget and facilities it offer. This is a good car within my reach and
that’s the main reason I want to buy it. Furthermore, Japan has a reputation
of producing finest quality cars and in my opinion purchasing a car
manufactured by a famous Japanese automobile manufacturing company would be a
good deal for me.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a conversation you had in the past, which is very important to
you.

**You should say:**

  * whom you had it with
  * when it was
  * what your learned from it

**and explain why you consider it to be an important conversation you had.**

**Sample Answer: **  
We remember many conversations that help us chose our course of action while
there are many conversations that we wish we did not have. The conversation
that motivates us/ guides us and teaches us value and morality of something
are remembered by us.  
  
I had a conversation with my high school history teacher that I consider very
important. His name was (…say a name…) and he used to take our history classes
in my high school level. The conversation took place many years ago when I was
around 16 years old. One day I went to his room to submit an assignment and
then all of a sudden the conversation started.  
  
The conversation covered many things related to my education, some of the
important facts of history, our morality and necessity of learning history in
order to shape the future.  
I was mostly a listener of the conversation but I opined often when he made a
remark and I also asked questions during the conversation.  
  
The conversation was interesting as he was a person who had a great ability to
judge the listener and to motivate the other party. I was listening very
attentively as he told many international events and some of our national
events that has changed the world. I felt a great enthusiasm about reading the
history after the conversation. I started visiting the central library after
that day and since then I have read many books which I considered to be
treasures that I found.  
  
The conversation specifically motivated me and pointed out the importance of
learning about the history and finally how to use my brain when there are
different versions of history specially which are related to political events.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a journey that took longer than you expected.

**You should say:**

  * When you took the journey
  * Where you went
  * How you went there

**and explain why it took longer than expected.**

**Model Answer: **  
The journey that I would like to talk about took almost 3-4 times more than we
expected and it was 2 years back when I was in the 2nd year in my university.
After the semester break one of our friends offered us to have a visit to his
hometown which was near a very beautiful location with hills and rivers
surrounding it. We were very fascinated to have a visit there because of the
chance to visit this part of our country which is a very famous tourist spot.  
  
My friend’s hometown was in (say a place name) and we started our journey at
around 7:30 am. It should have been a 6-7 hours journey and the first 2 hours
went very well. We took a bus to go there and after 2 hours we noticed a heavy
traffic in front of us. The bus was stuck at the same place for about an hour
and we heard that there was an accident and that caused the bad traffic. After
another 30 minutes, our bus started moving on but it was like slowly pacing in
the sand. The speed was not more than 20 km/hour and we got really bored being
in such a bad situation. The whole journey took around 22 hours and we were
very frustrated to be caught in such a bad position. When we reached our
friend’s house, we were all tired and I wished I did not decide to have the
journey.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a book you have at home.

**You should say:**

\- What it looks like  
\- What the topic of the book is  
\- Where you got the book from

**and explain why you have kept at home.**

**Sample Aswer: **  
I have a good collection of books at my living room and the number would
approximately more than 1000. I got some books as gifts and most of the others
books were either bought by me or by my father.  
  
Among those books “The Republic” by the Greek philosopher Plato is a book that
I think is important and that’s been in my collection for a long time.  
  
The book cover is a combination of red and yellow and it has several geometric
shapes as well as the sculpture of the Plato himself. The back cover has a
critical review of the book and other details of the publisher and printing
details.  
The book is a Socratic dialogue, written by Plato around 380 BC and this was
concerning the definition and implementation of justice. This book is
considered to be Plato's best work and it has proven throughout the ages to be
one of the most intellectually, influential and historically important works
of philosophy as well as political theory. The book also discusses the
immortality of the soul, the theory of forms, the roles of the philosopher,
the social structure, justice and its intricacies and poetry in society.  
  
This was a book bought by my father as I have seen it from my early childhood.
The binding and papers of the book were so good that the book still seems in
new condition. I have read it once and thoroughly enjoyed the content of it.
This book has amazed me and had opened lots of thought provoking topics in
front of me.  
  
This book was bought by my father and it is one of his most favorite books.
This is the main reason we have kept it with utmost care. Furthermore this is
a book worth reading and I consider it as one of the most valuable book at our
home and that’s why we have kept it with care.

tour-you-took&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an excursion or education tour you took.

**You should say:**

  * When it was
  * What you did
  * What you learned from it

**and explain why you liked or disliked it.**

**Sample Answer: **  
I went on many excursions and study tours from my college and in university
level as well and the tour I would like to talk about was in 2004 when I was a
college student. The college notice board one day declared that there would be
an education tour to the central museum and the interested persons are invited
to place application form and money to the authority.  
  
I was interested and when I found that my close friends from the college would
also go, I asked my father for the permission to take part in the excursion.
On the day, I went to the college ground and found that other students and
teachers have already gathered there. The bus left at 7:30 am and we reached
the museum at around12:00 pm. Though many of my friends already went to the
central museum, I never went there before the study tour from our college.  
  
I enjoyed everything I watched there and our history teacher was explaining
many of the things preserved in the museum. That day I realized how exciting
the study tour can be. It gives both the opportunity to learn and enjoy.  
  
We took our lunch in the museum canteen with the foods we took with us and in
the evening we returned to our hometown approximately at mid night. I learned
about the past history of our country, some of the old custom and practices we
had in our country, many significant evidence of the history and the life and
work of famous people of our country.  
  
Actually I enjoyed the tour very much and as a result I still remember it.
This time I learned that, there are some other ways of learning things apart
from attending classes. The excursion was so interesting to me that I planned
to travel extensively in my life at that very day.

wanted-to-buy&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something you have always wanted to buy.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * how long you wanted to buy it
  * why you wanted to buy it

**and explain what you would do after you buy it.**

**Sample Answer: **  
I have always wanted to buy a flat near a lake and open space. My father has
his own home where I used to live until I had to move to a new city for my
job. Currently I am living in a rented house in the metropolitan city for my
job and yet I have a great desire to own a house of my own that would be a
large house with lots of rooms and which would be near a lake or river.  
  
I have wanted to buy this house most probably after I moved to the new city
where I am currently residing. I wanted a house of my own where I would have
my family members and that would give me freedom of living. The house would be
near open space and close to nature. It is almost impossible to have such a
house in the metropolitan city I am currently living in. I have the plan to
return to my hometown, buy this house and then start a business of my own.  
  
I will have the house decorated and arranged in the way I have always wanted.
I will have my family members to move to this house. I will keep an open space
in front of this house and I will grow many plants and flowers in this open
space.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe one of your classmates.

**You should say:**

  * Who was s/he
  * What class you read together
  * What you two did together

**and explain why you still remember him/her.**

**Sample Answer: **  
Throughout my academic years, I had many good classmates with whom I spent a
significant amount of time and did many interesting stuffs. Some of them
became my long term friends in a later time. One of my classmates whom I would
like to talk about is Ron who later became a good friend of mine.  
  
I met him at class six after I got admitted in the high school and in the
first day of my school, he sat next to me. We started reading together from
class six to class ten and after that he got admitted in to a different
college. So we studied together for more than 5 years and during these years,
we did lots of things together including preparation for the exam, playing,
making stuffs and visiting different places of our hometown. We often played
in the evening together and sometimes we were in the same team and thus
enjoyed the games. He often came to my house to watch TV and we mostly watched
interesting TV programs. Before the exams, we used to study together and share
our notes and other study materials. I remember learning swimming and riding a
cycle together. We often used to walk in the bank of rivers and enjoyed our
stays.  
  
As we have been very close for few years, we had some minor quarrels as well.
But those were not very serious as to interrupt our relationship. Most of the
days we used to sit close in the classes and shared our books and notes as
well.  
  
I mostly remember him because he was a good classmate and a friends a well. We
spent good times together and since we had been together for a long time, I
have many happy memories regarding the things we used to do together. And
that’s why I still remember him.

or-tv-serial&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a character from a movie or TV serial.

**You should say:**

  *     Who is he/ she
  *     What part s/he had in the movie / TV serial
  *     How s/he acted

** and explain why you admire this character in the movie or TV serial.**

**Sample Answer: **  
’Vito Corleone’ the legendary character created by the acclaimed author Mario
Puzo in the Godfather movie is a character I really liked. This is a
fictitious character from a book of the same title, ‘The Godfather”, and this
was a very successful character of the movie industry.  
  
‘Vito Corleone’ was listed as the greatest movie character in history by the
Premier Magazine and it is also considered to be one of the best 10 greatest
characters in movie by the Empire magazine. In fact, this is a character none
would forget if he enjoys The Godfather movie. This character was performed by
Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro (earlier stage of the Don’s life). Vito
Corleone was the mafia head of the Corleone mafia family of New York City who
was migrated from Sicily.  
  
The acting was superb and through out the movie he had been successful to
create an image that people will remember always. His acting was so profound
that many people imagine a mafia don based on the character he has performed.
I enjoyed the sequels of The Godfather movie and was deeply touched by the
life of the mafia don himself. The perfect acting, the dialogues and the
influences the character had is simply impeccable and depicts the story
perfectly. This is the reason I still believe that the ‘Vito Corleone’ is one
of the greatest character in movie history.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something which is produced in your country (e.g. a food, a
handicraft, or a car).  

**You should say:**

  * what the product is
  * what it is used for
  * how it is made

**and explain why your country produces this thing.**

**Model Answer: **  
We produce a lot of products which we consume or export in other countries and
among those products sports items are very famous. In our country we produce
fine quality game products like football, cricket bats, stamps and jersey. The
cricket bats which are produced in our country are used in many cricket
playing countries as well as by the big events of ICC.  
  
The cricket bats are created from fine quality wood and some very professional
and experienced people work on that. The woods are first collected and dried
to omit the water portion from it. Then the wood is cut in a shape similar to
a cricket bat structure. After the structure is given, the bat is then shaped
and fine-tuned to produce a good quality bat. Some mechanical helps are needed
to give the bats good shapes and to make it flawless. After that the bats are
covered with grippers and other stickers.  
  
Cricket is a popular game in our country and the materials and expertise which
are required to produce those bats are available in our country. A large
number of people have acquired the knowledge to produce this fine quality bats
and as there is a very good demand for those bats both in our country and in
other cricket playing countries, we produce those bats.

your country?

Q. Do you think the globalization of industry and commerce is a good thing?

Q. Do you think every country should make everything it needs or should it
import some things?

Q. What are the disadvantages of a country producing everything it needs?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about something you or someone you know collects.

**You should say:**

  * what s/he collects
  * how long s/he collects
  * how the collection is stored

**and explain why you / someone you know enjoys collecting it.**

**Sample Answer: **  
I would like to talk about an interesting hobby that one of my friends has.
The name of this friend is (…say a name…) and he collects coins and notes of
different countries and to my surprise he has already collected more than five
thousand coins and currencies of more than 100 countries. Many of those
currencies are no longer in use and they have become the antique pieces.

As far as I know, he is collecting the coins and currency notes for more than
a decade. I still remember him telling stories how he has managed to collect a
coin of 200 years old from his visit to an antique shop. This passion of
collecting coins and notes grew in him when he was a student of high school.
As he had a good collection, we all knew about him. Few years back, there was
an exhibition in our city and his coins and notes were exhibited in a gallery
room.

I am not pretty much sure how he collects those currencies and notes but I
have heard sometimes that he had to travel far away to participate in auctions
in order to collect coins.

Last time saw his collection, those were all stored in a notebook like albums
and he had made an index in order to arrange those coins based on their
origins.

Collecting something is a passion and has some educational values as well. I
am sure this friend of mine is really passionate about collecting the coins
and notes from different ages and countries. He must be very enthusiastic to
collect those.

you-were-a-child&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a naughty thing you did when you were a child.

**You should say:**

  * how old you were then
  * What you did
  * Why you did it

**and explain how do you feel about it now.**

**Sample Answer 1: **  
Childhood is magical and we remember our childhood with great joy. Even the
stupid things we have done in our childhood seems very exciting to us in our
later life. The naughty things that I did in my childhood are many and I will
mention a particular thing that I did when I was only 7 years old. I was in
grade two at that time and one day on my way to the school I found that some
of my classmates have gathered near a pond and they have planned to catch fish
from that pond. I forgot about my school and put the school bag in a nearby
tree. I was very excited about the whole idea of catching fish and then
cooking it for the dinner.  
  
I stayed for around 3-4 hours to catch the fish with my bare hand and with
some small nets my classmates had with them. After 2-3 hours I was tired and
was convinced that it was not an easy job to do. I found that my classmates
had become less interested by the time and they were planning to go home.  
  
By the time I realized that I have done a great mistake by skipping the school
and I have made my dresses dirty in the pond, it was too late. I was afraid
that my mother would be very angry if she finds out what I really did over
here. Then I talked with my classmates and found that they got anxious as
well. We were 3-4 in number and only one of us had been able to catch 2 small
fishes. We then made a decision to steal some fishes from the other people who
had already caught a good number of fishes and put them in their jars.  
  
We had been successful to steal some fishes from others and when I returned
home, I had 3-4 fishes in my bag. I was lucky to get over with the things I
had done and I still find it very funny and naughty thing to do in my
childhood. I have done many other naughty things later part of my life but
this was the event that still gives me real pleasure to think about.

**Cue Card Answer 2: **  
Well, this is an interesting topic and I can recall many such naughty events
from my childhood. I would, however, like to talk about an event when I went
to visit the Local Museum with two of my friends.  
  
I was about 9 years old and was in my grade three. One day our school was
declared off for some unknown reason just after an hour it started. That was a
pleasant surprise and a great joy for us. Instead of returning home, I planned
to go somewhere with two of my friends. One of the friends suggested that the
Local Museum would be a worth visiting place and we should go there. Without
thinking much, we rushed to the nearby bus station and took a local bus to
reach the city centre where the museum was located. We gathered all the coins
and money we had with us and bought three tickets of the museum. Luckily we
got 50% discount as students but we had to lie to the ticket seller and the
guard that we went there with one of our uncles who was inside the museum. The
guard had his suspicion but did not bothered much. We entered inside the
museum and spent almost three hours when all of a sudden I noticed that my
father with a police officer and a museum guard was walking toward us. I just
froze in fear and then noticed that my friends' parents were also there.  
  
That was a devastating moment for me and I found that two of my friends froze
green in fear and tension. My father came to me, grabbed my hand and asked me
whether I had eaten anything during the lunch or not. He also told me that my
mom was worried about my whereabouts. That was quite surprising for me but not
unusual for my father to behave very calmly when others lose their tempers. I
found that one of my friends was already being rebuked by his father. However,
my father is a great dad and quite different from other dads. He took me to a
nearby restaurant and ordered lunch for me as if we went there for a
celebration. He told me that my mother was so anxious and we should return
home quickly. He also told me that he cannot guarantee whether my mother would
become furious or would remain clam after I return home. I was happy that my
father had already understood what we did and he asked me to promise that I
would never do such thing ever again. I promised and then realized what my
father had to do to find me. He had to left his office, assure my mother,
visit my school, talk to people and then search everywhere. I was quite
curious to know how he found us but did not dare to ask. It must had already
been a great deal of effort and anxiety for my parents. I was feeling ashamed
at that moment and promised to myself not to do such thing ever again without
the permission of my parents.  
  
It took many years for me to find that it was a great moment and quite a
naughty thing to do as a grade three student. I do not feel much ashamed for
this event now as this was my first visit to any museum. My first visit to the
museum has become a great memory for me. As childhood is full of unexpected
events and most of those later become memorable and cherished part of our
childhood, this was such an event when I did a naughty and unexpected thing.

character-that-you-find-important&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a feature of your personal character that you find important.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * Is it a common characteristics
  * How it is helpful to you

**and explain why it is important to you.**

**Sample Answer: **  
Thank you very much for the topic. It’s kind of tough to talk about someone’s
own personal characteristics as I believe, the way we judge ourselves differs
from the perspective other people judge us. Nonetheless, we all have our own
idea about our own characteristics and I would like to talk about my ability
to stay calm even in the time of distress.  
  
I am not hot tempered and I try to remain clam no matter how severe the
situation and I find it as a helpful characteristics. From my own experience I
can say that, whenever I got very much vibrated and acted very promptly
without giving much consideration about the situation, I did not take the
right decision and I repentance for that.  
  
In my opinion that should be a common characteristics among other people but
my personal experiences sometimes contradicts my opinion as I often find
people who can’t remain calm in adverse situation and act very weirdly. So to
say, this is not a rare quality but many people lack it.  
  
Remaining calm and using brain rather than the tongue is a helpful
characteristic as it would help you taking the right decision and would show
you the right way and course of actions. Being very fragile in action and
taking prompt decision without thinking can sometimes lead us to
misunderstanding and can ruin relationship. Not being able to remain calm also
shows your weakness and that often allure you to take a completely wrong
decision.  
  
To me this is a very important characteristic. This quality has saved me from
making many mistakes and saved me from lamenting later on. Being able to
remain calm in an adverse situation helps me taking the right decision and
that’s something which I find very helpful in my personal and professional
life.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a special meal that you remember having.

**You should say:**

  * where you had the meal
  * who you were with
  * when you had it

**and explain why it was a special meal to you.**

**Sample Answer: **  
I had many meals and I took part in many celebrations and parties and among
them the meal I had with my teachers and classmates in my high school was a
very important one and I still remember it.  
  
I had the meal at our school community center. The meal was thrown as part of
the fare-well of our batch from the high school. The party was help in the
evening and our teachers, classmates and some of the members of the school
committee as well as our guardians were present. My father was present with me
and he was sitting next to me in the meal.  
  
This was a special meal because this was the last meal I had with my
classmates who had been my friend for more than 4 years. I was bit sad to
admit to myself that I won’t see most of them in my life again and I was happy
that I had such a good memory about my school, teachers and friends.  
  
There was a short speech by 2-3 of our teachers and by 2-3 guardians and after
that the meal was served. Many items were served in the feast and we all ate
voraciously as we were hungry. I enjoyed the desert very much. I returned home
at late night with my father and started feeling that I will never forget this
event and the good meal I had with my teachers and friends whom I might not
meet again.

sample%2F1233-ielts-cue-card-sample-279-describe-your-favourite-news-
source&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your favourite news source.

**You should say:**

  * How often you use it
  * What types of news you are interested in
  * What other sources you use

**And explain why this is your favourite news source.**

**Model Answer:**  
Daily newspaper is my favourite news source and I read newspapers daily. In
the morning I go through the headlines of two newspapers at my home. I read
newspapers at my workplace/ university during the lunch break and often I read
the details of the news and editorial in the evening. Thus newspapers are my
primary source of news and current events.

I read mostly current events, political news, sports news, business news,
financial and show-biz news and news-stories. Those are the types of news
items I feel most interested in. I also like the editorial and in-depth
coverage of international news as those news and writing give insight and
different viewpoints of a news or event. Apart from newspapers I sometimes
watch television and listen to radio and those two are good source of news
also. I use internet at home, at office/university and online news source like
news websites, online radio channels and news feeds are very handy sometimes.
I can collect most recent news updates and details from internet and nowadays
online news sources are getting very popular. When I drive my car, I rely on
radio news and at home I often watch television news. The online news portals,
news directories, blogs are good sources for authentic and comprehensive news.
I browse those sorts of news portals and websites at home and at university/
offices as well.

Among all the news sources I use, newspapers in my favourite source for
gathering news and getting updated. I find it very convenient, easy to access
and friendly to read. The newspapers are supplied by the local newspaper
distribution authority to my home and that’s why I can easily get it every
day. I can read it anytime I like, I can skip the news I do not feel
interested about and the news is presented in a suitable manner. In my
opinion, the news presented in a newspaper are well organized, well written,
authentic and based on the people’s interest and current events of the country
and the world. Personally I consider it as the best source of news for me and
I also believe a large percentage of total population in my country also rely
on this news source as their primary source for news and current events.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What is the most effective way of getting news?

Q. Do you think the information on the Internet believable or not?

Q. What do you think of the importance of privacy?

Q. How do journalists entertain their customers?

Q. How do people in your country gather information?

Q. What are the advantages and disadvantages of different media?

Q. What kind of news do you think should be controlled?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a school that you went to when you were a child.

**You should say:**

  * where the school was
  * when you went there
  * what the school and the teachers were like

**and explain whether you enjoyed your time there.**

**Model Answer:**  
_(…say your elementary/ primary school name…)_ was the first school I went to
and this is the school I will always remember. The school was in the middle of
my home town just behind the city hall. The school was located beside a big
park and a pond that gave it a nice view. I got admitted in this school when I
was only 4 years old and because of that everything was new to me. I had a
very positive vision about the school, teachers, friends and I was very lucky
to be in this school that taught me many important aspects of education and
life.

I studied in this school for about 3 years and I enjoyed my time there a lot.
The school was a nice place with a suitable environment for the kids. It was a
4 storied building of L shape and there were almost 200 students there. The
teachers were very helpful and very friendly. I never found them in rough mode
with students. Managing and taking care of 200 students is not an easy task
and to my surprise the teachers were very dedicated and caring to do that
perfectly.

They always treated us like their own children and there were numerous times
we got gifts from them. They have helped us a lot to prepare for our study and
also taught us about the values and ethics of life.

I enjoyed the environment of our school specially the big garden, play-ground
and canteen. I also enjoyed having such great teachers who were caring and
good humans. In the break time I used to play with my classmates and that’s
something I will never forget. The childhood is magical and pleasant and for
me this became even happier because of the school I went to.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a family business you know about.

**You should say:**

  * What type of business it is.
  * Who own this business.
  * What activities are involved in this business

**And explain your idea of this business.**

**Model Answer:**  
The family business I know and would like to talk about is owned by a joint
family in our community. It is a business related to floral business and this
is in fact quite a successful one. The family has a large flower garden and
they collect flowers from these gardens and then sell these flowers in their
floral shops.

Mr. Abraham is the founder chairman of this business and the business is
growing day-by-day. Now they own more than 5 acres of flower garden and they
have more than 50 shops where they sell the flowers they produce. As I heard,
they have started exporting flowers to neighboring countries as well. As I
have witnessed the rise and progress of this business, I think that was a nice
business model.

At the beginning they had only two small gardens and a small shop, and over
the years this business had expanded to a greater and bigger business.  
I think the business plan, hard work, dedication, timely decision, and luck
had favored the business and the family has become a renowned floral business
owner of the country.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a study tour or excursion you had.

**You should say:**

  * When it was
  * When you went
  * How you reached there

**And explain why you enjoyed it.**

**Model Answer:**  
We went to visit Mount Everest few years back as part of the study tour
arranged by our college. It was the year 2011 and I was in second year of my
college at that time. Since it was in a different country (Nepal), we had to
collect our visas to enter the country. From our country we flew to the Nepal
National Airport and from there we took a tour bus to reach the camping area
near Himalayas. After few hours journey, we reached the camping area and we
were very excited to be there. We were almost 30 members and four tour guides
with us.

Personally I was very much thrilled to visit the largest mountain peak and
when I reached the camping area, I got awestricken. It is beyond explanation
in words. The snow-covered mountain, balmy wind, the sound of nature, vast
wide area simply took my heart away. I stayed there for about a week and we
did some mount hiking and fire-camping and all of those activities were really
exciting and new for me. I enjoyed the nice vacation, natural scenery,
companion of my classmates and friends. That was relief from the busy city-
life and being close to nature. I enjoyed this tour so much that the whole
week seemed like passed away like a fleeting moment. I promised to myself
that, I will come back to visit the out-of-the-world place someday.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a house that you liked while visiting.

**You should say:**

  * Where it was
  * When you went there
  * How it looked like

**and explain why you liked this house.**

**Model Answer:**  
I went to visit Ireland _(…or say a different country/ city name…)_ after the
completion of my first semester. This would probably be the May, 2012 and as I
recall it was around 2 weeks’ visit. I went to visit _(…say a village or urban
area name…)_, a friend’s house and in this area there was a gigantic house
_(more specifically a castle)_ that caught my eyes.  
I heard that my friend’s father had a good connection that would allow us to
visit this castle. I went inside the house and walked from floor to floor and
it took me more than 4 hours.

This was a 200 years’ old castle and I saw a real castle for the first time in
my life during this visit. This was a great and different experience. I have
read about these castles and even saw them in the movies; but witnessing the
castle was something totally different. The castle was built with stones and
the area was more than 2 acres. The castle was surrounded by thin lakes and it
had well defense systems. Though there was no soldier or guard for war or
defense, yet it took me to the feudal age and the history revealed itself in
front of me.

The impression of this castle in me will last for a long time. The height of
the castle, the shiny stones, stairs, cryptic rooms, large gates gave a total
strange and different view than any other modern buildings I have seen. As
this was my first visit to any real castle, I was mesmerized. I have never
witnessed anything like this before. I liked the architectural design, height,
history related to this, gigantic buildings, defense system, open area, thin
lake, the cryptic rooms and war equipments of this castle.

sample%2F1129-ielts-cue-card-sample-264-describe-a-harmful-environmental-
problem&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a harmful environmental problem.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * How it is harmful
  * What harmful effects it creates

**and explain what can be done to prevent this environmental problem.**

**Sample Answer: **  
Speaking of environmental issues, I should own up to the fact that air
pollution is the most lethal one. In the first place, this air you are
breathing may be killing you or at least, it may exacerbate many already
existing diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and allergies. In the second
place, those who are most vulnerable to problems of air pollution are the
elderly and children. Pollution has a direct link to pulmonary problems in
developing fetuses, and damage to the immune system in adults. That’s why I
believe it is highly imperative for governments to take steps to reduce this
problem.

To prevent the air pollution the government must make and implement strict
laws and rules so that the citizens abide by those laws. The citizens have to
realize the air pollution must be prevented for their own benefits and for
healthy life.  
  
The number of industries and vehicles necessary for our lives cannot be
controlled, but we must make sure that the CO2 and other harmful gas those
vehicles and industries are omitting are not beyond the border line. We need
to plant more trees and make the environment greener to prevent the problems
related to the air.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

There are so many environmental problems and you can talk about one such
problem for this cue card. Following are some of the prominent environmental
problems that we all know and talk about. The list would help you brainstorm
and select one such topic to talk about.  
  
**1.    Sound pollution  
2.    Air pollution  
3.    Water pollution  
4.    Deforestation  
5.    CO2 omission  
6.    Global Warming  
7.    Flood  
8.    Land degradation  
9.    Over population  
10.  Acid rain  
11.  Electronic waste etc.**  
  
Since this cue card asks you to talk about a harmful environmental problem you
should talk about a particular environment problem rather than focusing on
multiple issues.  
  
First, clearly say the environmental problem and then give details how this is
created, who are responsible for that, how this is impacting the environment
and the severity of this problem in the future. Try to give some fact rather
than giving all hypothetical data and to support your argument give a thought
provoking question like ‘Are not we already aware of the issues of the (air)
pollution? Have not we noticed in recent years that this is getting worse than
ever? From my own experience I can see that this is getting even worse day by
day and if we do not take necessary steps to reduce it, we will be the
ultimate victims.”  
  
When you talk about an environmental issue, you need to present as an advocate
of the environmental thinkers. After you describe the problem and the severity
of it, now you need to move on the subject of proposing solution of it.
Mention that we are responsible for most of the pollutions that the
environment is facing today and we should start working from right now towards
the solution of it. Propose the importance of the awareness and humanity that
we individual should apply to contribute reducing this problem and then say
about the responsibility and the steps the government, social workers and
authority should take to actually diminish the environmental issues.

**Similar Cue Card Topics:**  
  
**1\. Describe a problem that you have in your community.  
2\. Describe an environmental issue that you think is important to focus.  
3\. Talk about an alarming issue in your country**

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a foreign musical festival that you enjoyed.

**You should say:**

  * When you enjoyed it
  * Where you enjoyed it
  * Who was there with you

**And explain why you enjoyed it.**

**Model Answer:**  
During my visit the United Kingdom (...or say a country name you prefer…) I
attended a musical festival there that I enjoyed thoroughly. I went there all
of a sudden when I was roaming the London city with one of my friends. I did
not even know about the musical program and when I noticed that few famous
singers would be joining the festival, I decided to attend there.

It was probably 2008 when I was in London to visit my sister’s house and at
that time I attended the festival. I am great enthusiast of music and I
usually enjoy music festivals. So I did not miss my change to attend this
festival. The location was second Hampton Street and the festival was in a
wide area. As I recall, as small fair and gathering was outside the auditorium
and I had to spend few money to enter the festival.

There were some solo performance by young and rising singers and they
performed really well. People applauded their performance very much. The
presenter told a great lot about the music and since there were many
foreigners, she also introduced the songs and singers in great details.
Finally she told about the music history and the history of England’s music
and musical instruments.

The cool breeze, the people with gaudy dresses, the music and singers took my
heart away. I was greatly touched with the local songs and when I saw one of
my very favourite singers in the stage, I got very much excited. The festival
was a different experience for me especially when it was in a different city.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an important letter you wrote to someone.

**You should say:**

  * When you wrote it
  * Whom you wrote it to
  * What it was about

**And explain why it was an important letter.**

**Model Answer:**  
One of the very important letters that I ever wrote was the one I wrote to the
councilor of our city corporation. As I recall, I wrote this letter when I was
only 16 years old. It was probably 2007 and I wrote this important letter to
get a solution for the repair of a bridge in our locality.

The letter was about the request of people of our community for repairing a
bridge that thousands of people use daily. This was an old bridge and after an
earthquake it was in a dangerous situation. The accident might have happened
anytime and the emergency repair work was needed. I wrote a letter to the
councilor of our city corporation stating the facts and many persons of our
locality signed on the back of this letter.

Writing this letter was very important as the councilor of the city
corporation was the right person to authorize the repair work of the bridge.
After I felt that we were in a great danger, I wrote that letter and amazingly
after few days the councilor came to visit the bridge and made necessary
arrangement to have it repaired.

I have written many letters and among them this one was related to an issue of
public safety. Since the prompt response was taken after I posted that letter,
I felt really good about it. For all these reasons, this letter was of the
most important letters I have ever written.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a form of exercise you used to do but no longer do now.

**You should say:**

  * What short of exercise it was
  * How long you did it
  * Why you stopped

**And say if you would like to do it again or not. why?**

**Sample Answer 1:**  
Ooh, it’s really fun to think about what to talk about for this topic!  I can
think of a great form of exercise I used to do but don’t any more.  I’m going
to tell you all about what sort of activity it was, how long I did it for and
why I stopped.  As to whether I’d like to do it again in the future, you’ll
find out later.

The exercise I did was called Body Combat, and I loved it at the time.  It was
a period of my life when I was working part time and studying for a post-
graduate qualification simultaneously so I was pretty busy.  To help me stay
fit and healthy I joined a local gym.  Knowing I find it hard to motivate
myself I signed up for some classes where there would be an instructor to
motivate me, and it was really by chance I ended up picking this activity.  It
just happened to be scheduled for days and times that fitted with my work and
stury timetable.

The classes were hilarious. They were hard work, because they were extremely
energetic, we worked through a number of routines to very loud music. The
exercises were apparently inspired by number of different disciplines and
martial arts such as karate, taekwondo, tai chi and boxing.  It was a great
way to get fit and lose weight too - calorie burning is easy as you kick and
punch through the workout.  Although our instructor took it all very
seriously, yelling at the class and ferociously demonstrating moves with high
kicks and punching, those of us who attended treated it all a bit more light-
heartedly.  I think you need a sense of humour if you are as uncoordinated as
me and trying to do a sequence of back high kicks and under-cut punches.  I’m
not even sure if I’m naming the moves correctly.  The rest of the group felt
the same as me, we often fell about with laughter as we tried to keep up with
the routines, much to the annoyance and frustration of our fitness coach.  I
went three times a week for about a year, and it was the fittest I’ve ever
been.

I was really sorry to give it up, but eventually I finished my masters (the
postgraduate course), and had to get a full time job, then there just was no
opportunity to get to the classes anymore. I did try one with a different
instructor, but that wasn’t nearly so much fun, the new teacher was a bit too
polite and it didn’t work as well.  Then I ended up relocating to a different
area and Body Combat classes don’t seem to happen where I now live, it is such
a shame.

I would love to do Body Combat again, though I’m older and stiffer now, I
don’t know if I’d be able to keep up.  The problem is I think it has rather
gone out of fashion as an exercise format. Funnily enough I was looking on the
internet only last week to try and find a class that ran locally to me, but
there was nothing.  I think Zumba – a workout to dance music -is the new
craze, but I miss my entertaining combat classes and fellow classmates, those
were the days!

**Model Answer 2:**  
I used to ride a bicycle almost 2 hours per day in the evening when I was in
my college but for a long I do not do it. I had a racing cycle that I got from
my elder brother as a birthday gift and after that I decided to do cycling as
part of my exercise. It was 2012 and after 2013, I got busy with my study/
work and could not continue this form of exercise.

I can’t recall what was the exact reason I stopped riding the bicycle but as I
remember I stop doing it either I was sick for few days or because I had final
exams. Either way, after I stopped it, I had not been able to restart this
exercise. Definitely I would like to start this exercise as this is a very
effective exercise that keeps someone fit as well as refresh mentally. I am
planning to start this in few months and this time I would be in better hold
not to quit.

As I recall I had been in better health when I used to do this exercise. I
used to take my cycle and with friends used to ride the free roads beside the
hills and tea gardens. That was a great opportunity to spend time with
friends, roaming around the city and being close to nature. In my opinion that
was a great outdoor activity that kept both my body and mind fresh. I would
certainly  start this again in near future.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a way to relax that you find effective.

**You should say:**

  * what you do
  * where &amp; when you usually do this
  * who you usually do it with

**and explain why this is relaxing for you.**

**Model Answer:**  
Listening to my favourite music is very relaxing to me and I feel refreshed
and energetic with this activity. This is one of the most effective ways to
relax both mentally and physically and for me it has been proven to be a very
effective way of relaxation.

If I am at home, I listen to music either in my computer or in my music
player. I listen to music when I work or even when I take a nap. Sitting in
the balcony and listening to soft music is an out-of-the-world experience that
I often enjoy. When I am at work, I use my iPod to listen to my favourite
songs. Even in the public transportation, listening to music is relaxing.

I listen to music mostly alone but sometimes I listen to it with friends who
have similar taste of music. For that I use the speaker instead of the
headphone. Sometimes my niece comes to my room to listen to her favourite
music and I play her favourite music in my laptop. So in a sense I often do
that with her as well. But most of the time I enjoy music alone.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an outdoor meal or picnic that you had.

**You should say:**

  * Where did it take place
  * What was the occasion
  * What did you eat and drink there

**and explain whether you enjoyed it or not.**

**Model answer: **  
I can remember so many outdoor picnics with my friends and family members. In
fact we used to go outing and had our meals outside as part of the picnics
very frequently even few years back. One such picnic was a boat trip to a
nearby island called (say a name) where we went 3-4 years ago. It was a small
island and that island had some old buildings as well as a beautiful relaxing
spot surrounded by natures. The water around the island gives the impression
that you have come to an exotic land. We had our picnics in this island. There
was no particular occasion for the picnic; as far as I recall the community
people of our locality were planning for a picnic and they settled the day in
the mid-summer. On the day we had a big boat that took us to the island and we
spent the whole day there.  
  
I remember eating fried rice, roasted mutton, chicken, desert, different
cookies fruits and some other food items throughout the whole day during our
visit in the island. We drank plenty of waters as the weather was hot. We also
drank fruit juices and soft drinks in different times of the day.  
  
It was a great occasion for me. All of my family members and neighbors were
present in the picnic and that was a really relaxing occasion for me. I
enjoyed the boat journey and the picnic spot a lot. I played and chatted with
the neighboring kids and that was a very interesting and enjoyable gathering
in my opinion.

###  
Tips for Talking about this Cue card topic:

You can either talk about a picnic you had or a meal you took at outside of
home (outdoor meal specifically). For this particular cue card, talk about the
meal you remember having somewhere outside the house/ restaurant.  
  
Say that few days back you went to a family picnic at a place near the forest
and river and you had played outdoor games, you swam in the river and finally
you had your meal in the open field.  
  
First say where you had this picnic, give a brief description of this outdoor
picnic place and then say what the occasion was and who wet with you. Also
mention how reached the location and what things you saw and did there. For
the third question you need to mention the foods and drinks you had there and
for  the final part you need to tell whether you have enjoyed the picnic or
not. Give reasons for your liking and disliking.  
  
If you have described the place to be a nice one and if you have mentioned
that the activities you did and things you saw there gave you pleasure, you
should summarize that you really enjoyed the picnic. If you plan to say that
you did not enjoy the picnic and the vacation, start from the beginning that
you did not like the idea of going there and you did not like the place.  
  
This cue card asks you to talk about wither a picnic or an outdoor meal. Don’t
get confused with the idea of having street food with the outdoor meal.
Usually outdoor meal is synonymous to have a picnic. So describing a picnic
you had would put you in a strong position of your understanding of the cue
card.

  
**Similar Cue card topics:**  
  
**1.    Describe a vacation you recently had.  
2.    Describe a recreational place you know about.  
3.    Describing an outing with your friend.  
4.    Describe a meal you liked.

Whenever the time allows I would like to visit my grandparent’s house which is
at _(… say the place name…)_. After I left my hometown with my parents, I have
not visited my grandparent’s house for the last 4-5 years. The busy life and
tight exam have kelp me away for this much desired journey to take.

I would take a taxi to reach the rail station from my house. The train journey
will last for about 6 hours and after that I would require to take a public
bus to reach the station of my grandparent’s area. From there I would need to
walk for about half an hour and then cross the river in a boat. Then I would
finally need to pick a rickshaw to reach my grandparent’s house.

I would like to meet my grandpa at his home. Though he has visited our house
at town few times during this period, I still want to meet him, my uncles and
cousins there. I miss my hometown and being there is a great joy for me. I
passed my childhood at that place and want to go there as much as possible.

I have planned to go there during the summer vacation I will get from the
university. I have planned to save some money and take some amount from my
parents for this journey. I will take one of my best friends with me and would
show him the village where I was born. We will do lots of fun stuffs there and
would stay at around a week. We have planned to collect the train ticket
online and for the taxi, we will book it in advance. I am really looking
forward to enjoy this journey and my stay at my grandparent’s house.

you&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a time when someone helped you.

**You should say:**

  * Who helped you
  * When it was
  * Why s/he helped you

**And describe how you felt about it.**

**Model Answer:**  
In my life, I got numerous helps and advices and I am really grateful to the
Almighty for that. Among those, one of the important help I got was from one
of my teachers. The name of this teacher was _(...say a teacher’s name…)_ and
he helped me during my term final at my grade eight.

This final exam was very important in terms of getting admitted in a renowned
high school. I was very much eager to get a great grade to get admitted in the
most renowned high school of our town. My parents had great expectation as
well. I was probably 14 years old at that time and on the third day of my exam
I reached to the exam hall at around 8.45 am as I though the exam would start
at 9:00 am. But to my very worst surprise I noticed that the exam room was
already silent and everyone was busy writing in the answer sheets. I could not
relate to the reality with what was happening. Then I found that a teacher was
scolding me for being 1 and half hour late for the exam. I could not think
rationally and did not know what to do. I felt like I was just thrown down
from a mountain and I was falling with great speed without any hope of
surviving. At that moment I noticed Mr. _(…say the teacher’s name…)_ and he
tried to calm me. He assured me that everything would be fine. Then he asked
me the reason for being late. I told him the truth that I had the incorrect
timing in my exam schedule.

He then assured me and after taking permission from the principal, he arranged
me the full three hours of exam time. This was really unexpected for me and I
did well in the final exam. Because of the help I got from this teacher, I had
been able to secure A+ and got admitted in one of the best high schools in our
city. The reason he helped me is because he was a good man with a benevolent
heart, good will and honesty. He loved his students and simply helped me
because he knew that this exam was important to me.  
  
I felt overwhelmed and really grateful for what he did to me. The help was
unexpected and that saved me from a disaster. I felt very much happy and
grateful. I still feel grateful to this teacher and will always remember the
help I got from him that day.

sample%2F1180-ielts-cue-card-sample-268-describe-a-course-you-took-in-your-
college-or-university&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a course you took in your college or university.

**You should say:**

  * What it was
  * When you took it
  * What you learned from this course

**And explain why you took this course.**

**Model Answer:**  
‘Book Keeping &amp; Banking’ was one of the most interesting courses I took in
my university level and I thoroughly enjoyed this course. In fact I learned
many new concepts and theory from this course that it helped me a lot
throughout the remaining semesters. This was a mandatory course in the 3rd
semester in my Bachelor of Business Administration studies and the courses on
this subject lasted for four months. I was so interested in this course that
later on I took 3 other courses in different semesters related to banking.

I learned the accounting concept of banking, how a bank is operated, how the
banking transactions and accounting are maintained, how the central banks
control the money supply of the market and many more concepts from this
course. A practical session was included in this course and I learned some
basic transaction processes of bankers from this lab sessions.

In my third semester this was a mandatory course and I had no alternatives
other than taking this course. I came from Science background until my
undergraduate course and that’s why I had no prior accounting course
experience. I was bit dubious about this course in my university level as I
did not know what it includes. But after I completed this course, I found
myself very much interested in Banking procedure and automated banking.

###  Tips for answering this cue card:

For this cue card you can talk about any course (be it academic or not) you
took in your college or university. You should talk about a course that you
actually enjoyed so that you can answer the questions fluently. You are free
to pick any subject you like and the third question ‘what you learned from
this course’ actually expect you to talk about the things you learned from
this course.

For the final question ‘why you took this course’ might have two types of
answers; one: it was a mandatory subject and you had no other choice but to
enroll in it. Two: you had a passion and interest on this subject and that’s
why you decided to take it.

State the name of the academic subject clearly (like: C programming language,
Introduction to Business, Basic Accounting etc.). After that, tell the year
and term/ semester when you took this course. If you can recall the year and
month, also mention that.

**Your ability to talk about this cue card would also help you to talk about the following cue cards:**

**1.  Describe a subject taught in your school.  
2.  Describe one of your favourite subjects.  
3.  Describe something you learned from college.  
4.  Describe a subject taught in your university.  
5.  Talk about your favourite subject in high school.**

to-make-a-difficult-decision&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a friend of yours who had to make a difficult decision.

**You should say:**

  * What was the decision about?
  * Why did your friend have to decide?
  * What did your friend decide?

**And explain why you consider it as a difficult decision.**

**Model Answer:**  
My close friend Mark _(... or say name...)_ made a very tough decision and in
my opinion that was one of the most difficult decision I have ever seen
someone to decide. He had to decide whether the doctors should try to save his
wife's life or the yet-to-born baby's life. That day I was in the hospital and
I went to the consulting doctor's room with him. The doctors told that, the
mother's health condition was pretty severe and the baby would have a great
deal of complexity to be operated. Both the mother and baby's lives were in
danger and as the father and husband, Mark would have to decide what he wants.

Though that was a very tough call, my friend had to take prompt decision. I
noticed tears were dropping slowly from his both eyes. Finally he decided that
his wife's life should be given more priority that the yet-to-born baby.

There's no doubt that, it was a very tough decision to take. That was a life
and death situation for my friend's wife while much desired child was on the
other hand. Once the decision was taken, it could not be reveres and choosing
either wife's life or baby's life is definitely one of the hardest decisions
for a man. My friend must have gone through a hard time and stressful
experience to decide and the situation was very tough to handle. It was like
choosing an impossible thing but you have to choose. The wife was the life-
partner and his life-long companion while the baby was the dream,
representative of the next generation and a blessing for him. Letting go
either one is not an easy decision and my friend Mark had to decide something
very tough like this.

to-you&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a skill which is important to you.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * How difficult it is to learn
  * How can one learn it

**and explain why this is important to you.**

_[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]_

**Model Answer: **  
I’ll talk about driving which I think is the most important skill I’ve ever
learned. I guess the main reason as to why it’s so special is that it was a
long life passion for me to see myself at the wheel driving at a fast speed
and going where ever I fancied. What’s more, my father bought me a car when I
got my driving license which is a great gift to me, both financially and
sentimentally.

It is not a very difficult skill to learn but it requires some dedication,
practice and concentration to learn. One can learn it in 7 days with few hours
practice daily. But to become a really expert driver, someone needs to keep
driving regularly for about a year in my opinion.  
  
Someone interested to learn driving can contact to the local driving school
and can get enrolled with the quick driving lessons they have. Alternatively,
if someone has his/ her access to a car and can manage someone to teach
him/her the driving; s/he can do it as well.

###  Tips for answering this cue card topic:

Every positive skill is important to the person who has it as it helps him/her
doing things in a better way, getting things done quickly and establishing
him/her to be bit different than other ordinary people. For this cue card you
should be able to quickly think about a skill that you have. For people who
have some short of special skills can easily pick that and start talking about
it. But for people, who are not sure about their special skills, often get
confused what to talk about. Following are some of the ideas that you can talk
about to describe a skill you have:

  
1.  **Ability to swim:** This is a special skill that would be handy when you
need to journey on water road or work in a job which is related to water
traveling related.  
  
2.  **Electric work:** This is another important skill that often becomes very
helpful for people who can work on electronic devices.  
  
3.  **Ability to sing, draw or dance:** These three are kind of gifted skill
that helps people to entertain others and show their extra ordinary skills on
things that majority of people love.  
  
4.  **Communication Skill:** This is probably the most important skill for a
recognized professional life and the better the communication skill, the
better the career path. This communication skill also includes the ability of
presenting things, arguments, language skill etc.  
  
5.  **Writing Skill:** This is another type of communication skill but is done
through writing. This is also a very helpful skill for academic and
professional life.  
  
6.  **Technical skill:** Any short of technical skill that someone has is
considered to be helpful for career.  
  
7.  **Designing and Computer Skill:** Since computer, internet and designing
have become important skills for today’s job market, these skills are also
considered to be very important.  
  
8.  **Leadership skill: **This is also a very important skill for individual
who has it. This is also a proven skill for the high level professionals.  
  
9.  **Skills like cooking, sewing, fashion designing:** These are also good
skills and usually women have them more than men have them. These short of
skills are helpful for personal and professional life.  
  
10\. **Ability to drive different types of Vehicles: **This is also a skill
that can be very helpful in times of need.

  
Like the above list, you talk about anything that you consider as a skill and
would be comfortable to talk about. For the first question, give the details
of the skill you have and for the second questions, say that a skill can’t be
always learned like leadership, singing. Some of the skills are inherited and
over time with practice this gets even better. Some skills are strictly
dependent on the effort and practice, like computer skill, swimming skill etc.
None learn those skills from their genetics and though some are better than
others on those skills, practice is the mantra for those skills.  
  
For any skill you talk about, mention the hard work you have done to achieve
it or to fine tune it. Mention some of the extraordinary efforts you have put
to achieve it. Mention that with passions and practice this skill can be
learned though it is very difficult.  
  
Again for the third question “How can one learn it”, emphasize on the practice
and passion it requires to learn it. Describe some of the steps that someone
needs to go through to learn it. For the final question, why this skill is
important to you, mention that hours of works it has saved you, how people
appreciated you for this skill and also mention how this skill has made thing
easier for you in your personal, academic/ professional life.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What skill do you think the university has provided for your job?

Q. What skills can you learn in school?

Q. What do you think of the role of family for children to learn skills?

Q. What is the most popular skill that people want to learn?

Q. What kind of school would you send your children to? Why?

Q. What kind of skills have your parents learned?

Q. What are the advantages and disadvantages of school education and family
education?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a celebration when a number of guests came to your place.

**You should say:**

  * When it was
  * What you did
  * Who came

**and give details of the celebration.**

**Model Answer: **  
Thank you very much for the topic. There are many occasions that I remember
when people came to our houses and among them I would like to talk about my
younger sister’s birthday occasion when more than 50 guests came to our house.  
  
It was two years ago and I went to my home time three days before my sister’s
birthday to celebrate the occasion. It was mid January and I had some day offs
at that time. I planned to stay for a week there. Initially my thought was
that the birthday would be strictly a family celebration and no other guests
would be present. But after I reach home, I learned that many people have been
invited and my family is arranging a big party for the birthday occasion.  
  
I went to shop to buy a gift for my sister as well as any last moment shopping
needed for the party. I also bought some fancy items to decorate the house and
bought a new dress for my sister. I helped my father on some of the pending
tasks regarding the party and went to invite 3-4 of my friends. On the
celebration day, I greeted many guests, made sure that they have been offered
relaxing places to sit and talked to many of them. When my sister cut the
birthday cake, I took lots of photos and finally helped my family members to
take care of the guests.  
  
More than 50 people came to the party including some of our relatives,
neighbours, my sister’s friends and 2-3 of my friends. Amazingly I found some
of the relatives who I have not met for a long.  
  
The feast for the birthday celebration was in the evening and guests was
supposed to have dinner at our home. The guest started coming from the early
evening and we greeted them. After 1 hour or so, my sister cut the cake and we
enjoyed a light food then. The guests enjoyed their stay and some of them
gossiped, some of them watched TV and many of them were sitting in different
places of our house. At the dinner time, we served the dinner to the guests.
The social gathering was the most important part of the party and people
seemed like enjoyed each other’s company. At around 9:00 pm people started
leaving our home and once again we greeted then and thanked for their time and
lively participation.

###  Tips for answering this Cue Card topic:

For this Cue card you can talk about any occasion when a number of people
(guests) came to your house to participate the celebration. It can be a
birthday celebration of any of your family member, a party thrown by you or
your parents, a religious festival, a social gathering for a new born. Since
the cue card is about a celebration when the guests came to your place, avoid
circumstances like funeral, social visit to see a sick member of family as
these are not considered as the celebration.  
  
First say the occasion and if this is not a very common occasion like birthday
party, give some details of it. Then say when it was, why this celebration was
held, where it was celebrated, your idea of the celebration and say your part
on the arrangement of the celebration. After that give details of the guests
who came at the celebration. Mention in brief what they do, how you greeted
them, what was their observation of the celebration etc.  
  
Finally you need to give details of the celebration and in this part you can
give the details of the celebration from a different perspective than the
things you have already said. For instance, in this part you can mention why
your family planned to celebrate it, how you selected the guests, what type of
invitation you sent, and a brief detail of the whole celebration.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your favourite actor.

**You should say:**

  * Who is he
  * What type of actor he is
  * What are some programs/ movies he acted in

**And describe why he is your favourite actor.**

**Model Answer:**  
Brad Pitt is one of my very favourite actors and I am a huge fan of his
movies. He is a famous Hollywood actor and has got several prizes for his
superb work in movies.

Honestly he is a good actor who is known world-wide. He is the husband of
another famous female actress Angelina Jolie. His full name is William Bradley
"Brad" Pitt and he is around 50 years old now. For his excellent performance
in acting he has received a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award,
and three Academy Award nominations in acting categories. He has done some
film production works as well. He is a fine actor with a natural gift of
depicting the characters. Often his performance in movies gets very high
applauses and because of that he was nominated for Oscars more than once.

He usually acts in drama and action movies but his acting varies from the
character of a vampire to a war hero and legendary characters as well. I have
enjoyed most of the movies acted by him and his performance in movies like
Seven, Interview with the vampire, The legend of the falls, 7 years in Tibet,
Meet Joe Black was simply excellent. I find him to be a very high class actor
and a superb person with his tremendous activity in social welfare works. All
these reasons make him to my favourite actor.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe how you met your best friend.

**You should say:**

  * Who is s/he
  * How &amp; where you two met
  * What things you did together

**and give details on how you two met.**

**Model Answer:**  
I met my best Friend Raz when I was only 10 years old and that was in a family
program which was short of a small birthday celebration. His full name is
Abraham Raz and he is still my best friend after so many years.

It was his younger sister’s 5th birthday and our whole family was invited to
attend the celebration. We went their home in the evening and stayed there
till late night. I found a boy around my age was present at the party and was
looking at me quite often. All of a sudden he came to me and asked if my name.
I found that he was in grade 4 and was quite good at Math and History. He
offered me to play the chess with him and he also showed me his book and stamp
collections. This is how I met my best friend at his sister’s birthday party
and with time our friendship and intimacy grew stronger.

We often played football, chess and other games together. Since we studied in
the same high school, we did countless things together including wandering in
old houses &amp; forest, fishing, making toys and gaming tools, watching games
and movies, sharing foods, studying and even fighting together. We had many
common interests and hobbies like collecting stamps, visiting places, swimming
in the river, playing football, and drawing. We often did these activities
together and in fact we enjoyed doing so.

Still we debate on our personal issues, challenge each other on games, discuss
politics, history, current issues etc. We actually enjoy our time together. He
is a very good friend of mine and he has helped me in times of needs. Our
mutual understanding is pretty deep and that’s why we are best friends.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a recent change in your life.

**You should say:**

  * what was it
  * what was the reason for this change
  * was it a positive or negative change for you

**and explain what happened after this change.**

**Model Answer:**  
I have completed my graduation only few months ago and within the three months
of my departure from the university, I started working in a private company.
My new job and my life-style changes due to that job is very recent and in my
opinion pretty significant as well.

Since I joined this company as a Business Executive, I had to make a shift
from my student life to corporate life. That was the main reason for the
changes I went through.  
Definitely that was an important and positive change for my life. I had to
join a company or organization to start my career and I was very glad that I
was appointed by a big and prestigious company of the country.

I am no longer a student and I do not have to attend classes and prepare for
exams. I am now responsible for the job position I have. Many things have
changed including my sleeping pattern and dress-up. I now sleep early and wake
up early which were pretty opposite during my student life. I have to maintain
office time and follow up my job responsibilities that I was trusted with
during my appointment. In fact I am happy with the changes in my life. I have
a great vision and big ambition about my career and now I feel that I am on
the right track and I will have to work hard to achieve my future goal. All of
those realizations came in my mind after I started working for this company.
Besides, now I enjoy economic freedom and that’s a major change as well.

would-like-to-take-up&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a new sport or hobby you would like to take up.

**You should say:**

  * what is it
  * how would you start it
  * why you have not started it yet

**and explain why you want to start it.**

**Model Answer:**  
If I get the chance and nothing unusual happens, I would like to start playing
basketball soon. This is a sport that fascinates me a lot and after 4-5 months
when I will finish my graduation, I will start playing this game on a regular
basis. In fact some of my neighbours already play this game every evening in a
nearby basketball playground and all I have to do is start playing with them.

They are very close to me and they’ll definitely welcome me to join their
team. I will need to buy a pair of sports trousers and shoes and spend some
money to start playing it. Actuality the expense is very low and that wouldn’t
be a problem for me to start the activity.

Though I often watched this game on television or in our local play-ground, I
never played it myself. May be I was bit anxious about the performance or
skill of mine in this game and that’s why I have not started it yet. I planned
to start playing it when I was in grade 9, but because my family had to move
to a new city, I could not start it.

This is a game that fascinates me and since I often watch it on television, I
have a great passion about it. Two of my previous attempts to start playing
this game were ruined and I feel somehow that has enhanced my interest about
this game even more. I need to shape my body and I found it would be a great
game to do so. That’s the most important reason I want to start it as soon as
possible.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. Why do you think some people like doing new things?**

**Q. What problems can people have when they try new activities for the first time?**

**Q. Do you think it’s best to do new things on your own or with other people? Why?**

**Q. What kinds of things do children learn to do when they are very young? How important are these things?**

**Q. Do you think children and adults learn to do new things in the same way? How is their learning style different?**

**Q. Some people say that it is more important to be able to learn new things now than it was in the past. Do you agree or disagree with that? Why?**

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an event that changed your life for the better.

**You should say:**

  * what was the event
  * what happened
  * when it happened

**and explain how it changed your life for better.**

**Model Answer:**  
In our lives, we learn everyday knowingly or unknowingly. What we do now
shapes our future and every event has its importance and consequence in our
life. Yet there are some major and significant events that change our path
dramatically. One such important event in my life was helping a neighbour when
he got ill severely all of a sudden. I was passing the neighbor’s house and I
heard a noise that sounded more like a scream. In fact the person got a heart
attack and I was only 12 years old at that time to understand that clearly. I
ran to his house and when I noticed him lying in the ground, I shouted for
help. I called my parents and one of my cousins and we took him to the
hospital promptly. The doctor went through the medical treatment and tests and
thanked us for being so prompt. The consulting doctor also mentioned that,
something bad could have happened if we have waited a bit long to take him to
the hospital.

This person became very grateful to us and also became a family friend. He
became a friend, guardian and teacher to me. He often helped me on my studies
and taught me many valuable and moral aspects of life.

After I passed my A level, I was accepted by a prestigious Medical College of
our country and my father tried to manage a bank loan to support my
educational expenses. But he was undone. He had not been able to manage the
large amount needed for me to get myself admitted in this Medical College.
This neighbour who became our family friend raised his benevolent support and
sold one of his properties to support my education. We tried to protest by all
means but he was determined to help. Over the period, my father and I repaid
his money but what he did was beyond repayable.

Because of him, I am a doctor now. That all happened because of the event when
I was 12. That event changed the path of my life. This event changed my life
for something better and greater.

people&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a neighbor who helps other people.

**You should say:**

  * Who is s/he
  * How you know him/ her
  * How often you meet

**and explain how this neighbor helps other.**

**Model Answer:**  
I live in a metropolitan city where people mostly lead a busy life. We do not
know all the neighbours in our locality and yet I am lucky to have many nice
neighbours for their amiable behaviours, sense of responsibilities and
benevolent mentality. Among them Mr. Kruse _(…or say a name you like…)_ is a
person who frequently extends his helping hand for others. He is a doctor and
in fact a very famous one. He is a devoted doctor who often helps people with
his service and he has a good reputation as a good and kind doctor. I have
noticed many times that he does not impose a fixed fee for the poor patients.

He has been living in our community for the last 5-6 years and I often meet
him in the evening while we both get out for a stroll in the nearby park. I
visited his chamber for professional advice regarding the health issue I had
and took my family members to him as well. To my surprise he gave an utmost
importance to our issues, unlike other doctors we have seen, and prescribed
some really helpful therapy and medicines.

Usually the doctors in our city has a tendency to charge a large amount of
money to the visiting patients and do not care for the paying capability of
the poor patients. But Mr. Kruse is an exception to that. With his
professional skill and reputation he could have amassed a fortune for him and
for his family but because of his benevolent and kind nature, he is still
leading a mediocre but happy life. From my conversation with him, I realized
that he puts more priority in helping others than earning money.

He sometimes even sacrifice his own conform and family needs to visit a
patient who can’t come to his chamber. Thus he has sought to help others and
that’s a great virtue we do not see very often. In my opinion he is the most
helpful neighbour I have ever had.

###  Part 3: Details Discussion:

**Q. What are some of the ways people can help others in the community? Which one is most important?**

**Q. Why do you think some people like to help other people?**

**Q. Some people say that people help others in the community more now than they did in the past. Do you agree or disagree? Why?**

**Q. What types of services, such as libraries or health centres, are available to the people who live in your area? Do you think there are enough of them?**

**Q. Which groups of people generally need most support in a community? Why?**

**Q. Who do you think should pay for the services that are available to the people in a community? Should it be the government or individual people?**

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an historical figure who you know about.

**You should say:**

  * Who is s/he
  * How s/he is famous
  * Where &amp; when s/he lived

**and explain his/ her contribution to the world.**

**Model Answer:**  
Leonardo da Vinci is one of the most significant persons in world history and
he is often considered as the most diversely talented person ever to have
lived in human history. His full name was ‘Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci’ and
lived from 1452 – 1519 mainly in Italy. He had an incomparable talent and he
excelled as a painter, engineer, mathematician, architect, geologist, writer,
cartographer, inventor, botanist, sculptor, anatomist, and musician.

He probably would have been a famous person in history only because of his
perfection and talent in art, let along the other talents he had. He was a
genus and a second to none figure of Renaissance humanist ideal. The talent,
curiosity and logic he presented at his time of living were simply superhuman.
His famous painting includes Mona Lisa, The Last Supper, Vitruvian Man, The
Creation of Adam and the world now revere these works as the greatest art
works of all time. In many art colleges and institutes, his works are
considered to be the model works and grammar for fine work on art. His arts,
paintings and notebooks compose a contribution to later generations of
artists.

He is also esteemed for his ingenuity in technology and many of his ideas
inspired some later invention in the field of science and engineering. His
contribution in technology includes the conceptualization and experiments in
solar power, flying machines, armoured vehicles, calculating machine etc. He
was a high class inventor and visionary of science. His other inventions like
bobbing winder, optics and hydrodynamics were well ahead of his time. He has
great contribution in anatomy, civil engineering and optics as well.   It
would require a large volume of books to list down his contributions and
talents. He would be revered throughout the history and in my opinion he is
one of most influential and famous historical figure the world has ever seen.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an exciting news that you heard (either through the phone or
e-mail).

**You should say:**

  * What is was about
  * Who gave this news
  * When you got this news

**and explain why this was an exciting news to you.**

**Model Answer:**  
The exciting news that I heard over phone was the birth news of my nephew. My
mother called me on my cell phone when I was away from my home-town and that’s
one of the most exciting news I have ever got in my life.

I was in the second year in my university and because of that I was away from
home. One day my mother called and gave me this happy news. I had exam ahead
of me and after getting the news I was so happy and thrilled that I forgot
everything and came to my hometown at that very night to see the newborn baby.
I have two sisters and I am the youngest son of my parents. My sisters got
married and first when I was in my A level. I heard that my sister was
pregnant and would have a baby soon.

Having a baby at our home was a much desired dream of ours and I often
fantasized to have a beautiful baby at our home. So we were counting days for
the baby to come to this world and for enlighten our house. At the last moment
of my sister’s pregnancy, she became very ill and some complexities appeared
as the doctors reported. Naturally we were very anxious for the mother and the
baby who is yet to come. When I got the call from my mom that my sister has
become the mother of a beautiful baby and both are fine, I was in one hand
very animated and on the other hand relieved from the tension that I was going
through for the last few days.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a long distance journey you have been on.

**You should say:**

  * When you took this journey
  * Where you went
  * What kind of transportation you used

**and explain what happened in this journey.**

**Model Answer:**  
I visited India 2/3 years back and at that time I took a journey from Kolkata
to New Delhi and then back to Kolkata on the next day. This was indeed a very
long journey compared to the usual journey I have had. It was probably March,
2012 when I went to India to meet a colleague. I went to Kolkata to meet him
and then an emergency appeared to get back to my embassy in New Delhi.

From the Kolkata train station I booked a seat in an express train and started
my journey alone. It took me more than 26 hours to reach New Delhi train
station and after finishing my task at the embassy I took a train again to get
back to Kolkata.

The main transportation I used was express train and apart from that I had to
take taxi and local tram during this journey. After I took my seat in the
train I started reading a book I had with me. After few hours I went to the
lunch boggy to have my lunch and there I met a person from my country. He was
a photo journalist and we had a long conversation. I slept in the train at
night and listened to the music in my iPad. I bought some local English
magazines ad read interesting stuffs. In the next morning I reached New Delhi
station and from there I went to my embassy. I finished my tasks there and get
back to another train to Kolkata. On my way back, I watched the villages and
people the train was passing and took many photos that I instantly updated in
my blog. Apart from the long hour’s journey and being alone in the whole
journey, I enjoyed the trip.

have-met-recently&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an interesting person you have met recently.

**You should say:**

  * Who is s/he
  * What s/he does
  * How you met him/ her

**and explain why s/he is interesting.**

**Model Answer:**  
Mr. Robert Neil _(..or say a name you like...)_ is an interesting person whom
I met few months ago. He lives a few blocks away from our home and has
recently moved to our locality from a different city. He has a family with 4
members and he is an engineer graduate and has worked as a chief engineer in
many reputed organizations as he told me. In his early 40’s he took self-
retirement and now enjoys his time either in developing some mysterious
engineering and scientific tools or by travelling to different places of the
world.

It’s pretty tough to say whether he is planning to visit a new country or has
recently came from one if someone meets him. He mostly wears outdated clothes
and has long beard with a strange look in his eyes. To my surprise, I found my
conversation with him very interesting as he likes to talk about his plan to
invent something very important to change the world. I am not sure what he is
up to but it seems very thought-provoking to learn that he really believes
that. He travels to hills and forests mostly to stay close to nature as he
describes this habit to be helpful for idea generation. People often look at
him very strangely and do some small talks about his attitude but I find him
to be an interesting person. To my surprise he is a very devoted and dotting
father and husband and has a good flow of money even though he does not have a
full time job now.

I met him all of a sudden and that was interesting as well. One day he knocked
at my door and I opened it. He came to our house and asked whether I can give
him some copper or not. I was pretty perplexed with his sudden appearance and
demand for the copper. He told me that he was doing an important experiment
and he needs this to carry out his test. I apologized that we do not have any
copper to offer him and advised him to visit the nearby shopping complex where
he might find it. He returned back after an hour with some bags and thanked me
to let him know where he might find the copper he was looking for. He then
offered to visit his house and have dinner with him. The whole confrontation
took me by surprise and I understood from that very day that he was bit
unusual and interesting in nature.

sample%2F1254-ielts-cue-card-sample-299-describe-an-idea-you-have-for-
improving-something-at-work-or-college&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an idea you have for improving something at work or college.

**You should say:**

  * What is it about
  * Where you got this idea
  * How difficult it would be to implement

**and explain why you think this would improve the work place or college.**

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Model Answer:**  
Since I am student and have never worked for a company, my idea is related to
the college where I study. Engaging two teaching assistants for each class is
an idea that would very positively improve the study environment and facility
in our college/ university. It is a large college with more than seven
thousand students. Each class has more than 40 students and not all of them
are equally talented and focused to the lessons. So if the college authority
arranges to enroll two promising and talented students who have the capability
to manage the classes and assist the teachers to explain lessons to other
students, would be a great aid for all the students who often struggle to
understand the lessons but do not ask questions to the teachers. In fact that
would be a great initiative by the college administration to help all the
students with their lessons. I got the idea from a website of a renowned
university that explained how they enroll teaching assistants and this process
helps all the students of a class.

I do not think it would be very difficult to implement. The college authority
needs to discuss this whole idea and then finally decide the process. That
might require some administrative and decision level meeting. The extra budget
that would be required would not be a big hassle for the college to support.
So in my opinion I do not see any major obstacles to implement this idea.

From my experience I can say that only one-third of the whole students in a
class can catch and fully understand the lectures delivered by the teachers.
The remaining two-third students of a class neither understand the lessons nor
ask questions to the teachers to explain things again. Many students do not
ask the questions they have directly to the teachers and thus always remain as
the back-benchers. If they get teaching assistants from their classmates, they
would surely raise their questions to those TA and would be greatly
benefitted. The overall study quality would improve and the results of the
college would also improve dramatically.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion/ Detail discussion:

**_Ideas and Education:_**

Q. Some people think that education should be about memorizing the important
ideas of the past. Do you agree or disagree? Why?

Q. Should education encourage students to develop and share their own ideas?

Q. How do you think teachers could help students to develop and share their
own ideas?

**_Ideas in the workplace:_**

Q. Should employers encourage their workers to have new ideas about improving
the company? Why?

Q. Do you think people sometimes dislike ideas just because they are new? Why?

Q. What is more difficult: having new ideas or putting them into practice?
Which is more important for a successful company?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a family photograph you remember.

**You should say:**

  * When it was taken
  * who were in the picture
  * when it was taken

**and explain why you remember this family photograph.**

**Model Answer:**  
The family photograph that I really like and remember well is the one which
was taken almost 20 years ago. This photograph was framed and enlarged by my
father and it is still hanging on the wall of our drawing room. This
photograph was taken when I was only 3 years old and at the 6th marriage
anniversary of my parents.

My father, mother and I were standing in while my grandparents were sitting in
front of us in this picture. The picture captured the memory of a very happy
family. The time when this picture was taken, I was very little then and I
don’t have any particular memory of this event. Back then camera was very rare
in our country and I heard from my mother that a camera man was hired to take
the photo of this event. The picture was taken in the garden of our house and
my grandparents used to live with us at that moment.

My grandparents have passed away and this is a revered memory of them. I still
look at this picture and feel sad not to have them with us now. I was very
little and I still look at me in this photograph with bewilderment. This is
the picture that gives me the memory of a happy event, happy family, and
innocent me. As I notice this photograph very often at my home, I remember it
very well. This is in fact the only picture I have of my pre-school age. So
this is very important and memorable for me.

##  Describe a place where your parents took you to.

**You should say:**

  * Where your parents took you
  * How old you were then
  * How you went there

**and explain whether you enjoyed it or not.**

**Model Answer:**  
When I was 17 years old, my parents took me to a relative’s house and I
learned that this was a particular relative who saved my life when I was only
6. Since I was deeply touched by the event and the person, I still remember
this event and my time there. It was in _(…say a place in…)_, a nearby village
of my grandparents’ house that I never knew about. One day my parents asked me
to go visit a relative’s house when we were in my grandparent’s house. I went
with them and on our journey we took a local bus and finally a boat to reach
the place. To my surprise I was standing in front of an old house and my
parents took me inside the house where I saw a very old woman. She was almost
70 years old and was lying in her bed. My mother introduced me to her and told
me a story that I will never forget.

She told me that, one day I went to swim in a pond with one of my cousins when
I was around 6 years old without informing anyone of my family. They were busy
on other tasks and that’s why did not notice two of us silently escaped from
home and went to that pond to swim though we did not know how to swim at that
early age. There we were slipped from the sloppy corner of the pond and
directly fall in the deep water. According to my mother’s story, no one was
around except an old woman who noticed us struggling in the water and she
risked her life to save two of us.

In fact my parents took me to meet that particular woman who was counting her
days. That was such a touchy story that I could not retrain my tears at that
age. I looked at the soft eyes of that old woman and felt like I was looking
at my survivor. Later on I heard that, my father raised his helping hand to
this particular woman for many years and showed his gratitude towards her.

My parents took me many places in my childhood and adolescence time but to me
that was the most mysterious and touchy place I have been with them.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about an important day in your life.

**You should say:**

  * When was it
  * What happened in this day
  * Was it a positive or negative day for you

**and explain why this was in important day for you.**

**Model Answer:**  
My first day at my university is an important day for me. That was so much
enchanting and inspiring for me that, it became one of my most memorable
events in my life. I consider this day to be a very important day in my life
because of its significance to shape my future.

I got admitted in an Engineering University of my country where mostly rich
people send their kids for study. I was enrolled in this university because of
my academic record and being one of the merit listed students. It was 2006 and
I went to my university on 12th January. I noticed that most of the students
were dropped by their parents and I was very few of the students who had to
take a shared bus to reach the university campus.

I went to stroll around the campus as it was the orientation day and no
classes were scheduled for that day. All of a sudden I found myself talking to
me and I was taking some oaths myself. One of those oaths was that, study
would be the top most priority for the next 5 years of my life. I was also
determined that I would not get involved in kind of politics and riot groups
and would solely focus to make an impressive academic records. I visited the
library, labs, classrooms, auditoriums and all those massive and beautiful
constructions and facilities inspired me a lot. In fact his was the day when
the realization hit me that I have a good opportunity ahead of me and I have
to devote myself to grab this opportunity as much as possible. In terms of the
significant determination I gathered that day, it was in fact a very positive
day for me. Very few moments and events stirred me so much to take this short
of self-vow and oaths to change the future.

##  Describe a children's park you have visited recently.

**You should say:**

  * When you went there
  * Who was with you
  * What you did there

**and explain why you went to visit this children's park.**

**Model Answer:**  
Last month I visited a children’s park in our area with my 8 years old nephew.
He was getting bored at home and his mother requested me to take him outside
and I took him to the nearby children’s park. It was in the evening and there
were lots of other children who came there with their parents. I found that my
nephew Smith was very happy to be in this park and he enjoyed the activities
offered there for children. He rode on many rides and ran for a long until he
got tired.

I went there after a very long time and enjoyed the children’s activity as
they were playing, shouting and joyfully running in the park. There were many
trees and flowers in this park and I was mostly watching my nephew or the
other children.

At a time I found that John had already made two / three playmates and them
all came to me and asked me to take a picture. I took few photos of those
angelic kids and bought them some nuts and ice-creams. When the darkness
started falling around us, I asked my nephew to get back home and we started
walking towards home. Both of us enjoyed our sudden visit to that children’s
park though one of us one not a child at all!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a good neighbour of yours.

**You should say:**

  * who is s/he
  * how long s/he is your neighbour
  * what sort of person s/he is

**and explain why you think him/her to be a good neighbour.**

**Model Answer:**  
I live in a beautiful and peaceful are and most of my neighbours are kind,
benevolent and well-mannered. Among them I would pick Mr. Patrick as a very
good neighbour I have. He is an Engineer and works for a large engineering and
manufacturing company. He is married and has four children.

He lives with his family only three blocks away from our house. He moved in
our community 5-6 years ago and in this sense he is my neighbour for the last
5-6 years.  
He is very amiable and talented person. He speaks very kindly with everybody
and with children and senior citizen he behaves very mildly no matter what. I
have seen his research papers been published in a reputed science and
engineering journal and he is a renowned engineer in our town. In his career
life, he is a successful Engineer and in his personal life he is a good human,
dotting father and caring husband. He obeys the rules and regulation of our
community very strictly and because of that, everyone in our community likes
him.

I like him very much because of his kind and benevolent attitude and cordial
behavior. He helps poor people and also boldly protests any discrimination and
injustice he notices. His talent, fame and successful career have not made him
a proud person. Rather he has become a kind and good hearted man over time. In
our community, most of the people like him and he is in my opinion a neighbour
anyone would expect to have.

##  Describe your favorite part of the day.

**You should say:**

  * when it is
  * what you do then
  * how long this part of a day lasts

**and explain why this is your favorite part of the day.**

**Model Answer:**  
Early morning is my most favourite part of the day. Though I do not get up
early every day, I love the morning time from 5:30 am to 8:30 am.

I often wash myself and take a light breakfast at around 6:00 am and then go
out for a walk. I usually go to a park and enjoy the fresh air. The
environment seems very serene and clean at that time. I often sat beside a
lake and enjoy the fishes and birds there. The part of the day I am talking
about lasts around 3 hours. When the clock ticks 8:30am, people start hurrying
for the office, school and business places. A lot of cars start moving by that
time and the roads become busy and noisy.

The serenity, freshness and peacefulness that the early morning offers are
really charming and exceptional. This is the starting of a new day with new
promises and possibilities. I enjoy the sparkle and freshness of the morning
and also love the birds, fishes, gardens. To me this is the most beautiful
part of the day. Other parts of a day have their own attractions and beauty
but to me the early morning time is the best and most stunning among them all.

##  Describe a song that has a special meaning to you.

**You should say:**

  * what is it about
  * who is the singer of this song
  * when you first heard it

**and explain why this song has a special meaning to you.**

**Model Answer:**  
The song ‘Return to Innocence’ by music band ‘Enigma’ is one of my all time
favourite songs and this song bears a special meaning to me. This song is
about the human life: the beginning and ending of our lives, the meaning of
life, the aim and journey to eternity, and the vision of our life. It
signifies the importance of life and how much we should cherish our life.
Finally, it is about our journey to another life and life transformation in
different stages.

As I mentioned earlier this is a song by famous music band ‘Enigma’ and this
band is particularly famous of the extraordinary music they produce. I heard
this song many years back when I was in my 9th grade. In my birthday one of
our relatives gave me a CD of ‘Enigma’ band and then I heard this song. I
liked most of the songs of this album but this particular song ‘Return to
Innocence’ was bit different and I liked it instantly I heard it for the first
time. After that I heard this song several hundred times and still this music
appears as a new inspiration to me. I believe this would never turn into a
lost song for me.

The brilliant lyrics and extraordinary music of this song soothe my heart each
time I listen to it. I can feel this music with every sense of mine and that’s
an out-of-the-world feelings. I have found the lyrics pretty rich and
meaningful that gave me special meaning about the life we lead. In my
stressful and tiresome time this pretty rich and meaningful that gave me
special meaning about the life we lead. In my stressful and tiresome time this
particular song has inspired and motivated me many times. This song has become
a memory of me. Whenever I listen to this song, I feel a special sensation and
that’s why this has a special meaning and strong significance to me.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about one of your birthdays you remember well.

**You should say:**

  * How old you were
  * How you celebrated this birthday
  * What you did

**and explain why you remember this birthday so well.**

**Model Answer:**  
I have recently turned to 25 and last year my family and friends arranged a
birthday that became a remarkable day for me and I will always remember this
birthday. It was my 24th birthday and I was in the final year of my
University. I had approaching exam and had no plan to visit my hometown and
celebrate my birthday. But my friends planned to surprise me on my birthday
and also asked my parents and siblings to join them on that day.

I went outside at around 9 pm. And returned after an hour and noticed that my
parents and siblings have come to the house I stay with my friends and
classmates. I knew that my family members came to celebrate my birthday. I was
bit confused as I had no preparation for that and I felt bit lost about the
whole event.

When the clock ticked to 12.01 am, my friends started unfurling their
surprises for me and that included a four storied cake, numerous gifts and
music festival. I enjoyed this birthday occasion thoroughly and to my surprise
my friends invited some of their cousins as well.

I was mostly speechless and continuously thanked my friends for the great
preparation they did for my birthday celebration. I spent the night with my
friends, we watched a movie at late night and finally I went to sleep in the
early morning.

This is a very surprise party for me and the friends I was talking about took
a great burden to arrange everything to celebrate this occasion. They even
invited my parents and siblings so that they can also be the part of the whole
celebration. It was quite a different birthday celebration for me and I
remember it very well. The gifts that I got on that were very expensive
including Kindle Fire, iPod, Gymnasium instrument and many other gifts. I was
very much touched by the whole event and it took me by surprise. That is why
this has become a part of my memory and I can recall the whole event very
clearly.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something you often do when you are not working or studying.

**You should say:**

  * what you do
  * where you do it
  * who you do it with

**and explain why you do it.**

**Model Answer:**  
I often browse the social networking website Facebook and write for my blog
when I do not have studies, approaching exams or other important tasks. I use
Facebook to update my status, to share the news or photos, to know the updates
of my friends, to chat with them and to be on a platform where most of my
friends and relatives are connected.  
I also have a technology &amp; hobby related blog where I write blog-posts,
answer questions asked by visitors and moderate the guest blogging. I usually
do it in my laptop or in my desktop computer. I sometimes use my Facebook
account from my mobile phone. But for the blog writing and moderation, I rely
on my desktop computer.

I have two friends who help me updating my blog. They often give me blog-post
idea and help me on some tech-websites references as well. They do it from
their homes and they communicate me either in computer chatting or in my
mobile phone. For Facebook surfing I absolutely maintain my website all alone
as it is personal account. But in Facebook, I have lots of friends, relatives
and classmates who correspond me online.

I find Facebook to be the most widely used social networking platform and most
of my friends, old classmates, and relatives are connected with me. For me
this is the place where I can get updates of all of my friends and people who
I care about. In terms of communications and update sharing, Facebook is the
best platform and that’s why I use it.  
Besides, my blog is an important place for me to write technological and hobby
related information. A blog that has a good number of visitors per day is a
great resource for anyone. For me, this is the place to share my knowledge,
and for that I need to read a lot which is very helpful in our professional
and personal life. For all these beneficial aspects and the passion I have, I
do it often.

would-like-to-try&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a foreign food that you would like to try.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * how you learned about this food
  * where it is mostly taken

**and explain why you want to try this foreign food.**

**Model Answer 1:**  
There is a foreign food that I would really like to try, but I wonder if my
choice will surprise you?  I will tell you what it is, how I learned about it,
where it is mostly eaten and explain why I want to taste it so badly.

The food is…. Pizza!  Now of course this is a food that you can buy all over
the world, and I really enjoy the pizza that I can buy in my home country
which is England in the UK.  However, I recently learned from a friend that
the style of pizza available here is nothing like the authentic Italian pizza
you can get if you visit its country of origin, and since then, it’s one of
the things on my bucket list.  That is, something I’d like to do before I die
is to travel to Italy, find a local pizzeria and get a really authentic pizza.

So how did I learn what I’ve been missing?  I shop regularly at a local family
owned delicatessen.  The proprietor is Italian, and he is a great foody – that
is he takes food very seriously, sourcing only the best ingredients. He and
his wife are both vegetarian like me, so they often suggest food or recipes.
The other day we were talking and he was bemoaning the lack of ‘proper’ pizzas
in this country.  He told me that whilst of course, Italian food is very
regional including its pizzas, they are nevertheless distinctive.  All pizzas
MUST be cooked in a wood-fired oven for a start, the dough should be tossed by
hand.  The pizza should only be made with the very freshest and finest
ingredients, and is best eaten outdoors too, of course, against the backdrop
of the Italian countryside!

Pizza is eaten everywhere in Italy, though of course approximations of pizza
can be bought the world over.  Even so, my deli friend has persuaded me I’ve
been missing out, and I’d like to find out for myself how different it might
taste if I go for an authentic recipe, venue and location.  I’ve never had a
real pizza, and I’ve never been to Italy either, I think it would be a winning
combination – not to mention that it would also be a great excuse to go to a
beautiful country that I have yet to visit.  What do you think, would you like
to come too?

[ Written by - **Lucy Marris **|  Careers Adviser (UK), TEFL teacher (Vietnam)
]

**Model Answer 2:**  
I would like to try the Salmon fish with onion and olive oil which is a
foreign menu for the people of our country. In our country we do not have the
Salmon fish and the finest quality olive oil is imported from Italy. The
exotic menu I have mentioned is available only in a five star hotel in our
country. If I get the opportunity someday, I will try this food item.

I learned about this item from a lifestyle &amp; travel related TV channel few
years ago. I was randomly checking the programs of different channels and I
noticed this TV channel. The cook described in details how to prepare this
food items, what ingredients would be required, how to make it tastier and I
watched it all with utmost interest and attention. Few years later I found
this menu in a billboard beside a big hotel in our city and at that time I
planned to have it. Since it is a foreign food item and available only in this
luxurious and expensive hotel, it would be quite expensive for me.

After watching the TV program on cooking, I got interested about this food.
Apart from that, I heard that Salmon fish is a very tasty food. The way the TV
program presented it was very impressive and extraordinary. This program and
their way of cooking grabbed my interest and attention. I would like to taste
it mostly because I watched it in a TV program and heard that this is a menu
worth trying.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a radio program that you listened recently.

**You should say:**

  * What was it about
  * When you where you listened to it
  * How was it presented

And explain if it was interesting or not.

**Model Answer:**

I usually listen to radio while I drive my car and the traffic update and
hourly news programs are very useful in my opinion during driving. The traffic
update program "Busy Hours" is one such program that I recently listened to.
This program is hosted by two renowned radio jockeys and the program gives
latest traffic conditions of the main roads of our city. I listened to week
last week when I was driving back to home from my uncle's house. It was around
6:30 pm and I was in the Capocity Street at that time.

The host of the program started it and then talked to their news collectors
from various places and they were updating the traffic conditions. In my
opinion the host and the news collectors did really well in terms of giving
the traffic updates of the road. They were even saying humorous things to
entertain the listeners.

To me this is a very handy and interesting program that I listen to. This
radio program broadcasts the live traffic conditions of the various roads and
highways and thus informs the people which roads to avoid and which roads to
take. I find this information very helpful while driving in the roads. The
concept of the program and the presentation of this program are very handy and
interesting in my opinion.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a quality you really admire.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * how this quality helps
  * how difficult it is to acquire

And explain why you admire this quality.

**Model Answer:**  
Honesty is the quality I admire most and I believe that, honestly is the
mantra towards a corruption-free happy world. To me, honesty is a quality that
involves being honest in every way of life.

Honesty is considered to be the most important virtue as this quality ensures
a balance and authentically structured society where each member would work
together towards a better world.

The virtues and good qualities are deeply rooted with honesty. Only an honest
person can be truthful, brave and benevolent. A dishonest person will start
acquiring other vile characteristics and with time s/he would become a
corrupted and harmful person in every sphere of life. Honesty makes a man
brave and happy. A dishonest person can't be truly happy and contended.

This is indeed a difficult quality to acquire if that was not rooted from the
early childhood of a person. The society and circumstances offer many
attractions and denying all of those devilish attractions and greed is
something an honest person would do. To me this is the first and fore-most
important quality a good person must have.

**Your ability to talk about this Cue Card Topic would enable you to talk about the following Cue Card Topics as well:**

  1. **Describe a good quality one of your friends has.**
  2. **Describe an important quality someone needs for success.**

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a factory or office you have visited.

**You should say:**

  * What type of office it is
  * What types of people work there
  * Why you went there

and explain what this factory or office produces or work for.

**Sample Answer:**  
Few months back I went to a call center office named ‘Tech 5’ where my friend
Ronald used to work. It was a huge office with more than 300 employees and was
in the entire 3rd floor of the Lotus building. This company is the largest
call center in our city and has employed many students and professionals.

There were two types of employees three: Full time &amp; Part time and
students mostly worked there as part time employees. Students with good
communication skill in English were eligible to be interviewed there. After
getting employed, the students could choose their preferred shift for work.
The full time employees were mostly in managerial, administrative and IT
networking jobs while the call center agents mostly were either students or
freshly graduated. There were some middle aged call center agents who took
this field as their long term profession and worked there from 9 to 5.

I went to meet my friend Ronald who was in office at that time. He asked me to
lend him some story books and was supposed to meet me near my home. But in the
evening he called me to meet him in his office so that I could give him the
books as well as talk to his manager regarding a part time job I was looking
for.

This company mainly relied on outsourcing and call center jobs. The agents in
this office were mostly young people who either called the end users for
selling products or services or received call to give certain information to
customers or to record their complaints about a particular product or service.
The office used to work for large multinational companies to provide the
customer care service or to promote their products or services. In return they
would earn from the commissions or contact amount. They also had a software
development and web designing team who used to work for the direct clients.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a bus or train station in your city.

**You should say:**

  * Where it is
  * What types of transportation are available there
  * How you can go there

and explain why people use this station.

**Model Answer:**  
I live at _(…say the area name…)_ in the _(…city name…)_ and this is 15
minutes driving distance from the bus terminal. This is one of the busiest bus
stations in our city. The area where I live in has a large number of
populations who use this station to go to different places every day. This bus
station is beside the old bridge area and adjacent to the gas station and
cantonment school.

Usually public buses, double deck buses, taxies and rent-a-cars are available
in this station. People can hire large private cars in case they want to hire
it for the entire day for long distance journey. Each day almost 5 thousand
people go to different places from this station.

I can reach the station in 15 minutes if I drive my car or around 20 minutes
if I take a taxi. It would take around an hour to reach there if I want on
foot. Alternatively I can take a tram bus to reach there and it takes around
25 minutes. Usually I go to my work place/ university from this bus station
and to reach this bus station I rely on the public bus that I can catch just
in front of my home.

This is the largest bus station in our area and buses travel almost in every
direction from here. People around this area come to this station first to
take a car to go to long distances. Even the inter-bus city service is
available only in this station and people have to get at this station first to
go outside our city. The train station is far away from our city and that’s
why people in our area mostly rely on this bus station to go to different
parts of the city or even outside the city.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe one of your typical days when you are not working or studying.

**You should say:**

  * What you do
  * How you enjoy it
  * How it is different from other days

and explain if you like it or not.

**Model Answer:**  
I am in my final term of my graduation and that’s why my life is bit tied up
with the routine as it should be for a student. When I do not have classes or
approaching exams, I try to spend my time is ease and relaxation so that I can
get refreshed and recharged.

On one such day, I get up late from bed and after that I take a good
breakfast. I then take shower and go to the shopping malls to purchase my
necessary stuffs. Since I do not get time every day, I do my shopping on my
free days.

I watch movies or TV serials till noon and try to eat outside with friends in
the evening. Sometimes I make plans to hang around with my friends at their
places and take my dinner in a restaurant. In the evening after I get back
home, I either read a novel or watch movies.

Hanging with friends, watching movies, listening to music, internet surfing
and spending time with family members are the main enjoyment I have during my
typical free days. Such a day is quite different from my other typical days as
I do not go to my university, do not read for 4-5 hours a day or even do not
spend time for approaching exams. In my opinion such days are important to get
relieved from the monotonous routines and scheduled life.

I really enjoy such days as I do not have much hurry to do everything. I enjoy
spending time with my family members and friends. I enjoy the relaxing mood I

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a classroom that you study or have studied in.

**You should say:**

  * What part of the school or college it was in
  * What it looked like
  * What things were in it

And say if you think the people who study there likeed it or not.

**Model Answer:**  
My primary school was in an urban area and the school was very nearer to a
flowing river and the stunning natural beauty surrounded us.  When I was
promoted to grade 3, we were transferred to a large class and that’s in my
experience is the best classroom I have ever had even though I had classes in
many ultramodern rooms later on. This classroom was in the North side of the
school and there were 3-4 windows and 2 large doors in this class. We could
see the flowing rivers and a part of hills from this classroom.

This room has an ‘L’ shape and could accommodate more than 50 students. It
looked similar to a large hall room except that it gave the impression of an
urban house. The furniture of this room was locally build and was all wooden.
There was a large black board where the teachers used to write with the white
chalks.

Most of the students liked this room because of the fresh air it could provide
to the students. The temperature during the summer was usually high and this
room was amazingly soothing. The ceiling was unusually high (around 20 feet
from the floor) unlike the rooms we see nowadays. We all loved to have classes
in this room and the teachers were very careful to us about studies and that’s
why even being a remote location and underfunded school, it could maintained a
steady results each year.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a food item that you often eat outside your home.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * How often you eat this food
  * Where it is available

And explain why you often eat it outside your home.

**Model Answer:**  
I often eat pizza in a fast food shop or in a food corner and I really like
this food item.  Pizza is not made in our home and that’s why I eat it outside
my home. Among the different shops and restaurants that offer pizza, I like
Dominos Pizza most. They often bring variations on their pizzas and I find it
convenient to go to a nearby Dominos Pizza shop and taste the pizza.

I usually eat 3-4 pizzas in a month but of course it varies. In some weeks I
mostly stay home and do not hang around with friends. In such weeks I do not
eat any pizza. But sometimes friends throw parties and I hang around with them
often and at that time I eat about 2 pizzas in a week. So on an average the
number is 3-4 in a month.  
There are plenty of fast-food shops, restaurants and specialized pizza shops
like Pizza Hut, Pizza Inn, Dominos Pizza, Yummy, Hot Pizza etc. that offer
pizza. Since fast-food shops have grown hugely nowadays, I get it nearby my
home, university and places I often go.

I like the taste and variations of the pizza and they are convenient to find
in a fast-food corner. Since it is not prepared at our home, I eat it outside.
My friends also like this food item and while ordering a food item, most of us
prefer the pizza. The prices are reasonable and it can be shared among
friends. Because of my personal preference of pizza and the convenience of
getting it, I often eat this food item outside home.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a piece of furniture you have at home.

**You should say:**

  * What it is
  * How long you have it
  * What are the usages of it

And explain why you have it at your home.

**Sample Answer:**  
I stay at our own house and my room still gives the impression of a student’s
room though I have recently finished my graduation. My favourite piece of
furniture at my home belongs to my room and it is the wooden bookshelf. This
is in fact a large bookshelf and it comprises all of my favourite books.

I have this wooden bookshelf for the last 3 years after my parents bought it
for me. Initially I had only few books to keep there and most of the part of
the shelf remained empty. But overtime, my book collection increased and the
bookshelf is not almost full.

There are 4 layers of this wooden bookshelf and the front side is made of
glass. I read plenty of story books and often visit the bookshops to purchase
new books. This bookshelf offers a good way of arranging all of my books and
secures them with the lock system it has. I often look at my bookshelf and
feel kind of proud to have a good collection of books.

My parents bought me this piece of furniture after noticing that I keep books
almost everywhere in my room and they thought it would be good idea to buy me
a bookshelf where I would be able to neatly arrange my books. This bookshelf
became very handy for me as it helped me keeping of my books.

country&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a common bird in your country.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * How it looks like
  * Where can you see it

And explain some common characteristics of this bird.

**Sample answer 1:**  
I live in England, and we are lucky in that we have many birds that visit our
gardens as lots of people like to put out food to feed them, especially in the
winter months.  I’m going to tell you about one such common but distinctive
bird.  I will explain what it is, describe its appearance as best I can, let
you know where you can see it and share with you some of its most common
characteristics.

The bird I’m thinking of is the Robin, sometimes it’s referred to as robin
redbreast, and it often features on wintry scenes on Christmas Cards.

These birds are very distinctive and enormously popular, in fact earlier in
2015 it was voted Britain’s favourite native bird, and I’m not at all
surprised.  They are easy to identify, and very confident around people, so
everyone knows a robin near to where they live.  Size wise I think they are
about five to five and a half inches in length.  They have a distinctly
rounded appearance, when they fluff up their feathers for warmth in winter
they can appear almost spherical, it makes you wonder how they can fly!  The
male and female are similar in colouration.  Despite their name ‘redbreast’ in
fact they have an orange breast and face lined with grey, then brown
upperparts and a whitish belly.  It is the orange which is most distinctive
though, I don’t think a robin has ever been wrongly identified!  I have been
told the reason they are called ‘redbreast’ even though their colour is
clearly orange, is because years ago there wasn’t a word for ‘orange’ in the
English language, and red was the nearest approximation, I don’t know if
that’s true, but it’s possible.

You can see robins in gardens everywhere.  They are noisy and territorial so
you will often only have one, or a pair in any patch of property.  Although
they are thought of as friendly because of how domesticated they appear with
people, they can be pretty vicious with each other.  It is not uncommon to see
a robin furiously hurling itself at its own reflection in a window pane,
attacking the glass with its wings and beak, thinking it is seeing off a
rival.  They are unconcerned by humans, not necessarily tame, but habituated
to people they have learned that they can benefit from some human behaviours.
For example, they will be attracted by the smell of newly turned earth, so if
you are gardening, or sweeping leaves it is a very common experience for a
robin to come and join you.  They will come really close, standing on the
handle of a garden fork to watch for worms or insets which they will then fly
down and eat.  It is very satisfying if you are digging to turn up a worm and
see a hungry robin seize it – less satisfying for the worm I suppose!

If you are living in the UK or even parts of Europe, I’m sure you’ll know this
bird already, but even if you don’t I’d be surprised if you hadn’t seen one on
a Christmas card or in a Christmas film at some point – they get everywhere.

**Model Answer 2:**  
The kingfisher is a common bird in our country and it is really a beautiful
bird. This bird probably got its name from its habit of catching fishes from
the ponds and lakes.

In a single word this is in my opinion is the most beautiful bird I have ever
seen. This bird has got red, blue, grayish, yellow and many other color
combinations on its father and the tail is usually longer than other birds.
The keen eyes, the speedy movement and its ability to catch fishes in the
blink of eyes make it a very distinguishable bird. In our country the bird is
very common in urban and village area where lots of ponds, lakes and rivers
are available. Since it catches fishes, it can be seen near the water mostly.

This bird is a fine hunter. The way it flies and catches fishes is simply
amazing. I have never seen any other birds that can catch fishes or other
insects so fast. The gorgeous colour combination, the thin and long tail makes
this bird exceptional from other birds. This bird can be seen mostly in the
morning and in the evening as fishes come to the upper side of the water at
that time. I really like this bird and definitely it is a bird of beauty and
skill.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a challenging job/ profession you know about.

**You should say:**

  * What it is
  * What qualification it requires
  * What are the responsibilities of this job

And explain why you think it as challenging.

**Sample Answer:**  
In my opinion being a Police officer is a challenging job. In fact I can
clearly understand this from my acquaintances with a friend of my brother
whose name is Jacob and who works a police officer in our city.

To work in the police force, someone must be a by-born citizen of this country
and has to finish at least 12 grades. Then comes the physical fitness and to
be allowed to be a police officer, someone must have minimum 5 feet 7 inch
height and a good physical structure and work stamina. The background of any
individual has to be neat and clean to be the part of the police department as
the authority always does a background check of the applicant. There is a very
rigid training that every selected individual has to pass to be finally
appointed in the work force.

The responsibilities are huge and honest. Every police officer takes oath to
serve the country and people. Their primary responsibility is to establish the
law in the society and track the people who do not abide by the laws. They
take challenges to find a criminal, they try to keep the peace in the society,
they work as the protector of the good people and they haunt down the bad
guys.

Being honest and maintaining the vows a police officer takes at the beginning
of his/her recruitment is a pretty challenging task. There are plenty of
opportunities to be corrupted and earning illegal money and a good police
officer has to refrain him/ her from this. The criminals in a society often
are the powerful people and a police officer has to take risk to control those
criminals. The officer must be ready to work any time needed and often stays
away from home and family for a long. In most of the countries the police
officers are not high paying employees of the country but the challenges they
takes (both psychologically and physically) are greater than most of the other
professionals. From my conversation with Jacob (the friend of my brother) I
learned many daring and puzzling challenges he has faced. He has even taken
challenges that could have easily killed him and yet he is not always honored
by people. This is a professional where new challenges and dangers always
await in the road.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a play ground or park where you played.

**You should say:**

  * Where it is
  * When you played there
  * Who you played with

And explain whether you liked this place or not.

**Sample Answer:**  
I grew up in a suburban area and there were plenty of parks, fields and play
grounds. But among those places, the school play ground where I used to play
often is one of my most favourite. This was a large open field in front of our
school and I played there more than 4 years from my grade 3 till grade 7. We
were not allowed to play in this play ground when we were supposed to attend
the classes. Apart from that we were allowed to play there whenever we wished.

I was around 7 years old when I got admitted in the City International School
and I was happy to have many good friends there. We used to play there during
the break period and even sometimes after the school. I still remember 3-4
friends of mine from my grade 4 who were my regular play mates in this play
ground. The childhood was magical and we enjoyed playing everything we knew we
could play. We even enjoyed the aimless running and hide-and-seek games we
played there. There were some special toys and playing tools arranged by the
school when we were promoted to class 5 but those were mostly for kids from
grade 1 and 2. So we did not use these toys and tools while paying as we knew
that those are only for small kids. The friends I played with were my class
mates as well and we were very intimate at that time.

I liked playing in this play ground very much. Actuality I liked it so much
that I still remember this play ground. I have played in many other play
grounds but while thinking about them, I found I miss this particular play
ground from my early school more than many other places where I played. That’s
why I picked it to talk about. I guess I will never forget my days of
childhood and my memory regarding this playground where I often played with my
classmates and friends.

  * how difficult it would be to have it fulfilled

**and explain what you need to do to achieve it.**

_[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]_

**Model Answer:**  
Goals and ambitions in our lives play important roles as they help us stay
focuses and plan accordingly to achieve them. We all have long term and short
term goals in our lives and we dream to achieve them all. One of the short
time goals or should I say ambition I currently have is to migrate to Canada/
UK/ USA/ Australia and settle there for couple of years.

I have finished my graduation in M.B.A from a reputed university in my country
and then worked for 2 years in a multinational company. The valuable
experience I gather during these 2 years would be very helpful for me to
further enhance my career. In the meanwhile, if I can work for a company
situated in a first world country that fosters multi-cultural work environment
and deals with top-notch businesses, would be a great uplift for my future.

I have decided to fulfil this goad 1 year ago and then started working
accordingly. In fact the IELTS exam I am participating in was a part of my
preparation to requirement fulfilment to achieve this goal.

So far I have been doing fine to be allowed to migrate to the country I have
targeted, but yet nothing is certain. I am hopeful that I would be able to
fulfil all the criteria I am required to complete to be allowed to go there.

In my country the working and training experience in a first world country is
esteemed greatly and to participate in our economy, I need to learn the
business ethics and idea from a country which is considered to be a pioneer in
it. This is the main reason I would like to go and work there. Apart from
that, it would allow me to enhance my knowledge, experience and would broaden
my horizon which would be very much beneficial for my future.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What kind of things give status to people in your country?

Q. Have things changed since your parents’ time?

Q. What are the important qualities to achieve our ambitions?

Q. Are all ambitions good in life?

Q. What type of ambitions young generation in your country has?

Q. Would you focus more on achieving your ambition or doing things you love to
do?

system-for-commuters-in-your-city&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a common transportation system for commuters in your city.

**You should say:**

  * What kind of transport it is
  * What types of people use this transport
  * How convenient it is

**And explain whether you like it or not.**

**Model Answer:**  
Public Bus is a very common transportation system in our country and the
majority of the commuters in cities and urban areas use this transportation
system. There are two types of public bus system in our country: short
distance buses and long distance buses. There are many governments owned bus
service system which is available mostly in metropolitan system. There are
varieties of sizes in these buses ranging from 10 seats to as many as 100
seats and even double-decker buses as well.

People from all classes and economic conditions use these buses and who do not
own private cars, most of the times use this transportation system. Since
there are cheap and expensive buses based on the facilities allowed, people
with low earnings mostly use the non-AC, small buses. While the people with
better economic conditions use air conditioned and bit expensive services.

This is the most convenient transportation system in our country in terms of
expenses and availability. Hiring taxi or private cars cost a lot and they are
not always available. So people mostly depend on the public bus transportation
system which offers a very low fair and are always available for almost all of
the destinations.

I mostly use this bus transportation system for short and long distance
travels and communications and I find it very handy. Thought there are some
disadvantages of this transportation system, I would say still this is the
best way for commuters to more to different places in my city.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What are some common transportations in your city?  
  
Q. How do most people travel long distances in your country?  
  
Q. Have the types of transport people use changed much over the last few
decades?  
  
Q. What kinds of improvement have there been in transport in your country in
recent years?  
  
Q. Do you think transport is likely to continue to improve in the future?  
  
Q. Do you think the government should impose a restriction on citizens' car
ownership?

**Your ability to talk about this Cue Card Topic would enable you to talk about the following Cue Card Topics as well:**

  1. **Describe a journey you took using public transportation.**
  2. **Describe a public transportation system available in your city.**
  3. **Describe the main transportation system available in your country.**

your-childhood&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a game you used to play in your childhood.

**You should say:**

  * What type of game it was
  * How you played it
  * Who you played it with

And explain why you don't play it anymore.

**Model Answer 1:**  
I spent my childhood in an urban area that was full of natural graces and
wonders. The vast green fields, rivers, hill, the blue sky and the playmates
of my childhoods were my best part of my lively and magical childhood. I used
to play lots of games in my childhood and among them blind-man's-buff was one
of my most favourite.

This game required minimum 4-5 kids to play. Initially one kid would be
selected to be blindfolded and his/her eyes would be tied up so that s/he
can't see anything. A big circle would be drawn and no one is allowed to go
out of this circle. The blind-folded kid would try to catch someone while
others would try to protect themselves but would not be able to go outside the
circle. If the blindfolded kid can touch someone and can say his/her name, the
blindfolded kid would get free and the other one who was touched would be
blindfolded this time. This was the basic rules of the game and we used to
play this game according to this rule.

I mostly played this game with my cousins, neighboring kids and classmates. I
was then around 4-5 years old and the other kids whom I used to play with were
around the same age.

As I recall, I played this game when I was a kid if 4-5 years old. Probably I
have not played this game after I was promoted to grade three. This was a game
played by kids and in our country this is played by the kids only. It is not
at all a game for the grown-ups and I have never seen any adult person playing
this game. So, I do not play this game anymore. Among the games I play still
now includes cricket, football, badminton, table tennis but not the blind-
man's-buff at all. This was a game for kid and I enjoyed this game as a kid.

**Model Answer 1:**  
It is quite fun to think back to games I used to play when I was little.  I’m
going to tell you about a particular game I used to play, how it was played
and who with, and try and come up with an explanation as to why I don’t do it
anymore when it was so much fun at the time!

I think the time when I played most games with friends was when I was at
junior school; that would be up to the age of about ten or eleven.  At morning
and lunchtime breaks we were all turfed out of the school building to play
outside whatever the weather, and that meant we played a lot of large group
games.  Some games are probably played in various ways the world over, chasing
games like ‘tag’ for example, or a rather boisterous game we called British
Bulldog which was eventually banned in our school for being too dangerous!
That involved somebody being ‘it’ and everyone else rushing from one side of
the playground to the other, ‘it’ meant being the catcher, and they had to
somehow bring down as many people as they could, in whatever way they fancied,
to stop them making it across the space.  Anyone they floored in this way also
became catchers, until everyone was ganging up against the few individuals
left!  There were a lot of bloody noses… Happy Days!   However, I digress, the
game I want to tell you about is a bit different.  It is called ‘conkers’ and
we could only play it at a particular time of year.

In autumn, in England, horse chestnut trees produce seeds which are beautiful
shiny spheres of deep chocolate colour, encased in a spikey green fleshy
shell.  The game consists of first gathering up suitable conkers from the
ground where they have fallen of the trees.  You have to select a robust
looking conker and then drill a hole in it using whatever sharp implement you
have to hand that your parents don’t know about it!  You then thread your
conker onto a string or shoelace, with a large knot at the end to stop it
falling off the thread.  Next you find an opponent, who has a similarly
carefully selected conker on a string.  One player holds their conker in front
of them dangling on a thread, and the other tries to strike it with their own
conker.  Players take it in turns until one conker breaks, and the other is
declared victorious.  The winning conker becomes a ‘one-er’ after beating one
conker, a ‘two-er’ after destroying two and so on.  It also takes on the score
of any other conkers it successfully breaks  Some games were friendly with
your mates, others were much more challenging, when you had a really high
scoring conker, other players would want to take you on to try and smash your
now much prized horse chestnut seed!

The game could get very competitive, and if I’m honest, a bit dangerous too,
with small children furiously smashing each other’s conkers perilously close
to each other’s faces and shards of shattered conker flying off in all
directions!  Some people would take the ‘game’ very seriously; tricks were
employed to harden conkers.  For example, you could ‘cheat’ by slowly baking a
conker in an oven or soaking it in vinegar.  Even so, there was real prestige
attached to having a conker that survived many games, so the stakes were high!

I stopped playing conkers after I left junior school.  This was probably
partly because there weren’t horse chestnut trees to pass on the way to school
any more, this meant there were no more carpets of fallen conkers to choose
from enroute to the playground.  However, it was also because at senior school
it would have been seen as ‘babyish’ to play such games any more, senior
school students were far too cool and sophisticated to shriek with laughter as
they smashed each other’s conkers on strings during break times!  Writing this
though has made me think that maybe this autumn I will find myself a conker
and a wiling friend, and see if we can have as much fun playing together as we
used to as children.  I suspect we will… though I fear we may also find we are
even more furiously competitive than we were in childhood, still who says
growing old means you have to grow up?!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a song that you remember from your childhood.

**You should say:**

  * What was it
  * When you heard it
  * Who sang this song to you

**and explain why you still remember this song.**

**Model Answer:**  
My mother often sang me a lullaby titled ‘Oh my sweet angel look the Moon has
come to play with you…” in my bed time and I have heard it so many times in my
childhood that I can still remember it very vividly. This was a song usually
famous in the rural area of our country that mothers often use to soothe the
baby and to send them in sleep. It was an 8-10 lines song with great harmony
and the way my mother sand it was extraordinary. It still echoes in my head
and I miss those days.

I can remember my mother often sand this song till I got admitted in the
school and I heard it from my father as well in my bed time. I was pretty
touched with the lyrics and in my childhood I often imagined that the verses
used in this song were true and would happen to me as well.

We often remember things from childhood specially the stories or songs we hear
with great enthusiasm. This song was no exceptions. I heard it hundreds of
times and as a child I fanaticized those things to be true. Thais is the main
reason I still remember it. May be someday when I will become a father/
mother, I will sing thins song to my children as well. This has in fact become
a permanent memory and I still love the great and calming piece of music.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a friend who has played an important part in your life.

**You should say:**

  * Who was s/he
  * How you met
  * How long you two known each other

and explain what important part he played in your life.

**Model Answer:**  
I always consider myself to be extremely lucky to have many close friends who
have raised their helping hands in times when I desperately needed. Thus I
have many real friends who are not only friends in good times but also for bad
times. One such friend is Ricardo who helped me greatly and his contribution
in my life has placed him in an important and special position in my life.

This was the time when I was a fresher in my college and I became acquainted
with Ricardo. Our friendship grew deeper with time and we became very close
friends. In my second year, I got involved in a local group and I was mostly
interested in their theater performance. I never knew they were indirectly
involved in politics and were funded by the major political party of our city.
When I got suspicious of this group’s activity I submitted my resignation and
then the real dilemma started. They would not allow me to leave intentionally
and started showing me how much they have already done for me. Somehow I did
not care and left this group. After few months, the group was accused of doing
a political vandalism and an act against the law and I got trapped. As they
have not permitted me officially to resign, I was shown as an active member of
this group. I was quite in trouble as my college authority took it as a
serious threat towards their disciplinary rules and they started interrogating
me.

In fact I had no big connections and influences to get out from this whole
trap and my friend Ricardo came to save me from this ploy with every
connections and influences he had. I knew him merely for only 2 years at that
time and to my surprise he did everything humanly possible to save me from the
disgrace.

In fact because of his help and advice, I had been able to save myself from an
unknown danger and disgrace. Even the college authority would not have been
listened to me if he was not there for me. Thus he has saved me from a
disastrous experience I might have to face.  After that I started feeling an
immense gratitude towards him and consider his help as an important part of my
life.

I live in Australia and this country is considered to be a dream land for
tourists. With mesmerizing natural beauty, sacred aboriginal places, coral
reefs, red deserts, famous man made architectures, staggering contrast and
spectacular views make it an idea place for tourists all over the world.

One of the famous tourist destinations in my country is Daintree National
Park. This is situated in Far North Queensland and was founded in the year
1981. It became the part of the World Heritage in 1988 and this is one of the
most visited tourist spot in Australia. This place is one of the most ancient
ecosystems on earth and well-known for the exceptional biodiversity it offers.

People from all over the Australia as well as from the foreign countries come
to visit this place. People who visit this place include children to older
people and the natural inhabitants attract tourists who love to visit natural
wonders more than the man-made constructions.

The diverse ecosystem of this place comprises more than 18 thousand plant
species and a vast array of animal species. Stunning beauty, diverse
ecosystem, vast array of animals and plants, wonderful experience of sunset
and the rainforests are few of the attractions of this place. This place has
so many marvels and livelihood to offer that people often visit here more than
once.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What are some tourist attractions in your country?

Q. Should these places be free for everyone to visit?

Q. Do foreigners visit these attractions? Where do they mostly come from?

Q. What are the benefits of foreigners visiting tourist attractions in your
country?

Q. What are the disadvantages of it?

Q. Do you know about any environmental issues associated with it?

  * Who this person is
  * What s/he does
  * What kind of responsibility that person has

And explain how well that person deals with his or her responsibilities.

**Model Answer:**  
In my opinion my father is a person who has lots of responsibilities and he
has a good quality of balancing these responsibilities with his daily life.

First of all, he works in a government organization and on an average he
spends 9 hours a day in his office. Though I don’t know the details of his
every job responsibility, I have a good idea of his duties and this is a tough
job position to hold. He is responsible for maintaining the education sector
of the town and everyday he has to spend a busy time at his office. I have
visited his office several times and always found him busy in meeting with the
teachers of different education institutes as well as other government
officers.

Beside his duty towards the country and the government, he maintains a family
of 12 members. I have 3 siblings and two of my uncles live with us. My
grandmother lives with us and my father is the only earning member of this big
family. Apart from the expenses, he spends his time very wisely to keep in
touch with all family members. He takes care of our education, balance
nutrition and treatment. He is a hard working person and he does many of our
family tasks.

He is a social worker as well and often attends the community meetings. As a
decision making members of this welfare community society, he performs many
works there as well.

One of his greatest responsibilities is to take care of his mother and
amazingly he is very good at it. Sometimes I wonder how come he can manage so
many things so well!  
In my opinion my father is a good-hearted, hard working person who maintains
an exemplary life with lots of duties and responsibilities.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something you use for your work or studies.

**You should say:**

  * What it is
  * How you use it
  * How often you use it

And say if you would be able to do you work or studies without this thing.

**Model Answer:**  
I have recently completed my graduation majoring Bachelor of Business
Administration and have joined a financial service providing organization
recently. The laptop I have is really handy in terms of my works. I used it
for my studies as well and this laptop has become an inevitable part of my
work.

I use my laptop to store my valuable documents, to get various information
from internet and also to do numerous works like contacting my collages,
processing word documents, sending and reading emails etc. The spreadsheet
software is very handy to present and calculate data, the presentation
software like Power Point enables me to create presentations and the Microsoft
Project enables me to plan and track the ongoing projects in my office.

I use this laptop almost 4-6 hours every day during my office period and even
in my days off I use it 3-4 hours each day on an average. Honestly speaking,
it would be quite impossible to manage my work without this device and if I
have to discard this device from my work life, the productivity would decrease
significantly. Speedy communication, automated project management, processing
a huge number of data and storing them in a save manner would become pretty
complex without the laptop.

I consider this device to be the most essential thing for my work and without
it; I won’t be able to manage my works. With time we have become so much
dependent on this device that, we are not in a position to continue our work
without it.

**Your ability to talk about this Cue Card Topic would enable you to talk about the following Cue Card Topics as well:**

  1. **Describe something you often use.  **
  2. **Describe an electronic device you own.**
  3. **Describe a tool or device you have at home.**

  5. **Describe something you often use for your study.**
  6. **Describe something valuable you own.**

##  Describe a workplace you have worked in or know about.

**You should say:**

  * What it looks like
  * Who worked there
  * How you know about it

and explain if this is a good working environment or not.

**Model Answer:**  
I am yet to finish my graduation and that’s why I am not engaged in any full
time job. However, I worked for a foreign company as a part time survey
officer and was really impressed with the workplace they offered.

That was a 6 story modern building and they owned it. I worked in 3rd floor
and the office was pretty neat and friendly for the employees. The cubicles
were large enough and the friendly environment of this office gave a very
positive impression about this company. There were many foreigners and local
employees there and most of them were business consultant, admin and team
leads. I personally worked with a team who were specialized in data mining and
database designing. There were many software engineers who were engaged in
developing software.

I knew about his office from a bulletin board of my university that offered
different important noticed for the students and faculty. I noticed the job
offer and was interested about it. Since, I worked for this company for more
than 8 months; I know it from my first-hand experience.

To me this was an ideal working environment that maintained a good balance
about the working environment, facilities and options for recreations and
study. A whole floor was dedicated for the library and reference works which
is really rare in many companies. To surmise, I found it to be a very pleasant
and friendly workplace where employees are self-motivated to work for the
company.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a famous scientist or artist in your country.

**You should say:**

  * Who is s/he
  * What s/he did
  * How you know about him/her

And explain why s/he is famous.

**Sample Answer: **  
I am from United States and Thomas Alva Edison was a great scientist, inventor
and a well renowned person from my country.

He was born in 1847 and contributed towards many inventions till his death in
1931. His invention and tools greatly influenced the human around the world.
He is considered as one the greatest scientists and inventors of all time and
almost everybody around the world know his name and contributions for the
world. His most popular inventions include electric bulb, motion picture
camera, phonograph, carbon microphone, fluoroscopy and the improvement of
telegraph technology. He was a devoted scientist, creative mind and a prolific
inventor who had more than 1000 US patents in his name.

I first learned about him when I was only 5 years old. My grandpa one day told
me about the light bulb and said story about this great inventor. Later I
learn about him from a book I read about his life. In my university years, I
read several other books on different scientists and inventions and Thomas
Alva Edison was in all of these books.  
His childhood and passion for new invention were so interesting that, I hear
many stories of this genius from my friends. As I recall, I watched a TV
documentary show in Discovery Channel that emphasized the great contribution
of this scientist.

He is, without any question, a man who contributed in the progress of human
civilization. Many of his inventions were pure genius and unparallel. Many of
his inventions and researches are still the motivation for scientists and
science students. In many countries he is still a part of the national
syllabus in text books. People revere this highly talented person and will
remember his as a symbol of mastermind.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an important export item in your country.

**You should say:**

  * What it is
  * How it is produced or manufactured
  * Who work to make it

And explain why it is an important export item in your country.

**Model Answer:**  
There are quite a few significant export items we have in our country which
bring a large portion of our total foreign revenue and help up boost up our
overall economy and among them I would like to talk about the tea we export to
more than 20 countries. In our country, a vast area is used for growing tea
plants and the quality we produce for war and packet-tea is world class. This
is in fact one of the top 5 gross foreign earning export items for us.

The tea is mainly produces in the hill track and low area of the southern part
of our country where we have a large number of farmer s working on that. The
weather, rain and land required for good tea productions are available in this
part of the country and we have many industries there to collect and produce
the finest tea.

The tea gardens are owned by either individuals or government and they engage
a large number of farmers to work on the tea gardens. After the tea leaves are
ready to be collected, the farmers and other workers collect those leaves,
clean it and then send it to the factories there those leaves are processed
and after rigid quality assurances and strict guidance those are made ready to
be packed.

The tea industry is a vast area where lots of people in different sectors are
involved including farmers, care-takers, factory workers, manufacturers,
engineers, QA, food officers, packing workers, transportation and preserving
workers. Besides these, the owners and their appointed officers and employees
also work in this industry.

Tea is one of the major foreign revenue earing sources for our country and we
produce high quality products. Around 2% of our total population is directly
involved in this sector and this has created a huge job opportunity. Moreover,
this industry is expanding year by year and we are getting more countries in
our export list. In terms of a major production of our country, job
opportunity, foreign revenue earning, tea is a very important export items for
us.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a food you like to eat at home.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * How it is prepared
  * Who prepares it at your home

and explain why you like it.

**Model Answer:**  
I like to eat fried rice with vegetable and fish curry at home. In fact this
is a common dinner item in our country and I often eat these items at home.
Fried rice is prepared by boiling the rice and then fried with eggs and
vegetables. Vegetables are mixed and prepared by using other spices and water.
Finally fish curry is cooked using the fish, spices, water, oil and salt. When
these items are cooked individually, they are served together for either the
lunch or dinner.

At our home my mom mostly does the cooking stuffs. She most of the time
prepares this food item but sometimes my younger sister helps her cooking this
item. The fried rice with egg, vegetable and fish are my most favourite menu.
I eat this menu at least 4-5 times in a week and yet I never get bored with
this menu. If I eat rich foods like Chinese menu or Thai menu 2/3 times in a
week in a restaurant, I feel like not to have it again. But the menu I am
talking about is quite delicious, tasty and nutritious. One will never feel
uninterested eating it.

This is a common dish in our country and because of the geographical location
we grow plenty of paddies, vegetables, and have lots of fishes in our rivers
and ponds.  
My mother has a special skill of cooking and the fried rice with vegetable,
and fish curry she cooks is simply second to none. These are the main reasons
for me to like this menu.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a place where you would like to have a home.

**You should say:**

  * Where is it
  * What the place look like
  * how you know about this place

What work you will do if you live there.

**Model Answer:**  
Well, today I want to speak about the place where I would like to have a home.
Firstly I want to say that I am that kind of person who enjoys living in
countryside. High-rise buildings, bumper to bumper traffic, incessant roar of
buses, industrial zones which give me urban life cannot make me feel
blissfully happy as peaceful countryside's life with its well worth seeing
landscape and the clearest air without any exhaust fumes.  
  
A place where I would like to have a home is one of the islands of Greece,
Santorini. It is a place with breathtaking scenery where sandy beach stretches
along the skyline. Santorini is a city of quaint old buildings surrounded by
narrow cobbled streets, where update has been kept old traditions. The
majority of buildings in this area are covered by white and blue colors, what
gives to the city spectacular view.  
  
If I am not mistaken a few years ago while watching a TV program I heard some
information about this place that impact me and then I started to search
something about this city on the internet.  
  
Actually my dream came true last year, when I traveled to the Greece and could
see this wonderful place which was much more attractive than I used to dream.
If I will get a chance to have a house and lived there, I am going to accept
it and run over there once and for all. I think I can set up a business there
and make a big money. Feeling stream winds, walking on golden sands, and every
day watch at panoramic beach that interflows with blue horizon can be the
essential reason why I will choose to live there.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an experience when you lost something.

**You should say:**

  * What you lost
  * How you lost it
  * Where you lost it

And explain how you felt about it.

**Model Answer:**  
I was in the second year of my university and at that time I lost my laptop
with some other necessary papers and the experience was so bitter that I still
remember it. I was on my way to home from the university and I took a public
bus to reach home. I had my bag with me that contained my laptop, charger,
some music DVDs, a pen drive, 2 books and some other necessary papers. I lost
the bag so the things that I had in my bag were also lost.

I remember that I had my bag with me and I had to stand inside the bus as
there was no seat available. After an hour I left the bus and took a shared
taxi. Finally I walked for a while to reach home and when I entered my room, I
felt that the bag is missing. I got so tensed and get back to the street and
tried to remember exactly where I lost the item. But I could not remember
exactly where I lost my bag.

I felt so low and depressed that I could not sleep at night. Even though I
knew that it was impossible to get the stuffs back, I tried hard to have those
items back. I reported to the nearby police station, contacted with the bus
authority but after 7-8 days I gave up all the hopes I had to get my items
back. I felt like a child who lost his most important toys! The laptop was
really important to me as it has lots of valuable study materials and other
files. I felt so stupid that, I was blaming myself for the whole thing and
rebuked me not to be more careful. Honestly, the whole experience and the
feelings were pretty depressing.

**Alternative Answer: **  
Thank you very much for the opportunity you gave me to talk about my
experience of losing something. In my preparation time for the given topic I
thought about many occasions when I lost something and finally I decided to
talk about the experience I had when I lost my University ID card. In fact, I
had to go through a series of events because I lost this ID card and probably
that’s why I have remembered this event very clearly.

I lost my ID card when I was in the 4th semester in my university.  I remember
putting the ID card in my pocket while leaving home and to reach the
University. I took a public bus and then a shared taxi on my way and I don’t
know exactly where I lost it but noticed it while entering the library of my
University where every student is advised to show his/her ID card. That’s the
first time I noticed that the ID card is no longer is in my possession and I
searched every possible place of my dress, bag and even in the classroom. But
to my dismay, I could not find it anywhere.

This ID card was pretty important to me as it was required to enter the
University building, library or even in exam rooms and labs. This was the only
valid form of Identification Card that I had at that time to show anyone in
case I needed to. Let’s say, if there is an emergency check post on the road,
and the police men ask me to show my identity, that was the only piece of
valid Identification proof for me. So losing it was a disaster to me at that
time.

I felt pretty bad and was blaming myself for being such a careless person. I
wrote an application to the University authority and they suggested me to make
a General Diary to the nearest police station. I had to submit several
applications and had to publish lost item news in the newspaper before I was
issued another ID card after almost fifteen days. In the meanwhile I had to
face lots of problems and had to submit several applications that made me
remember this event pretty vividly.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a jewellery or cosmetic item you often use.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * How often you use it
  * When you sue it

and explain why you use it often.

**Model Answer:**  
I am not like many other girls who like to wear jewellery item almost always.
In fact I have only 2/3 jewellery items that I own and I do not always use all
of them. The fashion bracelet made of gold and diamond is the only jewellery
item that I often use.

I use it almost every day except the days when I stay home or go out for
swimming. I like the fine quality this bracelet has. The gold and diamond made
bracelet that I have is a kind of fashion item to me because of its thick
slick and beautiful design. I find it fashionable, handy and easy to wear. For
all these reasons I use it often.

This was a gift from my mother on my 22nd birthday and I was so glad to have
it from my mother. At that time I noticed that, it was the most expensive gift
I have ever got and the design and my mom’s affection were both important to
me. This was the first time I got somehow inspired and motivated to wear a
jewellery items. I still use it pretty often because I admire it as a gift
from my beloved mother and the item is still fashionable and beautiful to me.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

###  Describe a common transportation or vehicle in your city that you often
use.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * What is it like
  * When do you use it

and explain why did you choose to use this form of transport.

**Model Answer:**  
Today I am going to tell you about a common form of transport that I use in
the city where I live.  What it is, when I use it, what it is like and why I
choose to use it. I am going to tell you about buses in Sheffield where I
live, this is a form of public transport that many people use to travel to and
from work or around the city at night.

I live in a city called Sheffield.  There can be a lot of traffic in the city,
and it is difficult to find anywhere to park if you use your own transport.
Therefore, many people prefer to use the public buses.  There are lots of
buses in Sheffield and many bus stops.  There is a bus stop almost directly
outside my house.  Buses come past every 15 minutes, if you want the bus to
stop, you have to put out your hand to signal the driver or the bus will go
straight pass!  When I get on, there is a fixed fare as I have a special
travel pass.  It costs me £1.20 for every journey, however far it is.  That is
about 39,000 VD.  There are bus stops every 500 metres or so, if there are
people waiting the bus will stop, if not, the bus goes straight on.  The bus
has two levels, a top deck and a bottom deck.  I like to climb up the stairs
to the top deck, and sit right at the front of the bus.  Then you get great
views across the streets and the city too.

I use the buses all the time, because they are cheap, convenient and safe.  I
sometimes use the bus to get to work, but mainly I use the bus when I am out
at night, as it will get me home safely.  The buses run quite late, but you
have to be careful to catch the last bus home or it will be a long walk back!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a plan (not related to work or study) you have for the future.

**You should say:**

  * what is it
  * what you would need to achieve it
  * how long you have this plan

and explain how difficult it would be to fulfil it.

**Model Answer:**  
I have a plan to establish a play-ground for kids and a club for the adults in
my hometown. This is something I missed a lot in the place where I grew up and
that’s the why I have the plan and determination to achieve it.

Establishing a kid’s playground adjacent to a club for grown-up people would
not be an easy task. I will need to manage the necessary budget, manpower and
financial support to actually do that. I will have to be financially rich and
connected with the local authority and political leaders to start the plan I
have. Honestly, I have this plan for a very long. When I got admitted in my
high school, the realization started popping up in my mind that these are two
things that our community is missing although they are very important. I knew
that was something pretty tough to achieve, but yet I started fostering this
tough plan in my mind.

As I already said, that would be pretty tough as it involves money, space,
power, and people’s involvements. There would be lots of obstacles and I would
have to face and resolve in order to fulfill the plan I have. The
determination and good will along with the prudent decision would be required.
If I do not possess a great enthusiasm and strength of mind, it would become
almost impossible to achieve it.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe the career you hope to have in the future.

**You should say:**

  * What the job is
  * What is involves
  * Why you chose it

and explain why you are interested about this job.

**Model Answer:**  
Today I am going to talk about my Dream Job for the future.  I am going to
tell you what the job is, what it involves and why I’d like to do it. My dream
job would be to be a travel writer!

Travel writers are often self-employed.  They travel the world to interesting
places and then write magazine, newspaper and internet articles about their
experiences.  To do this job you have to be willing to go to lots of new
places.  You also need to be able to write fluently and in different styles
for different publications.  Travel writers must be very flexible, as you
might need to go to difficult or uncomfortable places and to travel at short
notice. Often travel writers need to have another job a well, as,
unfortunately, you can’t really make a living out of this type of work.

The reason I would like to do this job so much, is that I love going to new
places.  Coming to Vietnam has been a new and wonderful experience for me.  I
would enjoy telling other people what it was like and encouraging them to go
on an adventure of their own.  I also like communicating ideas in writing, it
would be wonderful to make a living out of the two things I enjoy most –
travel and writing!

Unfortunately, there are very few opportunities to make a living as a travel
writer, so I think it might have to stay as my Dream Job, rather than my Real
Job!  Even so, I think it is important to have a dream, because otherwise how
can you ever have a dream come true!

that-you-often-use&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a common vehicle in you city that you often use.

**You should say:**

  * What it is
  * How often you use it
  * How much it cost to travel in it

And explain why you often use it.

**Model Answer:**  
Under pass train is a common vehicle type in my city and I often use this
transportation system. Though bus is the most common transportation system in
my city, there are so many people who use the under pass trains to reach to
their academic and work places.

I use the trains almost 5-8 times a week to reach my work place/ university.
While returning home, I take the taxi as train schedule in the evening
contradicts my schedule. The train is much cheaper than the public bus or taxi
in my city. Since, I do not own a car I need to rely on the public
transportation systems and the train costs only few dollars per week. Someone
can have a train pass for the whole month only for 50 dollars and this would
allow him/her to travel any places within the city as many time as he/she
needed.

The train station is in walking distance from my living place and that’s the
primary reason I prefer this transportation to reach my university/ work
place. I do not have to wait for a long and usually I can get a moderate seat
in it. There is no traffic jam to kill my time on the road and that’s another
important reason for my preference for this train transportation system.
Finally, I can save a great deal of money using the train over taxi or other
sorts of transportation system. Because all of these facilities and advantages
I often use this transportation system.

**Alternative Answer:**  
The tram bus is a common vehicle in my hometown and I often use it to travel
to different parts of the city. I often use this tram bus to reach my
university/ work place and to return home. On an average, I use this
transportation 3-5 days a week.

Tran bus in my city is a cheap way to travel compared to other forms of
transportations like taxi, shuttle train, or private car. Tram bus is cheap,
easily available and a safe mode of transportation system for me. I do not
have to wait for a long to catch a tram bus and it has a diverse route
throughout the city which makes it an ideal form of transportation for the
city people. I most of the time enjoy my journey in these buses especially
when I can get a seat beside the window of the bus. I can watch the natural
scenarios besides the roads and the ticketing system of this bus has become
online. I can get tickets or a pass card f the tram bus from home using
internet and that is another reason I prefer this transportation system over
other available form of transportation in my city.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe someone who is very brave.

**You should say:**

  * Who is s/he
  * How you know him/ her
  * What s/he does

And explain why you think s/he is a brave person.

**Model Answer:**  
To me my mother is the bravest person I have ever known and met. She was a
fighter from her early teenage. She lost her parents when she was only 14 and
after that she had taken life as a challenge. Strangely, with her bravery and
determination, she has established herself as a successful Doctor. She did an
extraordinary job to be able to get admitted in the top-notch State-owned
Medical College and achieved a promising result in her medical years.

She is my mother and I know her even before I started my breathing in this
world. I have been living with her for my whole life and she is very close to
me. She is the person I consider as my role model. I admire her very much and
I have never seen her compromise with rights and justice.

By profession, she is a doctor and she is in fact a very renowned doctor in
our locality. She is popular for her benevolent character and bravery. People
often seek for her advice when needed. She treats the poor people for free and
even purchases medicine for them with her own money. Besides, she is a doting
mother of 3 children and a loving wife of my father. It amaze me how she
perfectly balances her professional and personal life.

Her life was a challenge for her and she has faces almost all of the adversity
the luck can through to someone. Facing these adversities and successfully
overcoming them is a very challenging job. She has done that with bravery and
intelligence. Sometimes facing a problem in life and making a good solution is
even harder than facing a fierce wild animal and in this perspective my mother
has faced many demons and defeated them all. In her personal and professional
life, she is a brave and exemplary character. I have seen her fight with
politically powerful leaders to establish the right of a poor girl, mother or
working class people. That requires gut and nerve and my mother has these all.

  * How much it would cost you
  * How you would use it

and explain why you would buy it.

**Model Answer:**  
I am pretty sure if I get a large amount of money right now, I will buy a nice
car. The car would be Ford Fusion series latest car with all the latest
technology that a car can offer.  
This would cost around 45 thousand USD and would require some additional cost
to own and maintain it. I would mostly use it to go to places I regularly go
and the car would give me the freedom to choose my own schedule and my
dependency on the local buses.

We have a family car that 7-8 persons of our family share and I often have to
take local bus to reach my university/ work place. Since I don’t have a car, I
often discard the idea of visiting a friend or relative who stays a long away
from our house. My own car would facilitates me to visit these places and
travel to my workplace/ university easily and in less time.

I often dream of having a car and somehow I have a weakness of purchasing a
car from Ford brand. The fusion series cars are really good looking and come
with latest technology a car can offer. So, I will buy this car if I can
manage the amount it would require or let’s say I get the amount all of a
sudden.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a computer game you have played.

**You should say:**

  * What it was
  * When you played it
  * What the game was about

**And explain how you played this game.**

**Sample Answer:**  
For a long time I do not play computer games as I got busy with other tasks
and can hardly manage time nowadays but I was a hardcore fan of the game Age
of Empires 2. This was a strategy game developed by Ensemble Studios and
published by Microsoft Studios.  There were three series of this game and I
played the second series called Age of Empire the Conqueror. This was a
historic strategy games that the gamers could have played either in single
player or in multiplayer mode.

I mostly played it when I was 16-18 years old. I usually played it against
computer competitors and sometimes against my friends over the computer
network.  
There were several civilizations that a player had to pick from and then
develop this civilization in every aspect to protect it from the attack of
other civilizations. Each civilization had its own strength and weakness and
the player had to control the game for a long time. The different soldiers,
defense mechanism, war strategy, war defense and research and different
technologies made it a really interesting game.

I often played it against computer when I picked a civilization and computer
had other 3 civilizations. We fought each other and often I won the games
against computer in Hard game mode. I often played against my friends and that
was a different experience as I had to compete against real human. That was
more competitive and I enjoyed thoroughly playing against my friends.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. Do you think that playing computer games has an advantage for children?
Why?  
  
Q. Do you think computer games make them more violent or help them to be less
violent? Why?  
  
Q. What type of computer games are popular in your country? Why?  
  
Q. Can computer games be a part of our education and learning? How?  
  
Q. Why computer games are becoming more popular? What is better in your view:
virtual or physical communication? Why?  
  
Q. What changes you have noticed between the computer games in the last decade
and these days?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe the job you have.

**You should say:**

  * What the job is
  * What is involves
  * Why you chose it

and explain why you are interested about this job.

**Model Answer:**  
Today I am going to talk about my current job when I am at home in the UK.  I
will tell you what the job it, what it involves, why I chose it and why I am
interested in the role. My job title is Careers Adviser.  I do not think you
have this job role in Vietnam!   A Careers Adviser provides information,
advice and guidance to help people make realistic choices about their
education, training and work.   I work at a university, but some Careers
Advisers work in schools.

My job involves talking to students about their ideas for the future.  I help
them to identify what skills they have and link this to possible career ideas.
Because there is only one of me, and there are a lot of students I also
deliver a lot of group work sessions for students.  For example, I might run a
series of workshops on topics such as: Employability: Understanding your
skills; How to research career ideas; Where to look for jobs; How to write a
great CV or How to do well at Interviews.

If I’m very honest I didn’t really chose my job, it chose me!  When I was a
student I had no idea what I wanted to do.  I did lots of different jobs and
wasn’t very happy in any of them.  Then I went to meet a Careers Adviser, and
thought ‘I’d love to do that’.  Spend my day talking to people about how they
can get from where they are now to where they’d like to be in the future!’

To become a Careers Adviser I had to do one year’s training full time, and a
further year ‘on the job’.  Later on I did another Postgraduate course to gain
even more knowledge.

The job is rewarding, and fun, but it can be hard too.  I like to help people
and I enjoy discussing their ideas.  The best bit of the job is when a student
I have been working with comes and tells me because of my help they have got a
job that is the first step on the way to a brilliant future career!  I hope
one da all of you get your dream jobs too.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a seminar or rally that you participated in.

**You should say:**

  * What it was about
  * When you attended
  * What you did

And explain why you attended the seminar or rally.

**Sample Answer:**  
Few months back I participated in a seminar that was conducted by the city
council to create the awareness among people so that they prudently use the
water. It was probably the month of December and I was present in this
seminar. In fact one of my friends was an active member of the city welfare
committee and he insisted me to join this seminar. This was mainly focused to
request people to use water in a sensible way. The city authority was having a
great problem regarding the unexpected increase of water demand and they found
that more than 20% water can be saved if people use little senses and become
aware of the great problems of the scarcity of water supply.

It was in the evening and was conducted in a large open field. There were
around 400 people present in this seminar. The seminar started with the speech
from the city counselor and then other guests gave their speeches. Many
interesting information and facts were presented on this seminar and it was so
touchy that I promised myself that I would be very careful not to waste a
single drop of water from now on.

I was mostly the listener of the great speeches given by the participants. I
was sitting at the front row and watched the slides presented in the seminar.
Then a rally was conducted in our neighborhood and I walked with the people
and hold a placard that said ‘Save water, save the future’.

I actually went there because of my friend’s request. But later on I realized
that it was a good seminar to attend and from this seminar I actually got
inspiration to attend such seminars and rallies. My overall experience of this
seminar was pretty good.

use&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a fashion item you often use.

**You should say:**

  * What it is
  * How often you use it
  * Why you use it

And explain how you feel about using it.

**Model Answer:**  
My wristwatch is a fashion item that I often use and this has become a very
handy fashion item for me over time. This is a watch by Fast Track brand and I
bought it last year. To me this is a trendy fashion item and I love to wear it
daily. Whenever I go out, I wear it. It has become a part of my dress-up and I
rarely forget to wear this fashion item whenever I go out for work or
university.

For a long I did not wear a watch but when I got myself admitted in the
university, I felt the urge to buy one to maintain the tight schedule that I
have in my university. I basically bought it for two reasons: to know the time
and to wear it as a fashion item as I really liked the design of this watch.
Now I use it as part of my casual or formal dress-up and to know the time
whenever needed.

I can compare the time when I was not in the habit of wearing a wrist watch
with the time I start wearing it. I often had to ask others about the time and
could not reach my classes due to my unawareness of the current time. Now I
feel great about wearing it. It is a fashion item that I feel really good and
trendy to wear as well as I can get updated always about the time. I can plan
ahead and schedule my tasks as I am always aware of the time. Honestly, that
has become an important part of my daily life.

##  Describe an amusement park you went to.

**You should say:**

  * Where it is
  * When you went there
  * Why you went there

And explain what you did there.

**Sample Answer: **  
For a long I have not been to a park or amusement park but my visit to a
renowned amusement park in our city last year was so pleasant that I look
forward to revisit there. The amusement park I am talking about is nearly 40
kilometer away from the city where I live in and is a large one. It is beside
the City resort and occupies around 12 acres area.

I went there with my parents, 4-5 cousins and 2 nephews. This was a family
trip and we planned to take the children to a place where they would be able
to enjoy. Since the busy school schedules often bore the children, we planned
to take them to somewhere and let them enjoy their time. As part of the plan
we left home early in the morning and spent almost the entire day there.

Since there were many teenagers and children with us, we had to look after
them. I managed the tickets, purchased lunch and took care of the children. I
enjoyed 2-3 rides and mostly took photos of me parents with the kids.

In the noon I planned to have a bath in the swimming pool and I really enjoyed
that. We also enjoyed a 3D movie in the park and after I won a doll in the
balloon game, I shouted like a 10 years old child. That was a refreshing
gathering for us and I enjoyed both the company of my family members and the
nice environments and amusement facility of this park.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a village or urban area you have visited.

**You should say:**

  * Where it is
  * When &amp; how you went there
  * Who live there

And explain what you liked or disliked about this village or urban area.

**Model Answer:**  
Though I have been born and raised in a metropolitan city, I visited my
grandfather’s house many times and that’s a beautiful village that I have ever
seen. This village is in the north part of the country and falls under the _….
(…Say a division or state or country name…)_. This village is situated beside
the _(…say a river name...)_ and has more than 10 thousand inhabitants.

I went there in my childhood with my parents and the latest visit was in the
last January with my mother. This village is almost 125 kilometers away from
the place we currently live in. First we took a train to reach the station of
the district/state/ country where my grandfather’s village is and from the
station we took a taxi to reach the river port of our village. There we took a
boat and finally we walked 1-2 kilometers to reach the village.

My grandfather has passed away few years back and my grandmother, 2 of my
uncles 2 aunts and their children still live in this village. Apart from our
family members, the farmers and workers who work for my uncles, live there.

This is in my opinion is the most beautiful village I have ever been to. My
forefather lived there and my father spent his childhood and teenage there. So
in terms of bonding, this is a very important place for me. My grandmother and
some of the cousins are very fond of me and I mostly meet them in whenever I
go there. So in terms of my relation to my origin and relatives, this is the
village I admire most.

Besides that, this is a very beautiful village that seems like a painting by a
famous painter. The environment is calm and pollution free, the green fields,
fresh air and hygienic foods offer a very attractive reason for being there.
The flowing river, the forest, the simple live and my relatives are the min
things I love about this village.

There are very few things that I dislike about this village and the village
itself has nothing to do about it. Like the education facility and treatment
facility of this village is very poor and primitive. That’s something bothers
me a lot.

##  Describe a meal you recently had out of your home.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * When you had it
  * Who was with you

and explain why you took it out of your home.

**Model Answer:**  
Recently I ate buffet at City Night Restaurant with my friends. I had this
meal about two weeks ago and we ate buffet in the evening time. That was
actually a get together short of party with my school friends whom I have not
met for a long in person. Over the phone we talked and planned to have a meal
cum get together party together to discuss about us and to meet those friends
in person. We picked the City Night Restaurant because it is in a suitable
location for all of us and we knew the food quality of this restaurant was
good.

We met at around 5 pm and we spent some good time together. Lots of things
have changes and some of our friends have done many challenging things and we
all enjoyed the stories and updated we gave each other. Four friends of mine
from school came to this occasion and they were James, Jessica, Harper and
Patrick_ (...or say names of your friends...)_

It was a gathering we had been planning for a long and as part of our meeting
we planned to have a great feast. From the very beginning we planned to have
met in a restaurant and not at home. Usually arranging get together type party
at a restaurant is easier and more convenient than arranging it at home. No
one feels shy or uneasy being at other's home and the host does not have to go
through a big preparation. The friends who came at this gathering also liked
the environment and foods of City Night Restaurant and that was the main
reason we planned to have it outside our home.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your favourite singer.

**You should say:**

  * Who is s/he
  * What type of songs s/he sings
  * What types of people listen to her/ his songs

And explain why s/he is your favourite singer.

**Model Answer:**  
Bryan Adams is my favourite singer and I like his songs very much. His full
name is Bryan Guy Adams and he was born around 1959 in Canada. Besides his
identity as a singer, he is also a producer, actor, activist and photographer.  
  
He is a very successful and renowned singer around the world for the last
three decades. Though rock music lovers mostly like his songs, a vast number
of people whose first preference of music falls in other categories, also like
him a lot. He is mainly a vocalist and song player but he can play a number of
musical instruments including guitar, piano, bass guitar, harmonica and dobro.
He is basically a rock singer and undoubtedly he is one of the best rock
singers over a long time.  
  
His music touches the hearts of millions of people around the world and though
he is mainly a rock singer, he has fans of different ages and of different
music choices. His vocal, musical performance and lyrics makes his an enviable
and admirable singer.  
  
I like him mostly because of his distinguishable and remarkable vocal. He is
the leader of rock songs of his time. The lyrics and music are extraordinary
and whenever I listen to his songs, it gives me sensational feelings. Many of
his songs have become parts of my life and memory. He is such a singer who can
amuse me with most of his songs. Because of the rich lyrics and pleasant
voice, he has become my most favourite singer.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

###  Describe a time when you helped someone.

**You should say:**

  * who you helped and why
  * how you helped this person
  * what the result was

and explain how you felt about helping this person.

**Model Answer:**  
Thank you for giving me the chance to talk about this topic. Actually I can
remember quite a few occasions when I tried to raise my helping hands for
others. The particular event that I would like to talk about was the time when
I helped a poor family in our hometown during my college years.

I can’t recall the exact name of the person but I remember that he had a
family of 5 members and he was a technician. He had very little education and
he mostly relied on the small shop he had to repair electronic goods. After a
devastating cyclone, his small shop was demolished and he had no other income
source or ability to rebuild it. One day I noticed him trying to console his
small kids who were demanding for foods. This happened near our college campus
and I had been there to meet a friend. I was so touched by the beautiful yet
gloomy faced kids that I went ahead and talk to this person. He explained what
happened and was talking in a trembling voice. He also told me he assured her
wife that he would feed the kids and would bring foods to home.

I bought them some snacks and fruits and asked them to stay nearby for a
while. I watched the small kids were eating the foods voraciously and they had
smiles on their face. I went to my class and told the whole story to my three
close friends. Finally we went to our class teacher and wrote an application
regarding the suffering of the person and his family. The teacher permitted us
to spend an hour to raise some money for the suffering family from other
classes and we were so glad to have the permission.  
We had been able to convey the sufferings of this person and his family to the
students and teachers and we raised a significant amount of money which was
beyond my expectation. With this money we bought some foods and clothes for
this family and they were so grateful that the husband and wife started crying
and praying for us. We gave the man the remaining amount and he had been able
to start his work again.

About my feelings, I was very satisfied and contended. This is the first time
I realized how enthralling and satisfying it is to help someone. I felt like
blessed and the person and his wife revered me as if I was their dear one. In
fact being able to help someone in need is something we can only feel and
words can’t actually describe it.

that takes place in your city.

**You should say:**

  * when the event takes place
  * why it takes place
  * what people do

and explain why the event is special.

**Sample Answer:**  
I come from Taipei Taiwan and one of the most celebrated festivals in my city
is Taiwan Lantern Festival. This is an annual festival that takes place on the
fifteenth day of the first month in the lunar calendar we have.

This festival is hosted by the Tourism Bureau of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications in Taiwan.  Initially it used to be
celebrated in Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park in Taipei but for many years it is
a widely celebrated festival in our city as well as in the whole country. The
main purpose of this festival was to spread the traditional folklore festival
in the country but now it has become a major festival that people
spontaneously participate and enjoy.

People celebrate every bit of this festival. They light over thousands of sky
lanterns. They gather together under the sky, cheers, congratulate each other
and light the lantern. The belief behind the festival is to ward off evil
spirit and malicious diseases from the town. Releasing the sky lanterns is
considered to make the town safe. Interestingly the lanterns are decorated
with wishes and images relating the lantern owner. After releasing the
lanterns people look up at the sky and cheers with joys.

This celebration of one of the major parts of our culture and history and
that’s why it is very significant for Taiwanese. Believes have been formulated
that the festival has spiritual importance to keep the tow safe from diseases
and evils. Considering these fact it is no doubt a major and revered festival
in our city.

to-try&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a job that you would like to try.

**You should say:**

  * what the job is
  * what skills are necessary to do this job
  * is it a good job in your country?

and explain why you would like to work in this job.

**Model Answer:**  
One of my passions from my teenage was to be an explorer, many people like
Steve Austin, Bear Grills etc. really inspires me.  The way they explore new
places, forests, remote islands, they hunt food, they illustrate survival
skills techniques etc. are simply amazing.  I spend hours watching them on TV
and YouTube.

Though it is not a well known profession, I think it will need education on
nature and environment and biology and botany I guess? But the basic skill
would be your knowledge on tackling those situations you are in.  Like how to
get away with the dangers you may face during the exploration like wild
animals, poisoned plants and all. It’s fun to watch but quite intimidating
when you are in there!! I remember an episode of survivor series by Bear
Grills where he had to drink his own urine to survive, from dehydration in a
desert, then one place where he had see off a grizzly in an open place, may be
you might run out of panic in that situation, but you could deal it well if
you know how to and with your presence of mind.  It’s full of thrill!!  Such
kind of situations really arouse me!! It’s my passion and dream to have such a
job. This offers the opportunity to live the life to its fullest.

But unfortunately in India, my home country, such a profession doesn’t exist!
I never heard of any Indian explorer of such kind. A wild life photography
would be the closest profession practiced in India to this. It is not popular
in our country and there is little chance that it would become popular in the
near future. To grade it good or bad- it’s really difficult due to this. Again
compared to an engineer or a doctor no one would appreciate such a profession
in India except people like me who have a passion to explore.

I love to be an explorer as I said before, one reason I guess is that it is a
job that satisfies my quest or hunger to explore.  I really enjoy seeing
myself in such sought of situations, adventure really thrills me, may be its
innate in my DNA?

-major-influence-on-you&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

###  Describe a book or movie that had a major influence on you.

**You should say:**

  * what is it and who wrote/produced it
  * how you learned about it
  * what's the main story of the book/ movie

and how it had a major influence on you.

**Model Answer: **  
So, today I’m going to talk about a book that has had a major influence on me.
I will first tell you the name of the book, then I’ll tell you how I heard
about it, next I’ll outline the main story and finally I will explain why it
plays an important role in my life.

The book is called ‘**Tracks**’, and it is by an Australian woman called
**Robyn Davidson**.  It’s quite old now, I think it was written in about 1980,
but it has recently been made into a film, so perhaps you will have heard of
it.

I was introduced to the book by an Australian friend.  She was traveling in
England when I met her, and we were both working at the same place.  I said
how brave she was going round the world, and how much I’d like to do it but I
didn’t have the skills and courage to do the same.  She insisted that bravery
doesn’t really come into it, sometimes you just have to go.  When she left to
continue on her travels she gave me a copy of this book, with an inscription
that was taken from its last chapter which basically says, the hardest part of
any endeavour (or journey) is taking the first step, making the decision to
go, and after that it’s easy!

The book is a true account of a young woman who decides to cross the Great
Australian Desert on her own by camel!  That is some 1700 miles of Australian
outback, from Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean.  What I found remarkable
about the tale, is that the woman who does this is herself not that well
equipped.  She makes lots of mistakes, things go wrong, she loses confidence
at times, and it is by no means easy.  At the start of the journey she’d never
met a camel, let alone knew about how to work with them!  However, she
overcame all these obstacles through tenacity and creativity and achieved her
goal.  It was precisely because she was apparently so unsuited to the
endeavour that I found it really inspirational to read.  Sometimes you read
tales of adventurers and the people who do great thing seem to be super-human,
incredibly resourceful, strong or wealthy and you end up thinking ‘that’s
amazing, but I could never do that’. With Robyn’s tale it is different, you
think ‘well if she can I could too.  It won’t be easy, but it isn’t
necessarily impossible either’.

So why is the book so important to me?  Because it gave me a nudge to do
something I’d been wanting to do for a very long time.  To travel.  The story
inspired me, but also the confidence that my friend had in me that I could do
it too helped me to eventually take the decision to go off exploring the
world.  Perhaps not anything quite so remarkable as crossing a desert on my
own apart from a few camels, but my own adventures nevertheless.  Since then
I’ve found out for myself that it is indeed true, the hardest bit about any
adventure is making the decision to take the first step.  I wouldn’t say that
after that it is necessarily easy, but I would say if you keep going forward
you won’t want to look back!

going-to&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

###  Describe a restaurant you enjoyed going to.

**You should say:**

  * where the restaurant was
  * who you went with
  * what type of food you ate in this restaurant

and explain why you thought the restaurant was good.

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer:**  
I do not dine in a restaurant very frequently. In fact I prefer to eat
homemade foods. However, there are some occasions when I prefer meeting people
at a restaurant and like to taste the delicious menus the restaurants offer.
One such restaurant is ‘Plaza de Capita Foods’ that I really like and I would
like to thank you for the opportunity to talk about my favourite restaurant
that I enjoyed going to.

I went to this restaurant a couple of weeks ago with my parents and siblings.
The restaurant is situated in a large shopping mall in the city we live in and
it is almost 30 minutes away from our home. The restaurant is in the 18th
floor and offers a nice open sky view.

It was my younger sister’s birthday and we planned prior to the occasion to
celebrate this special day outside. As part of our whole day plan, we ate the
dinner at this restaurant. My father also like the way the restaurant offers
an excellent dining experience in a moderately cheap price.

We ate the buffet and that included almost 40 items in total. I remember
eating around 8-9 items while my parents less. But my younger brother John
enjoyed more than 20 items. Side note: He did not eat all the items. He just
tasted many of them!

The common items we ate included fried rice, sandwiches, fried chicken, curry
chicken, cheese and onion rolls, seafood platter, garlic bread, prawns and ice
cream. The restaurant offers an excellent view as well as a nice decoration.
It was a perfect place to enjoy our dinner and they offered a free birthday
cake! I loved the way they served the foods and the overall price was
reasonable. It was my younger sister’s birthday and the dinner could not have
been better!

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

**_Restaurants:_**

Q. Why do you think people go to restaurants when they want to celebrate
something?

Q. Which are more popular in your country: fast food restaurants or
traditional restaurants? Why do you think that is?

Q. Some people say that food in an expensive restaurant is always better than
food in a cheap restaurant – would you agree?

**_Producing Food:  _**

Q. Do you think there will be a greater choice of food available in shops in
the future, or will there be less choice?

Q. What effects has modern technology had on the way food is produced?

Q. How important is it for a country to be able to grow all the food it needs,
without importing any from other countries?

visit&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

###  Describe a website you often visit.

**You should say:**

  * What website it is
  * why and how long have you been using it
  * what the website is about

and explain why you often visit this website.

**Model Answer: **  
I am going to tell you about a website that I visit frequently.  I will tell
you the name of the website, how long I’ve been using it, something about the
content of the website and I’ll try to explain why it is I keep going back to
look at it.

The website is called workaway, and the URL of this website is
http://www.workaway.info

I haven’t been using the website for all that long.  I think I found it just
by accident, about three years ago, but once I knew it existed I started
looking at it more and more.  
The website is really just a portal, which puts potential ‘hosts’ from all
around the world, in touch with potential ‘volunteers’ who might also live
anywhere across the globe.  On their website they say that they exist to
promote fair exchange between budget travellers, language learners or culture
seekers and families, individuals or organizations who are looking for help
with a range of varied and interesting activities, and indeed that is what
they do.  The basic principle is that ‘hosts’ are organisations or people who
need help with some task, they will provide food, accommodation and cultural
exchange in return for up to five hours work a day from a willing ‘volunteer’.
The ’work’ might be helping with animals, tourists, gardening, language
learning or anything else, and the opportunities are in every country
imaginable.  I have seem opportunities to teach English in Thailand; work with
Camels in the desert and help at seaside Bed &amp; Breakfast establishments in
Brighton England.

‘Hosts’ put up a profile introducing themselves and explaining what help they
need and what sort of accommodation they offer in exchange.  Sometimes it is
quite impressive – your own en-suite room in a hotel, other times it might be
just a patch of land on which to pitch a tent whilst helping establish a new
yoga eco-community!  There really does seem to be something for everyone.
People who have already volunteered with a particular host will sometimes
leave reviews to say what it was like working and living there.  Usually a
host will also put up some photos so you can see the location and understand a
bit more about the people you might be living and working with.

If you are interested in volunteering you can look at all the opportunities
without registering on the site.  However, if you actually want to contact a
host and ask about volunteering then you have to register and set up your own
profile outlining your skills, experience and travel plans.  It only costs
about 20 Euros for two years membership of the site, so I think that’s good
value.You have to be a little careful as some of the ‘opportunities’ seem like
they might just be hosts looking for free labour, but then again, if you want
to travel and you don’t mind hard work then it could be worth it for a couple
of weeks to get to visit somewhere you would otherwise never be able to go!  
I visit the website quite often because I like to imagine all the endless
possibilities for travel and adventure that I might do one day!  I actually
got a job through the website, teaching English in Vietnam and it was a great
adventure.  Now I have ongoing wanderlust, and I like to keep plotting for my
next trip!  Workaway keeps that dream alive.

I went to visit Germany two years ago and stayed at Stuttgart for couple of
days. The Gerber shopping mall caught my eyes with its excellent design and
next evening I went to shop there with two of my friends. This shopping mall
was located near the Stadtmitte and it had more than 100 shops and
restaurants.

People reach this shopping mall using their private cars, local buses and many
people who lived nearby went there on foot. I was living nearby and that’s why
I went to this shopping mall on foot.

There were many shops to visit and the store concept of the mall was very
lofty. It has different renowned brands with rich shopping items. Among
renowned brands it had H&amp;M, ELB, Brandy Melville, Urban Outfitters, Vans,
Kayak etc.

After our 3-4 ours stay there, we bought few items including t-shirts, Jeans
pant, coffee and a pair of shoes. I liked the admirable design concept of the
shops and I really enjoyed my shopping there. The prices were moderate and the
environment was very clean and it gave us a light open airy feelings. I
notices security personnel quite often and that was assuring to have a good
shopping experience there. There was a grocery shop where I noticed a lot of
people were shopping. My experience in this shopping mall was quite pleasant
and that’s why I would say that the Gerber shopping mall would an excellent
choice for shopping.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about your favorite photograph.

**You should say:**

  * ** **what is on that photograph
  *  who and why it was taken
  *  how old it is

 and explain why this is your favourite photograph.

**Model Answer:**  
My favourite photograph is the one which hangs in my bedroom that of me and my
entire family - my family which consists of my parents, my kids and my spouse.
This photograph was clicked on the eve of an auspicious festival of India
which goes by the name of Diwali. The photograph was taken around two years
back at our house by a professional photographer we hired from our area.

The reason why I would term this photograph as my favourite is that it is on
this occasion that we all had the opportunity to be in the company of one
another. It is so because I am a working executive who is generally on touring
job and get too little a time to spend with my entire family. However, on this
particular occasion, when this photograph was clicked, fortunately I was
available in my home town to spend the entire weekend in their company.

I like to look at this photograph very often and this gives me a delighted
feeling. This is one of the prominent souvenirs of our family bonding and the
reminder that family comes first. The happy moment of family members and their
smiles on the photo reminds me how blessed and privileged I am to have such a
happy and contented family life.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

###  Describe a trip that you made by public transport.

**You should say:**

  * When and where you went
  * What kind of transport you used
  * How was your trip

and explain why did you choose to use public transport.

**Model Answer:**  
Today I am going to tell you about a trip I made by public transport.  I will
tell you when and where I went, what transport I used, a little about the trip
and why I chose to use public transport.

The trip was made about five weeks ago.  Can you guess where I was going?  I
was leaving my home in Sheffield, England, to come to Vietnam!

To make this journey I had to use lots of different forms of transport.  The
first part was by car – a friend gave me a lift to the coach station.  The
coach I was travelling in went overnight, so it was very late, very cold and
very dark when I arrived at the coach station.  I was glad my friend was with
me.  The coach arrived at midnight, and the driver was tired and a bit cross.
He was quite rude to all the passengers which I and my friend thought was
funny!  My backpack was put in the compartment under the coach, and I climbed
on board.  There were lots of empty seats on the coach, so I sat at the front
and had two all to myself.  I tried to sleep but it was uncomfortable and I
was excited, so I didn’t really get any sleep at all.  The coach stopped a few
times over night so people could get on and off.  At one point the driver
changed, and a new friendlier driver came on board.

Our destination?  It was Heathrow Airport, this is a huge international
airport near to London.  The journey to London took about 6 hours.  I was very
tired when I arrived in the early morning at Heathrow, but I knew that when I
got on my plane, then the next step in my adventure would begin!

Although I do have my own car, I try to use public transport whenever I can.
I think it is better for environment and also less stressful.  However, for
this trip I had no choice.  I was going away for a long time, so I would not
be able to leave my car at the airport for so many months.  I wonder what my
next journey will be?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

###  Describe an interesting story that you heard or read about in the news.

**You should say:**

  * when you heard or read about the story
  * what the story was about
  * why the story was in the news

and explain why you thought the story was interesting.

**Model Answer:**  
Thank you very much to let me talk about this Cue Card topic. The story that I
am going to talk about is a fascinating story on how an eight year’s old kid
saved more than 500 people from possible fatal casualty. I read this story a
year ago in a daily newspaper.

This story was published in a popular newspaper that I used to read every day
at that time and it was featured as a story of bravery and exemplary one.

An eight years old boy was playing with some other kids in the evening near a
rail junction and suddenly noticed that a part of the rail track was severely
damaged. While other kids ignored that and returned to their houses, this
particular boy was different and he went home and persuaded his father that
something bad is going to happen. He came back to the train junction with his
father and took a great deal of hassle to convince the rail officers to
actually go to visit the damage. They officers were reluctant to do so and
thought it was a child’s imagination or lack of comprehension. But the boy was
adamant and with his father they were able to finally convince them that
something terrible might happen if they do not take prompt actions. When all
of them saw the severe damage on the rail track, it was almost the time for a
passenger rail to pass this junction using this particular rail track. It was
evening and very few people were in the station. The railway authority
understood that repairing the harmed rail road was impossible. They
immediately informed the nearby station and warned them so that the train does
not leave that junction.

Next day many rail supervisors and employees visited the place and they were
amazed by the bravery the boy showed to save people from an approaching peril.  
I followed the news story and next day it made the headline of every local
newspaper. As far I remember the boy was given many gifts by the rail
authorities as well as the local administration.

The story was an exemplary one to remind us how a small sacrifice and bravery
can save others. The eight years old boy showed his utmost intelligence,
heroism and prompt actions to save people from unforeseeable dangers. The
event was so touchy that it went viral in a day and that hit the headline of
many newspapers. I did not watch TV that time, but I am sure that was also in
TV news.

From the very nature of this even, we can understand that we revere the good
news and we are not used to bad news only. The great courage of a small kid
saved the lives of many and that was an indeed worth news story to let the
people of the whole country know and feel proud of.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a famous tourist destination in your country.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * what are the main attractions of this place
  * what can someone see/do there

**And say why you would recommend this place to a foreign tourist.**

_[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]_

**Model Answer:**  
If an international tourist has a one day visit to Indonesia, I would
recommend him to see the island of Bali. There are various reasons why s/he
should visit the island, and I will explain in details about it.  
  
Firstly, Bali is a small island, but it has many beautiful scenery places that
people could visit in a day. The island is famous for its' beautiful beaches
such as Kuta, Sanur and Nusa Dua Beach. These beaches are known for their
beautiful white sands along their coast and for their waves as well, as tens
of thousands of tourists from overseas are visiting the island annually. The
location of these beaches is near therefore tourists could visit these beaches
in just half a day.  
  
Secondly, as these beaches are located near to Denpasar, which is the capital
city of Bali, there are many things that tourist could do in the city itself.
After lying down in the beach, people could see some unique entertainments in
the city, such as the traditional Barong and Kecak Dance. These traditional
dances are unique and artistic, because they are the combination of art,
magic, philosophy and religion. And then, there are so many traditional
restaurants in Bali, where tourists could try these culinary places. Bali is
well known for its' pork ribs and fried chicken, and many tourists have
enjoyed these culinary experiences because they are crispy and spicy.  
  
I personally believe that if an international traveler has only a day to see
Indonesia, I would suggest him to visit Bali, as it has a combination of
beautiful landscape, artistic traditional performance and recommended
restaurants which people could visit in a day.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

**Q. What are some famous tourist spots in your country?**  
**Answer:** Although for the last three years I have been living in England, I am originally from Greece and I'm going to tell you about some renowned tourist places in Greece. The most well-known and famous tourist destination in Greece is the Acropolis. It's an area in Athens, the capital city of Greece, with lots of cafeterias, restaurants, souvenir stores and of course on the top of the hill there is the Parthenon, the most important surviving building of Greece. Apart from Athens, Greek islands are a choice for many foreign visitors. Mykonos, Crete, Skiathos and Santorini are some of the most popular places among visiting tourists with thousands of tourists every year, especially in summer. Greek food, sunlight and sea in combination with Greek hospitality make these spots some of the most crowded and desirable places for the visitors all over the world. 

**Q. What are the positive impacts of tourism in your country?**  
Answer: First of all, tourism is an essential sector of a country's economy.
As far as my country is concerned, tourism provides employment for many people
and those earning members contribute towards the development of our country.
Furthermore, as visitors spend money on different things and activities, the
whole economy is developed and it leads to increasing prosperity. Furthermore,
different types of facilities that are mainly constructed for visitors, such
as airports, hotels and hospitals, are also beneficial to the locals. Finally,
tourism in Greece helps our own traditions and customs to be well-known among
the people of other nations. I would say tourism in my country is quite
important.

**Q. What are the negative impacts of tourism in your country?**  
**Answer: **Apart from the positive outcomes that my country accrues from tourism, there are some unwanted situations and negative impacts of tourism that cannot be denied. Due to a huge number of tourists, the costs get higher each year and this is serious problem for local people. Increase in prices is considered a serious problem and as a result locals having difficulty meeting their basic daily needs.Going further, dispose of rubbish is another undesirable result because people often throw their garbage wherever they want and the places there become smelly and unhygienic. Moreover, foreign cultures are constantly being exposed to our countrymen and this is a serious threat for our unique traditions and customs. In Greece a common problem of tourism is that excessive drinking habit in such places makes people lose themselves and do unethical and petty things 

**Q. What do you think are the reasons people visit new places?**  
**Answer: **This is an interesting and plausible question. From my point of view, the primary reason why someone visits a new place is to learn about its culture and history. Culture is shaped by a country's history and in this way people are able to learn more about other customs, points of view, values and overall civilization. This helps people to broaden their horizons and also leads them to become more open-minded, accept other's opinion and also encourages tolerance and understanding. Furthermore, it cultivates positive changes in attitude and promotes diversity. A further reason for visiting other countries and new places is holiday. As people want to relax and recharge their stamina, they combine their vacation with travelling and meeting new places and people. Finally, visiting new places is kind of refreshing and attractive. This relieved us from our stress and gives us a fresh start in many cases. 

**Q. What can you tell about the future of tourism industry in your country?**  
**Answer: **This question is both difficult and uncertain. In the present, tourism sector in Greece seems to be an influential and profitable, but as things are becoming worse due to the recent financial crisis, it's really debatable and the situation is constantly deteriorating. As mentioned, especially after the financial crisis that plagues the whole country, income has collapsed and wages have declined and unfortunately it's becoming even worse as time goes by. But, as Greece is a history itself, people are optimistic and they hope that this sector won't face any problems and will continue to attract visitors from all over the world.

important-to-you&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

###  Describe a thing you possess which is important to you.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * what it can do
  * how you use it

**and explain why it is important to you.**

**Model Answer 1:**  
Today I am going to tell you about an item I possess which is important to me.
I will tell you what it is, what it can do, how I use it and why it is
important to me.

The item that is important to me is my laptop!  I am not very knowledgeable
about technology, so I can’t tell you anything about its specifications.
However, I can tell you that it is very light and easy to carry around.  It
has both a keyboard and a touch-screen and since starting my travels it has
become my best friend!

My laptop has all the Microsoft office packages like Word and Power Point, it
also has a big memory and can give me access to Skype and the Internet. I use
my laptop every day for work.  It helps me professionally in my job as an
English teacher because I can use it to devise lesson plans; carry out
research on new topics; and keep up to date with news and issues of relevance
to my area of work.  I also use my laptop every day for personal things.  I
can contact my friends by email; chat to others using Skype – if there is a
strong enough wi-fi connection – and I can save all my photos of this
beautiful country that I am working in at the moment Vietnam, safely on my
computer.

I am from England, before I came to Vietnam my employer said it would be
really helpful if I could bring a laptop with me.  I was worried - ‘what if it
gets broken’ or ‘what if it gets stolen’ I thought.  Now I am here I am so
happy I brought it with me.  It helps me professionally to do my job well, and
it helps me personally as I can communicate with friends, family and
colleagues all over the world.

Did you know that when I was in my twenties computers and the internet did not
even exist?  I would never have imagined that thirty years later this gadget
‘a laptop’ has become so important to me.  I wonder what gadgets will be
invented in the next thirty years!

know&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

###  Describe a popular teacher that you know.

**You should say:**

  * what this teacher looks like.
  * what sort of person this teacher is
  * what this teacher helped you to learn

and explain why this teacher is popular.

**Sample Answer:**  
Mr. Jonathon Lee is a very famous teacher whom I know personally. He was our
Math teacher in our college and he is still teaching Mathematics in a famous
college in our country.

He was a tall man with an athletic built and his complexion was very fair. He
had a strong feature in his look and had an amiable yet strong personality. He
was very careless about his dresses and used powerful eyeglasses.

He is a polite person when you are polite with him. If you behave roughly, he
won’t tolerate. He was such a person. I have never seen him to lose his
composure and patience to a nice person. He had a very good way to teach and
we liked him very much for his excellent teaching style. He was a fan of
Football and we often saw him playing football in the morning.

I liked him because he was a reliable persons and a good mentor. I often
struggled to understand the Linear Algebra and Geometry. He spent a great deal
of time to explain the intricacies of these questions and amazingly I scored
very high in my final term in Mathematics. I also learned how to be a good
chess player from him.

You can understand such a good person would naturally be revered and loved by
the students and their parents. And I can’t remember a single student who did
not like him. Because of his strong personality, amiable behabiour, excellent
teaching style and extracurricular activities he became a famous teacher in
our hometown. However, after I left college I heard that he was writing a book
on Mathematics. After few years I have seen his picture in the newspaper as he
was nominated as the ‘Best Teacher of the year’ in our State.

**You should say:**

  * which kind of television programme it is

  * why you enjoy watching the television programme

and explain why you would recommend the television programme to other people.

**Sample Answer: **  
Ultimate Explorer is the TV show I regularly watch. It is indeed one of my all
time favourite TV show.  This is a documentary type TV show which is hosted by
Lisa Ling and in it explorers all around the world visits locations with
unique events and fascinating news stories. This TV show is funded by National
Geographic Society and done in the style of National Geographic

This is a weekly TV series of short documentary and gives a great chance to
learn about the explorer and their fascinating journey around the world.
Nowadays a news-style journal format is used instead of the more traditional
format of the specials than the past.The host investigates a very interesting
topic and thought provoking real events and then explains the details of it.
This news style stories are presented as an excellent documentary and it
ranges from revealing the black market business of Rhino horns till traffic
dealing.

The presentation of this documentary and news story is pretty exciting. Every
episode comes with suspension and thrilling news story. The show reveals many
unknown corners a perspective of life, wildlife, politics and other
interesting topics. This is a fast paces TV show that can glue the TV viewer
in his sofa.

Definitely I would recommend this TV program to other people. It is a must
watch programme that would not only enhance our knowledge but also gives us
plenty of thought provoking issues. Once someone will start watching it, he
will become a fan of this show.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

###  Describe a job you are interested in.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * what you will need to do
  * how demanding it is

and explain why you are interested in this job.

**Model Answer: **  
Today I am going to talk about the job I would like to do for my future career
and I am very much interested in.  I will tell you what the job is, what it
involves and why I’d like to do it. The career I hope to have in the future i
that of an interpreter

An interpreter is someone who is fluent in at least two languages.  It is
their job to help people communicate with one another, even though they do not
have a common language.  The interpreter converts spoken language from one
language to another.  To do this job well involves listening to, understanding
and memorising content in the original language, then reproducing statements,
questions and speeches in a different language.  I think the job would be very
difficult, but very interesting to do.

The reason I have chosen this job is because I think I have the skills to help
me to do it well.  I am studying Business English at university, and although
I am not yet fluent in two language, I think I will be by the time I graduate.
My first language is Vietnamese, and my second language is English.  I am also
studying Japanese, but I do not think I will be good enough at that to offer
it as another language for some time yet!  In addition, I really enjoy meeting
new people, I am interested in their opinions and ideas.  Really, I am quite
nosy, so I find it fascinating listening to what people have to say.  I also
enjoy helping people, so it would be important to me to communicate really
accurately what individuals are trying to say to one another to help them work
together effectively. Though this is not a mainstream and high paid job, it is
nevertheless demanding. This job offers an excellent opportunity to enhance
the knowledge and skill that would be helpful for the rest of the life.

I am really interested in this job because it will allow me to work using my
English language skills, and I love to speak English.  In addition, it may
give me opportunities to travel, or to work in a multi-national company where
I will meet new people from all over the world, and learn about their cultures
and experiences.  I also think if I am good enough at my job, I will get the
opportunity to develop a good career which is well paid, enjoyable and
interesting.

I know I will have to work very hard to achieve my goal but I think it will be
worth it in the end!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

###  Describe a job you dream to have in the future.

**You should say:**

  * what the job is
  * what responsibilities it has
  * what you like about this job

and explain why this is your dream job.

**Model Answer: **  
Today I am going to talk about the job I would like to do in the future.  I
will tell you what the job is, what it involves and why I’d like to do it –
‘though maybe not for ever!  
The job I would like to do in the future is that of a Flight Attendant.  The
job role is also sometimes known as ‘air cabin crew’ or ‘air steward’, but
they all they do the same thing.

The job of a flight attendant is basically to help passengers when they are
flying.  If you have ever travelled by plane, perhaps you think all they do is
serve food and drinks.  In fact they have an important job.  They have to
provide excellent customer service in cramped conditions and are also
responsible for keeping all the passengers comfortableand safe.  Most are
trained to give first aid, and if there was to be an emergency or security
risk, they are the people who would help to get everybody safely off the
plane.  Many people who fly take no notice of the emergency briefing at the
start of a flight, but fortunately air cabin crew practise emergency
evacuation procedures so they would know what to do and be able to take charge
if anything should go wrong.

Although from the outside it can look glamorous, the work of a flight
attendant is actually really hard.  For a start, you might have to work shifts
and really anti-social hours.  You also have to deal with a wide range of
people.  Sometimes people who are flying are nervous about their journey, and
then they can be a bit bad-tempered.  Occasionally passengers will drink too
much free alcohol and that can make them behave badly too, particularly as at
altitude alcohol has a stronger affect. Even so, however tired you are, and
however rude the passengers might be, a good flight attendant has to smile and
just ‘keep calm and carry on!’

The reason I would like to do this job, even though it is hard, is because I
am studying languages.  I would really like to be able to use my language
skills in my job.  Working as a member of the air cabin crew I would meet
people from lots of different countries, and I would be able to use my
language skills.  I would particularly like to work on long-haul flights, and
then I would get the opportunity to spend time in parts of the world that I
could not otherwise afford to visit.  If you do a long-haul flight, you get to
take your rest breaks in different countries.  I think that would be really
exciting.  I also think it would be great fun to work as part of a small team
of other flight attendants.  It helps that I enjoy working with customers too.
I take a pride in delivering good service in my current part time job as a
shop assistant, it gives me great job-satisfaction when a customer thanks me
for my help.  I expect it would be the same job satisfaction if a passenger
thanked me for my help after a long or difficult flight.

The job of flight attendant is not very well paid, and working strange shifts
would be difficult to do for a very long time.  So perhaps it is a job I would
only do for a short while, to gain experience, and travel the world.  Later
on, I might use that experience to help me get a job, perhaps as a tour
manager… but that’s another story!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

###  Describe an interesting place that you have visited as a tourist.

**You should say:**

  * where this place is
  * why you went there
  * what you did there

and explain why you thought this place was interesting.

**Model Answer: **  
Chinatown in Singapore is one of the most interesting places I have ever
visited as a tourist. I have never been to China but Singapore’s Chinatown
gave me a pretty good idea about this unseen country.

Chinatown is located within the larger district of Outram and the name was
given by the British and is still used by the people. This place features the
distinctive ethnical and cultural Chinese and it historically concentrates
ethnical Chinese population.

I went to Singapore as a tourist and visiting Chinatown was scheduled by our
travel company. It was probably early December 2012 when we visited the
Chinatown.  
As a tourist I explored as much area as possible of this region, I ate
authentic Chinese foods, I visited Chinese Heritage Centre and saw the
impressive and beautiful Sri Mariamman Hindu temple &amp; Buddha Tooth Relic
temple. I visited many mom-and-pop and traditional shops, bought some
interesting stuffs and talked to some local shop owners and sales persons.

The whole area was very attractive and interesting in my taste. I felt like I
was witnessing something I have never seen existed. The street architecture of
building, shop houses, painted ladies and the people gave me a totally
different experience. I have tasted a whole different Chinese menu that I have
never eaten.  Trengganu Street, Pagoda Street and Temple Street are some
examples of unique and traditional architecture that was quite fascinating.

I stayed there for about 2 days and these 48 hours of time gave me a quite new
and enthralling experience. I think this place was very interesting and quite
distinctive in my experience.

me. She was only 3 years senior to me and yet she was the mother, mentor and
best buddy to me. I am quite unlucky that I lost her 5 years ago when she died
in a car accident and that was the most devastating moment in my life. She
will be my guide and inspiration for the rest of my life though she is not
around.

I knew her my whole life. I still miss her in every passing second. I wish I
could turn back to the past and meet her once again. My mother was a doctor
and her profession demanded her to work long hours. My father worked in a
foreign multinational company and stayed more than 7 months away from home in
a typical year. To me, my sister was the world I knew. She taught me how to
walk, how to read, how to swim, how to behave and even how to cherish life. I
will never find a friend and counselor like her and that’s why she had and
still has the most important influence in my life.

I remember an event when I was late to return home as I was playing with my
friends in a nearby park and all of a sudden a ferocious storm started. I was
shocked and numbed and then I noticed my sister was running fast towards the
park in this devastating weather to save me. She indeed saved me many times:
sometimes from a storm, sometimes from a depressive and gloomy experience and
sometimes from my own evil side. Thus her influence was most significant in my
life.

I feel so brokenhearted not to have her near me. I would have been a much
happier person if she was still alive. I wish I could be as strong she was in
my tough days.  I always pray to the Almighty so that she rests in peace and
we can meet again someday.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a thing you bought, that you had to save money for.

**You should say:**

  *  what it was
  *  how long you saved money for it
  *  how you saved the money

and explain how you felt after you bought it.

**Model Answer:**  
There were a lot of things that I had to save money for, but the one that I
can remember very clearly was my first laptop. It was ten years ago when I was
in the first year of university. I wanted to buy a laptop for my study;
however, my parents would only pay for a desk computer, which was much cheaper
at the time. So I had to save up the gap between a PC and a laptop, which was
a huge gap for a uni student.

But I was determined to save up for my laptop, so I started to work part time
as a private English tutor for high school students. The hourly rate was
generous, but because I only had 2 students, I was not able to save up as
quickly as I wished. Because I lived in the campus, so I could not cut down my
accommodation cost. Instead, I cut my food spending, so for a few months, I
did not have proper dinner.

I felt like I had done everything I can to save up as quickly as possible, but
in the end, it still took me almost a year. Because I had put so much effort
in it, I felt incredibly proud when I finally had my laptop in my hands.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a person who is special or means a lot to you.

**You should say:**

  *  how you meet him/her
  *  describe this person
  *  what you usually do together

and explain why this person is special to you.

**Model Answer:**  
One of the special persons for me would be my wife. I met my wife in church in
year 2000. We were Sunday school teachers back then, but we taught different
classes. I was teaching in the 5th and 6th grade class, while she was teaching
in the middle classes, which were the 3rd and 4th grade. During our Sunday
school teaching era, there was a gathering, and I happened to be in the same
group with her, and from there we started to have lots of conversation
together and we make phone call every day.

My wife is a kind and friendly woman, as she likes to talk and make friend
with many people. She likes travelling a lot, therefore she was a former crew
member of a local airlines here in Indonesia. She had worked for about 10
years in the Company, but unfortunately the Company was broke and decided to
shut down the Airline. Besides travelling, my wife also has a passion in
beauty and fashion as well, therefore she is planning to enroll in a Beauty
and Make Up class in the future.

There are a lot of things that we usually do together as a family. On the
weekend, we usually go to the gym together. I like jogging in the treadmill
while she prefers to exercise with the static bicycle. And we usually exercise
for about one or two hours. And then both of us are movie lovers, therefore we
like going to the Cinema together. We usually do it for about once or twice in
a month, since we have a child these days, but before that, we routinely
watched movies for about once or twice in a week. And lastly, we enjoy raising
our child together, as we love little children. I believe that having a child
for a young couple like us is just like being given the greatest gift in our
lives.

She has a special place in my heart. I love her because she knows me better
than anyone else in the world. She is a compassionate woman and loves me a
lot. We spent time together, we share everything and she will be there for me
no matter what. For the love I feel for her and the way she loves me makes her
the special person of my life who means a lot to me indeed.

visited&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an unusual building you have visited.

**You should say:**

  * where it is
  * how it looks like
  * why you went there

**and explain why you think it was unusual.**

**Model Answer 1: **  
Buildings are strange things, they are easy to take for granted if they are
the ones you live near to and pass by every day, but some buildings are really
remarkable, and not always for outwardly obvious reasons.  It would be easy to
pick an ‘unusual’ building that has an extraordinary external architecture,
and of course they can be remarkable, impressive and on occasion beautiful.
However, the building I want to talk about is certainly unusual, unique even,
but you wouldn’t necessarily know this unless you went inside.

So I’ll tell you where it is and what it looks like, why I went there, and
explain what it is that makes it so rare.

The building is in Sheffield where I live.  It is a large tower block and as
well as being the second tallest building in the city I am told it is the
tallest university building in the UK.  It is known as The Arts Tower, because
those are the subjects that were originally taught inside its four walls.
Degrees like modern languages, philosophy and other Humanities disciplines.
It is a classic 60’s tower, twenty stories high and constructed of concrete
and glass.  Honestly, it’s not particularly attractive - not in my eyes
anyway, though it is typical of that era in architectural terms.  Even so, it
is something of a local landmark, because it is so high you can see it from
almost anywhere in the city.  It has so many glass windows that in certain
lights the building seems to change colour as they reflect the light of the
skies outside.  It can look like burnished gold in sunset, or in the dark,
when the internal lights are on, it is lit up like a Christmas Tree.  I
wouldn’t call it beautiful, but it is striking.  However, these factors,
‘though ‘interesting’, aren’t what make the building so unusual.  The reason I
made a special visit to see inside it, is because of what lies within…

The building was constructed with a really rare and unusual elevator.  It’s
called a Paternoster Lift, and before I moved to Sheffield I’d never even
heard of one.  They are a little tricky to describe, but I’ll have a go!
Essentially, a paternoster lift is a passenger elevator which consists of a
chain of open compartments (each usually designed for two persons) that move
slowly in a loop up and down inside a building without stopping. Passengers
can step on or off at any floor they like, but the lift just keeps moving so
they have to be quick!  There are no sliding doors to shut you in the
elevator, you just step in the opening and stand in it until it reaches the
floor you want, when you carefully step out as the chain of ‘boxes’ just
carries on in slow but continuous motion.  The design is pretty ancient, going
back to the 1880s, so at the time they were first created they must have
seemed extraordinarily innovative, but now the lift is unusual because it is
such historic engineering.  Very few of the lifts survive because of safety
concerns - the continuous motion and open ‘doors’ means people can fall going
in and out, and a few years ago someone was actually killed using one getting
caught in the mechanism somehow as the compartment they were in transitioned
from going up one side to going down in the loop the other at the top of the
lift.  Sheffield, however, has kept its paternoster lift and kept it in
working order too.  I think it might be the largest one in the world, at 38
separate compartments (or maybe they should be called carriages), but it is
definitely the largest in the UK.

I made a special visit to the building to try out the lift with a friend.  In
such a technological age where we take things like escalators – even flying
for granted, it was a strangely unsettling experience.  It actually took a
little while to pluck up the courage to step into the moving platform as it
passes by as you have to time your entrance quite carefully.  Similarly, you
need to judge it carefully getting off, too slow and there isn’t time to jump
before you are taken off to the next floor, too fast and you might bump your
head as the opening isn’t quite clear.  There is a definite knack to it!  It
was like traveling back in time, you could imagine people in Victorian times
in England being astonished at such extraordinary technology, it is impressive
now – it must have been mind-blowing then!

So I think this building is unusual, because it contains a piece of living
history.  A working paternoster lift that is possibly unique in size, and
certainly extremely rare.  The building also has a couple of conventional
elevators now, as well as stairs for people to use.  However, the paternoster
lift is still there, turning slowly, and it is quite fun to have a ride, like
traveling back in time on an ancient fairground ride!  The building is also a
rather literal reminder that you shouldn’t make assumptions only by what is
most obvious – you just wouldn’t know from the unpromising exterior of the
Arts Tower what lies within!  Sometimes if you look beneath the surface a
little very remarkable things emerge.  Hence the saying ‘don’t judge a book by
its cover!’

**Model Answer 2: **  
A curved building, a gigantic animal shape in front of a building, crazy arts
etc. are quite magnificent architectural examples I have witnessed many times
in my life. But nothing can be as unusual or unique than the ‘Basket Building’
I have seen in Ohio, United States.

This building is the head-quarter of the Longaberger Company and this is a
famous manufacturer and distributor of handcrafted maple wood baskets and
other home and lifestyle products in the United States. This giant basket
building is situated in Dresden, Ohio in the United States. One of my maternal
uncle lives in Ohio and I went to visit his house two years back. While
visiting different places with my cousins I noticed this building and the
exceptional and strange design of this building simply stunned me.

This building is a giant basket like building. It might give you the
impression that a picnic basket has been kept in the side of a park. The idea
of establishing a building that represents the corporate brand and the main
product the company manufactures was indeed a genius one. It is a 7-story
large building which is the head-quarter of the Longaberger's Home Office.
This is perhaps the largest basket monument human has ever created. I heard
from my cousin that it is around 200 feet long and 136 feet wide. After I
returned home and search for more information about this building and found
some interesting facts like, it took more than 2 years to be completed and it
cost 30 million dollar. It occupies more than 25 acres area and the basket
handles were settled on the top of this building using 150 tons weight copper
and wooden rivets.

As I told that, my concept of strange building and monument was redefined
after I saw this building. It was quite unique, some would say bizarre.  I
think this is the strangest building I have ever seen because of its
architectural design and structure. Anyone who has never seen this building
would be puzzled and would agree that this is a strangely designed and unusual
looking building.

###  Some other unusual buildings you can talk about:

  * Dancing House (Prague, Czech Republic ).
  * Habitat 67 (Montreal, Canada).
  * Forest Spiral - Hundertwasser Building (Darmstadt, Germany).
  * The Torre Galatea Figueras (Spain).
  * Stone House (Guimarães, Portugal).
  * Cubic Houses (Rotterdam, Netherlands).
  * Wooden Gagster House (Archangelsk, Russia).
  * Manchester Civil Justice Centre (United Kingdom).
  * Beijing National Stadium (Beijing, China).
  * The Ufo House (Sanjhih, Taiwan).
  * Nord LB building (Hannover, Germany)
  * Kansas City Public Library (Missouri, United States).
  * Grand Lisboa (Macao).
  * Container City (London, United Kingdom).
  * Nakagin Capsule Tower (Tokyo, Japan).
  * Wall House, Groningen (Netherlands).

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a teacher from your past that you remember.

**You should say:**

  * what class the teacher taught you
  * how old you were then
  * what the teacher’s special qualities and characteristics were

**and explain why you still remember this teacher.**

_[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]_

**Model Answer: **  
I remember Mr. Stuart who was an extraordinary teacher in my grade 7. He
taught us Botany when I was in grade 7. I was then around 11 years old.

He was a remarkable teacher in terms of his teaching style and personality. He
was quite elegant and distinctive in his dressing style and had a very
charming and smiling face. While most of the other teachers sparked their
tough personality, Mr. Stuart was very friendly and amiable. He was very
punctual about the classes and I have never seen him missed a class! He
reached the classrooms 5 minutes prior to the schedule and waited for the
clock to tick the hours. He then recapped the lessons he taught last day and
then asked us to question him. Only then he moved on to the new lectures. He
told us lots of stories and those were all related to our study. He had been a
successful teacher to reach the heart of the students. While we hated some of
our teachers for their personality sometimes, I don’t think there was a single
student in our class who did not love Mr. Stuart.

Botany was not a subject I had interest in at that time. I was quite sure I
might get the lowest number in this subject. However, this particular teacher
and his brilliant way of teaching made me interested in this subject. I
remember him because he was a good person, an excellent story teller and an
ideal teacher for us. Because of his influence in the classroom, most of us
did exceptionally well in this subject. I still think that we need more
teachers like him in our schools who would be close friends to the students as
well as great teachers and mentors.

####  Rounding off questions:

Q. Do you want to be a teacher someday?

Q. Why do we remember some people differently than others?

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What kind of person makes a good teacher?

Q. Why people choose to become teachers?

Q. Do you think education will change in the future? How?

Q. How does technology affect education?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a thing / subject that you want to learn more about.

**You should say:**

  * what it was
  * how you got interested about it
  * what the benefits you get from it

and explain why you want to learn more about it.

**Sample Answer:**  
I learned the Spanish language in my early school years and then moved to a
different country with my parents. In three years I learned the very basic if
this language and I am very much enthusiastic to enhance my proficiency in it.
In fact Spanish was my second language in my schools and I spent many hours
studying and practicing it not only to get a good grade on exam but also to
actually know this language.

I did not have any alternative but to take part in the Spanish classes during
my school days. However, in few days I found it very fascinating. I started
spending time to learn more about this language and my mother bought me a
story book written in Spanish. I was determined to be able to read it. That’s
how I started to learn it. I had a moderate skill on handing the basic
conversation and writing in Spanish. But a long time since then had passed and
I never practiced it later on.

Learning a language is always helpful in terms of better understanding of
their culture, tradition. It has other benefits like better migration and job
aspects. I have few friends from Europe and they are my fiends only because I
could speak Spanish. I had also been able to read few books and magazines
written in Spanish language and I enjoyed reading them thoroughly. I had twice
been in Spain and I found the language knowledge very handy.

Main reason I want to learn about it because I have a passion and enthusiasm
to be able to speak Spanish fluently. My childhood memory is connected with it
and I don’t want to miss any chance to revere my childhood memories.

Apart from that, being able to speak Spanish would be an excellent chance for
me to meet new people and read many new books. It would also be helpful to get
some privileges to get a better job in a large multinational organization.
Considering all of this fact, I am very much eager to further learn it.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a project or a piece of work you did together with someone.

**You should say:**

  * what it was
  * what you have done
  * why you have chosen this person to work with

and explain what you did to finish the project.

**Model Answer:**  
Currently I am a student at University and we have to do group assignments and
presentations. I would like to tell you about the group assignment that I have
done with one of my friends from the University.  
  
Last semester we had a course on Company Law and one of the assessments was an
assignment. We have a case law and we needed to prepare an ILAC (Issue, Law,
Application and Conclusion) for this case.  
  
When we have to do a group work, usually I am a person who starts to do it. I
try to prepare a draft that we might read, check and change some information
later after when I complete this first draft. Also, at the same time, my
friend also prepares his draft in order to have some information to compare.  
  
I choose this person because he also studies very well at University. Both we
are doing the same degree and the same majors (accounting and finance). I
believe that it is important to cooperate with people with the same goals that
you have in order to maximize your chances for success. Additionally, I
respect this person and value him as a good friend and good student. One of
the most important things why I cooperated with this particular student is
that he is very supportive, intelligent, a person who I can rely on and he can
add value to me as I am trying to add value to him and work as a team.

achieved&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an ambition you have not yet achieved.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * how long you have it
  * what you have to do to achieve it

**and explain why it is important to you to achieve it.**

**Sample Answer: **  
My plan to settle and work in a first world country is yet to be achieved.
This is an ambition and plan I have for a long. After I got admitted in the
university, I had some double about my major which is social science. To be
honest I was bit frustrated not to study either in Engineering or in Medicine.
However, in few months I started loving this subject I was studying and
started feeling the immense possibility this might have in my future. That I
time I considered settling in a first world country for the higher study and
work.

To be more precise, I have this ambition for the last 5 years. This ambition
started forming in my head when I was in the second term in my university
which would be around June 2011.

First of all, I need a really impressive result in my Masters Degree program
so that I can get a scholarship in a reputed university. The admission in a
top rated university in a first world country would be the first step to
fulfill my ambition. Then I would need to study and research really hard to
have a prominent presence there so that I can get a decent job offer. My
dedication, determination and hard work would be the vital factors for
achieving this ambition.

This is very important for me to work and settle in a first world country.
First of all I have a fascination about researching in my study field and I am
sure that would be better facilitated in a first world country. The career
prospect and research facilities in my country is not that promising and I
have an aspiration to contribute to a great extent in the arena I have my
knowledge. Considering all these, it’s really important for me to achieve my
ambition.

####  Rounding off questions:

Q. Is it important for us to have ambitions?

Q. Will it be easy for you to achieve the ambition you talked about?

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. What are the important qualities to achieve our ambitions?

Q. Are all ambitions good in life?

Q. What type of ambitions young generation in your country has?

Q. Would you focus more on achieving your ambition or doing things you love to
do?

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 366 - Describe an educational television program.

program&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an educational television program.

**You should say:**

  * what it was
  * on which channel it was telecasted
  * what you learned from it

and explain why you think it was a good educational program.

**Model Answer: **  
I am incredibly lucky, because I live in the UK, and we have the BBC – British
Broadcasting Company, which is funded by a licence fee payable by all British
households, companies and organisations.  As such, it has a particular public
service broadcasting remit, it isn’t funded by advertising, and is expected to
produce quality, unbiased factual and ‘public interest’ material.  Amongst
other things, it has an educational responsibility as part of its remit.
Perhaps because of this, the BBC is renowned worldwide for the quality of some
of its programmes.  In particular, its wildlife broadcasting is breathtakingly
good.

It happens, that only today I watched the most amazing wildlife documentary,
I’m going to tell you all about.  What it was on, what channel it was
broadcast on and what I learned from it.  I think it will be pretty obvious
why it is so brilliant – not just in worthy educational terms, but as
extraordinary visual entertainment too.

The programme was just one of a whole series called ‘The Hunt’.  Each episode
concentrates on a different part of the natural world, taking an intimate and
detailed look at the remarkable strategies employed by hunters to catch their
prey and what the hunted have to do to escape.  Today’s episode was called,
‘Hunger at sea’ and was about the oceans.  Amongst other things, the team had
spent years trying to get footage of remarkable marine animals including blue
whales – which are the heaviest animal ever to have existed on our planet
(it’s 30 metres long, and they weigh appreciably more than even the largest of
known dinosaurs), but can still be elusive in the vast expanse of the seas.
However, the programme looked at lots of different creatures as well as the
blue whales.  There was film of sharks, sea lions, frigatebirds, dolphins and
albatrosses cleverly revealing the strategies they use to hunt for prey in the
big blue waters of the oceans.  I don’t live near the sea so whilst I know
it’s beautiful and I worry a lot about pollution impacting on it, I don’t get
to see if very often.  This programme demonstrated that the open ocean is an
immense wilderness that covers more than half the surface of our planet, yet
for the most part it's a watery desert, largely devoid of life.  It is a
fragile ecosystem, and predators face an endless search to find and catch
food, yet these great tracts of ocean are home to some of the most remarkable
hunters on the planet.

The production values of the series were beyond your wildest imaginings.  The
film footage is remarkable.  It took two years, but a team of scientists and
underwater photographers eventually got footage not only of a blue whale – a
rare enough achievement in itself, but a blue whale feeding on a massive ball
of krill, gulping in water and the tiny zooplankton creatures all at once.  It
was really extraordinary to see.   The programme series is being narrated by
Dir David Attenborough – he is a well-respected broadcaster and scientist who
delivers interesting information with passion and clarity.  The photography
though is just amazing.  Close up shots of these extraordinary creatures in
their natural habitat, the tenacity and dedication of the production teams in
obtaining such footage can only be imagined.  The programme is currently on
BBC1, but I’m sure it will end up being broadcast worldwide as well.

I learned so much about marine life, ecosystems and how so many animals
survival is interconnected.  It makes me sad that our oceans are being
polluted and fish stocks over-fished, but I take hope that such extraordinary
television programmes might help raise awareness about the complexity and
fragility of life in the seas.  The programme gave a glimpse of an underwater
world that would be otherwise impossible to sea, it not only increased my
knowledge, but the footage obtained is of scientific importance too, because
they were able to capture on film animal behaviour that has never been
recorded before.  That’s quite something.  I think this programme series The
Hunt, is well deserving of the accolade of a brilliant education TV programme
on natural history.  If you get the chance to see it, do so!

##  Describe a gift you have received that was important to you.

**You should say:**

  * who gave it to you and for what occasion
  * what it looks like
  * how you use it

and explain why it is important to you.

**Model Answer: **  
On my 24rd birthday my uncle game me a laptop as a birthday gift and this was
one of the best gifts I have ever received. My uncle, Mr. Roger, was a
prominent businessman and had a partnership business with my father. I was
very fond of him and he usually gives me utilitarian and expensive gifts. On
my 24st birthday he gave me a Dell laptop and indeed it was an important and
inspiring gift for me. It was about a year ago and the laptop is still in good
shape. I had very basic knowledge on computers and after I got this laptop
from my uncle, I learned many things and I am still learning and that is very
important for my higher studies as well as my career I presume.

This laptop was a black colour thin laptop with 16 inch display. It was less
than a Kilo and I carry it in my bag and often use it in my bed as well as in
my study table. I usually spend 2-3 hours daily on my laptop and that is very
helpful for me to learn the graphics designing and Auto CAD software I am
currently working on. I connect to the internet using this laptop and I can
communicate with my friends and relatives easily.

This gift is very important for me. It was a present from a person whom I like
very much as well as it gives me opportunity to communicate and learn new
things. In today’s world the knowledge of computing is really vital and that’s
why it is an important gift for me.

####  Rounding off questions:

Q. Why do we like receiving gifts?

Q. Can we sometimes hate a gift?

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

**_Let’s consider first of all how people’s values have changed._**

Q. Do you enjoy giving and receiving gifts? Why or why not?

Q. Who usually gives you gifts?

Q. Who do you give gifts to?

Q. In your country when do people usually give gifts?

Q. What kinds of gifts do they give?

Q. Do you think gift-giving customs are different now than they were in the

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a subject you would study that you never had the opportunity to
study.

**You should say:**

  * what is it
  * what this subject deals with
  * what benefits you would get

and explain why want to study this subject.  


**Model Answer: **  
In my childhood my aim was to become a renowned doctor but due to rise in
merit list for admission I could not get entry in to a medical college. I got
admission in Bachelor in Pharmacy and now I am working as a Pharmacist.  I
would love to study Medical books, more specifically Psychiatry, if I get an
opportunity.

Psychiatry is very vast subject. It is not only the knowledge of mental
illness, it highlights how we can enhance our intellectual capabilities.
Variation in mood put strong impact on personality and business. In my opinion
in modern age every person has some symptoms of psychiatric illness. If we
have brief knowledge of these attitudes we can manage the people who are
having bad attitudes and they are working in our surroundings. New subject of
psychiatry is Emotion control, it emphasize who we can make our self   happy
and relaxed by just keeping our brain cool.

Another aspect of this study will be early prevention and diagnosis. If we
detect psychiatric disease at the time of its start then the result of its
cure will be great. Mental illness destroys the families and economics of the
patients. By preventing these diseases before commencement we can improve the
society and don’t let any disaster to happen. In short, brain controls all the
activities of body and emotion control the brain. The Psychiatrist controls
the whole human machinery by just controlling the emotions. Considering the
advantages the knowledge this subject offers, I would love to study it with
passion and great interest.

##  Describe a magazine that you often read.

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * What type of people read it
  * Is it popular in your country?

Explain why it is important to you to read it.  


**Model Answer: **  
The magazine I often read is "Medical Technology". People who are medical
laboratory technicians love to read this magazine. It's a monthly magazine. It
is quite popular in Hong Kong. Almost every registered medical laboratory
technician read this magazine regularly.  
  
The magazine not only offers the basic knowledge in how to process human
samples accurately, but also publishes the latest news regarding to new
technologies. I have gained a lot of knowledge by reading this magazine. For
example, I didn't know how to identify white cells under microscope. After
reading the magazine in 2013, I found it was not a problem for me to identify
different kinds of white cells during work. Also, the magazine helps me catch
up with the new technology. In February, I read that people in the University
of New Castle invented a new technology to do mitochondrial donation. All the
information in the magazines is useful for my work. I can broaden my eyes, and
improve my skills quickly.

Oh no, this is a great topic to talk about and it is slightly embarrassing to
describe!  You ask how old I was when I got lost, as if this is something that
can only happen to you as a child.  Unfortunately the example I am thinking
about is rather more recent.  I’ll try and explain what happened, where – I
will tell you how old I was if you like, and I’ll certainly describe what it
felt like too.

So, the situation was just a couple of months ago.  I’ve fairly recently taken
up a new hobby of running.  I’m not very good at it, I’m very slow, and I just
like to use it as a way to see interesting and beautiful scenery.  I prefer
running trails, that is going cross country, rather than running on roads, but
that can be a problem as you need to be able to navigate, and I’m not very
good at that either!  I heard about a fell race that was taking place a short
drive away from where I live.  It was a 5 mile route across open countryside,
such events usually use footpaths and some trails, but there is a risk you can
lose your way.  Because I’d never done anything like this before I emailed the
organisers in advance.  I explained I was worried about getting lost and that
I was also very slow, so I didn’t want to find myself stuck out on the open
moor when night fell!  I got a lovely reply.  The organiser assured me that
she herself could ‘get lost going upstairs in my own house’ so she had
personally put out really clear markers along the whole route.  What’s more,
there would be a back-marker bringing up the rear.  ‘Honestly’ she said ‘there
is really no way you can get lost or come last, I promise!’  Can you guess
what happened?

The day of the event dawned.  Everyone took off, and after the first couple of
miles I found I was running alone.  All the faster runners had sprinted off
out of sight.  I wasn’t last, I could at first hear the back-marker laughing
and joking with some really slow runners at the back – one of whom had to go
extra steady because of a heart condition.  The course was well-marked, and I
enjoyed running through woodland, lolloping through fields and even along a
few country paths.  Towards the end of the race I entered a thick patch of
trees.  The marker flags turned off sharply to the right and I followed them –
straight to the banks of a stream.  I was really confused, the path just ended
at the water.  I went on for a bit, but no more way markers or signs, I stared
at the water again.  I retraced my steps, but the signs were really clear.
Then I had a ‘lightbulb’ moment, I suddenly realised this was a fell race so
it was designed to be challenging.  I ‘obviously’ had to just wade across the
stream to the other side, and so I did.  Only to end up in really thick
bracken and bramble undergrowth.  There was no path there.  I was so confused,
I crossed back over the river, and repeatedly checked for signs, but I just
couldn’t find the route.  In the end I double backed about half a mile to try
and find the backmarker, but they had vanished too.  After about 10 minutes
(though it felt like much longer) I found a different way out of the woods,
and saw the race finish.  Everyone was there waiting for me in a bit of a
panic, as they couldn’t work out how the backmarker (who was supposed to come
in last to make sure everyone had finished safely) had somehow come back
before me.  Because we all had numbers, they had realised that I was still out
on the course but they couldn’t work out where I could possibly be.  I ran
back rather lopsidedly, and soaking wet from having waded back and forth
across the stream countless times.  Breathless at the end I explained that I
was sure I’d followed the path correctly yet somehow I had achieved the
impossible thing of both getting lost AND finishing last!  It didn’t make any
sense…

The organisers couldn’t understand it, they went back into the woods to see
what had happened.  It turned out that some vandals had set a false trail in
the woods.  The other runners had all been in sight of someone in front so
hadn’t really been looking at the markers, only following the person in front.
The back marker was local and knew the way, so she too hadn’t needed to check
the route either.  Hence, it was only me that got caught out.  How unlucky!
So how old was I, well fifty – you apparently don’t have to be a child in a
fairy tale to get lost in the woods!  As to how I felt, well initially
confused, a little alarmed and then embarrassed as I couldn’t work out how it
happened.  Once there was an explanation I felt a bit better.  The event
organisers were lovely and friendly and very concerned that his had happened –
but it wasn’t their fault, it was just one of those unlucky things. However,
once it was all over, I thought it was hilarious.  No one was hurt, and in a
funny way it boosted my confidence because the two things I’d dreaded most had
happened, and actually, it didn’t matter one bit!  Even so, next time, I think
I’ll look at the intended route more carefully on a map before setting off!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a paid job you did or someone you know did.

**You should say:**

  * what the job was
  * how you/this person found this job
  * how long you/ this person had this job

and explain how you/ this person feel(s) about this job.

**Sample Answer:**  
Thanks for the opportunity you gave me to talk about this topic. Actually I am
doing my post graduation in a university now and I worked in a local Web
design and Hosting company for about one year after I finished my graduation.
I would like to talk about this job experience I have.  In fact this is the
only paid job I have ever done so far.

I joined this company as a junior executive and when I left the job I was
working as an Executive officer. As the company business was related to
website designing, hosting and networking related services and I was an
executive there but not a designer or programmer, my main responsibility was
to promote their services, managing existing clients and giving some technical
feedbacks over phone and email.

I learned about this job from an online job portal and their advertisement
stated that fresh graduates could apply. I went through their other job
requirements and it was a good match for me. I applied online and in a few
days I was called for the interview. After two weeks they gave me a call and
asked me whether I wanted to join their company or not. I accepted their offer
and joined this company in earlier January, 2014.

I did this job for about a year as I remember leaving this job in the early
February of 2015. After I got enrolled in my MBA, I found it very difficult to
manage my time both for the office and classes. I had to decide and I
preferred to pay full attention on my studies and left the job.

My experience in this company was very pleasant. In deed I learned a lot about
the client communicating, handling their queries and complaints, promoting
different packages this web hosting company offered and the technologies
related to the designing and hosting. Besides, I was lucky to work with some
great colleagues including many designers, developers and system
administrators. The working environment was very friendly and I never felt
stresses working there. The professional knowledge and experience I gained
from my first job in this company would be very important in my career, I
hope.

I had to work many long hours and that’s something I often had to struggle
with especially after I got enrolled in my Masters degree. I remember working
till mid night sometimes when there were issues related to a server or
hosting. Sometimes deadlines were very frequents for various clients and I had
to work without any day-offs. Apart from these negative aspects, I enjoyed my
job and the salary was very satisfactory. I even got two salary increments in
one year and that was very encouraging for me.

##  Describe an old person you admire.

**You should say:**

  * who this person is
  * where did you meet with him
  * what characteristics you most like on him

**and explain why you admire this person.**

**Model Answer: **  
The old person I admire most is my grandfather. To me he is a hero, an ideal
father, a benevolent person and a man of his honour. His name is Alexander
Vladimish and he is around 75 years old now.

We live in a joint family and he is still the head of our family. Though he
can’t manage every aspect of our family due to his age, yet he is still the
decision maker for our family. I remember him from my early childhood when he
used to play chess with me. He taught me many things including the value of
honestly and punctuality. He bestowed me some of his great adventures in his
life through stories and those stories are still inspiring for me.

He is a person of his word. He would not talk much but when he does it carries
unparallel weights. He is a benevolent person as I have seen him helping many
people in our locality. He was an educated person and a successful father as
all of them are successful professionals and businessmen now. I revere my
grandparents for his acute observation and great decisions. I like his so much
that I want to become a person like him.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a cafe/restaurant you have recently visited.

**You should say:**

  * where it is
  * why you went there
  * what you ate or drank

and explain why you liked or disliked this cafe or restaurant.

###  Sample Answer:

I went to a café about two weeks ago to attend a birthday celebration of one
of my colleagues and this was a unique place that caught my eyes. The name of
this café is ‘Café Metro’ and it’s near the City centre shopping mall. I was
bit inquisitive about the birthday celebration in a café. But after I reached
there, I found out it was quite a large place and in fact had much more
facilities than a conventional party centre.  I once heard about this café but
never went there as it is located far away from my house and office.

It was Thursday evening when one of my colleagues reminded me the birthday
invitation of Mike. I went in the café with 3-4 colleagues and before reaching
there we bought a gift for Mike.

There were about 30 people in total and most of them were my colleagues. I
wished Mike a happy birthday and gave the present we bought. I sat on a corner
and enjoyed the soft music that was playing. A piece of birthday cake was
served and it was the first thing I ate there. After that I drank a glass of
water. I was then asked whether I would like to join the supper of wait a
while. I had to get back home early that day and that’s why instead of a
dinner, I preferred to eat my supper. But to my amazement more than 20 items
were served which were white heavy for the evening meal. However, I ate the
soup first and then went for the traditional Italian item called primo. Then I
ate antipasto before I ate the dessert. There were probably more items in the
supper but I was full and did not eat anything further.

I would say I had a very delightful experience in this café. The environment
was quite unique with gorgeous painting and decoration. The spacious café
offered an excellent experience that made me like this place very much. The
food items were delicious and the service boys were very friendly and amiable.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something interesting you learnt from the internet.

**You should say:**

  * what you learnt
  * what website you learnt it from
  * how you learnt it

**and explain why you think it was interesting.**

**Sample Answer: **  
I am a regular internet user. It would not be an exaggeration if I say that I
am a technophile and a netizen. On an average I spend around 10-12 hours
online due to my profession in software development and personal interest. I
run two blogs: one personal and another one on technology and this increase
the amount of time I spent online. In fact I learn so many things every day
during my internet surfing. For this topic I would talk about a really
interesting thing that I learned many years ago which is related to human
interaction on search results in famous search engines like Google and Bing.

The term is commonly called Golden triangle that represents the human eye hit
maps on the search results. The search engines like Google and Bing and also
Yandex and Baidu are market leaders. They serve an unbelievable amount of data
to internet searchers and lots of research are conducted to present the most
relevant and accurate data to the searchers.

The golden triangle is the hit map of human eye activity on the search engine
result pages and this looks like the English alphabet “F”. This means all the
search engine users look more on the upper-left corner of the screen and then
on the right side. The eye hit map presents that the search results that are
placed on the top (upper-left) have a better chance to be noticed by the
searchers and thus get more traffic.

I was reading an online article by one of the prominent online research
websites and that article particularly caught my eyes. This was actually a 6-7
page article and the illustration and data was so interesting that I could not
leave my desk until I finished the whole article. To dig further I read some
other relevant articles and blog posts and the whole idea of researching user
interactivity while searching was fascinating.

The search engines are the doorway to the internet and according to a recent
statistics Google alone gets more than 200 million searches every day. Since
traffic driving and doing well with websites and online business rely heavily
on search engines, I often read articles and research papers about search
engine optimization. This article gave me a good insight on human interaction
on the screen and thus helped me think in a different way to implement my
efforts to help clients get better position in search engines. So I would say
that was a really fascinating thing to learn.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an important event in your life.

**You should say:**

  * what is it
  * how old you were then
  * wat happened

and explain why this was an important event in your life.

**Model Answer: **  
Well, I have so many important events in my life and I can remember many of
them. However, I would like to talk about the most auspicious ceremony of my
life, my marriage, which happened in December 2012.

When I got married, I was 26 years old. Since I belong to a traditional and
orthodox Hindu family, it's more or less like a religious and family festival.
We invited most of our friends and relatives and the celebrations started
three days prior to the event. We had to arrange all the amenities to the
guests who came by; such as hotels to stay, food and drinking arrangements and
we had to make sure all of them were pretty satisfied. However another biggest
challenge I faced was the raising of fund for the occasion. Fortunately
everything went well and the day is still a wonderful experience to think
about.

On the flip side, the greatest reason why that day is rather important is
because, ever since then, I witnessed a dramatic change in the way I live. I
had to become more responsible and after all, I got someone to share my life
together. I gradually realized, the biggest part in life, is to become
shoulders and shade, to someone who is important to us, especially at the time
of crisis. I would like to conclude by saying that now I am happily living
with my parents, wife and son, and my marriage was the first significant step
towards this journey.

but the most vibrant and colourful place in my opinion is Vernazza which is
small town in northwestern Italy. I still feel the animated landscape and
bright scenic beauty I witnessed there. This place was so coulourful that
every photo we took there later on looked like a beautiful postcard.  Lemon
yellow, pastel pink and sea green façades dot the coastline of Vernazza and
the four other scenic waterfront villages that made up Cinque Terre was
something I will never forget. I have never seen such beauty in colours and I
can compare it only with the colours of garden full of flowers and
butterflies.

I went to Vernazza as part of our tour plan to visit the famous tourist
destinations in Italy. We had an initial plan to stay there for few hours but
the loveliness of Vernazza simply took our heart away and we stayed there
couple of days.

Most significant thing I did there was appreciating the beauty and rich
colourfulness of this place. I ate my lunch and dinner in a local restaurant
and had a boat trip in the evening. We did fishing as it is one of the truest
fishing villages on the Italian Riviera. I also visited Doria Castle, Chapel
of Santa Marta and   Vernazza's beach.

It would be quite hard to express the beauty and vibrant colours of this town.
Lively mixtures of colours were everywhere. The houses were coloured in red,
yellow, pink, green and lemon-yellow while the water around the town was deep
blue. In the hilly area there were green trees and flowers of different
colours. The boats in the bay and water were coloured with all the colours of
rainbow, the skies was deep blue.  I have never seen any place as colourful as
this town was.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about an equipment of your household (computer, television,
refrigerator, mobile phone as so on).

**You should say:**

  * What is it
  * What you do with it
  * Will you always keep it

and explain why it is important for you.

**Model Answer: **  
I am describing my laptop as it is the equipment I often use at home. It is a
black coloured laptop by Toshiba brand and I bought it almost five years ago.

This electronic device has helped me in many aspects, including work, study
and communication. The first important usage is saving data. I can save
numerous e-books, pictures, audio and video clips in it, and the 300GB
hardware capacity has allowed me to save plenty of them. Moreover, I can
access the Internet using this laptop. By connecting to the Internet I can
access every website, check my email and watch online movies or documentaries,
like National Geographic documentaries, which has extremely been useful to
improve my listening and speaking.

Lastly, definitely this device has been very useful to my profession. By its
camera, I can save many important information related to my job and use them
as I need to access them in few seconds. So, this laptop has assisted me to
raise my knowledge not only in my career and study, but in learning English
language.  
I have already become dependent on my laptop. May be I will replace it with a
new one but a laptop would always be mandatory for me.

I rely on my laptop for my personal, professional and study needs. I
communicate others with laptop and this is the primary means of communication
with my friends. Definitely the use of internet and computer has become
unavoidable in this modern era and this is indeed a very important tool for
me.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an indoor game that you enjoyed as a child.

**You should say:**

  * what the game was
  * where you played it
  * who played this game with you

and explain why you enjoyed playing this game.

**Model Answer 1: **  
I haven’t thought about this in years.  Erm, I did play games inside quite a
lot as a child, everything from board games like snakes and ladders to hide
and seek, but that was when I was a bit older.  However, I think probably one
of my favourite games – or things to play with at least – was when I was
really little.  Maybe about four?  Let me tell you all about it.

The game involved playing with a set of simple, pale wooden bricks.  I’d had
these for as long as I could remember, there were maybe fifty or so
differently sized rectangular (cuboid) and square (cube) blocks of wood, and
they were stored in a dark green canvas duffle bag which had a white rope
handle.  I don’t know what the wood type was, but it was pale and they were
quite light, so I could manage them even with my tiny hands.  The bricks
provided me with hours of creativity and fun, even though they don’t sound at
all promising.  From an early age, I’d toddle over to the bag, find a spot on
the floor at home, and just upturn all the bricks in a messy pile on the
floor. The ‘game’ was simply to build things.   Sometimes I might make a tower
as high as I could before it toppled over.  Other times I’d create creatures
or whole worlds with different bricks perhaps representing a different
building or animal.  I just used my imagination, the bricks could be
absolutely anything I wanted.

Playing with bricks sounds like it might be a solitary activity.  It’s true,
sometimes I did just play on my own, absorbed in my own thoughts.  However,
sometimes I’d play with my sister too, and together we would create our own
universe which we might control, or at least interact with.  If friends came
around we could work together to construct more complex creations.   A tower
might be built even higher with two minds at work trying to fathom out how to
make it stable.  Or we would develop each other’s ideas in the way that only
small children with boundless imaginations can do.  We had no limits to our
creativity, and we were so small at that age that everything we saw was new
and unexpected, so it was just as easy to imagine a goat as a dinosaur – both
were equally unfamiliar in my world, so why not have dragons and unicorns too?
It is amazing what a little rectangle of wood can represent if you have an
open mind, and believe everything is possible!

Why did I enjoy it?  Thinking back I just remember feeling content and
absorbed with this game.  I suppose when you are so small, maybe four years
old or thereabouts, there isn’t much you get to control in life.  However,
with this game I could do whatever I wanted and in my imagination travel
wherever I pleased.  It was something I could do with other playmates too –
though I wonder how co-operative we really were at that age.  I also can still
remember the sense of satisfaction of building an enormous tower of bricks
that was even taller than me… and then the seemingly endless joy of knocking
it all down again and watching the many bricks scatter across in all
directions!  I don’t think I’ve ever felt quite so powerful since!

I don’t remember exactly what age I was when I outgrew playing with such
simple bricks, but I do feel a bit nostalgic when I look back at that time.
Nowadays children’s construction kits are much more sophisticated, with models
coming with instructions on how they should be built.  I wonder if we have
lost a little there, a construction kit with a picture showing how the
finished model is ‘supposed’ to look, might help you build a replica of an
existing building perhaps, but your imagination might use the same materials
to create a whole new world!  I know which I would prefer to do…

**Model Answer 2: **  
I actually don't play indoor games nowadays because I don't have enough free
time. These days whenever I get free time I like to do reading and cooking.
But I miss my childhood days when playing indoor games were so desirable and
fascinating.

The indoor game that I used to play when I was child was dumb charades! I
played this game with my parents. We used to play this game at weekends
mostly. Especially when my parents had free time as both of them were very
busy with their works.

I enjoyed this game very much because we used to play in 2 teams. One member
of each team has to made different gestures or do some movements and other
team members have to guess it. As child that was a great challenge for me. I
had to make the right gesture to help my partner understand what I was trying
to say. On the other hand we had to perform really good to beat the opponent
team. As I played with my parents and close family members, I loved their
companionship. The game required a bit if psychological effort and
brainstorming while it was so challenging and enthralling.

I really enjoyed this indoor game than any other indoor games I played at that
time.  At the end of each game a chocolate pack was given as a gift and that
made the game more challenging and competitive. Some of my very fond memories
with my family members were rooted in this game. I still remember my mother
making some funny gestures to let my father understand what she was trying to
mean. My mother’s lovely face, funny gesture and loud laughter made me cherish
this game more than any other one. Sometimes it was very relaxing for us to
take part in this game and I guess my parents also liked to play this game
with me as they found that I enjoyed it a lot.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your best friend.

**You should say:**

  * Who is he
  * How long you two are friends
  * What you do together

**And explain why s/he is your best friend. **

**Model Answer: **  
Stuart is undoubtedly my best friend according to every definition I can
fathom about the best buddy! He is 24 years old and a handsome fellow. His
smile (both genuine and rouge one) is worth million dollars! Once I heard that
if you can stay silent for a long time with a friend and yet feel comfortable
being so, probably s/he is your best friend and that’s exactly what Stuart is.

We are friend for more than 7 years and I met him in my college days. After
our friendship began I enjoyed his accompany from every perspective. He
remains stick with me through thick and thin, and is always the one person
whom I can share anything and everything. He is a good listener and one of the
most talented persons I have ever met. He never hesitates to tells me the
truth in an unapologetically blunt manner and never hesitates to stop me when
I am wrong!

Our friendship started and remained so tight mostly because of our common
interest. We often discuss the books we read, criticize the writings or movies
we watch and praise a beautiful piece of artwork. We are both interested in
computer games and we often play computer games together.

These days we are learning Spanish together and taking our graphics designing
course together. Whenever I rent or download a movie, I invite him to watch it
on my 3D TV. Apart from that we are maintaining a blog together and that’s
something we enjoy to a great extent.

Sometimes I share things with him that I cannot share with anyone else, and I
get advice without being judged. This is the best part of our friendship and
probably the main reasons our friendship is still intact and strong. He
celebrates my successes genuinely, we know each other in and out and we can
talk about everything no matter how nonsense it is.

##  Describe a memorable event of your life.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * what happened
  * where you were

**and explain why this is a memorable event. **

**Model Answer: **  
There are several joyful events in my life that I can summon up and among them
I would like to talk about the day that my aunt was blessed with little baby
boy. This was an event that I still recall vibrantly.  
  
My aunt gave birth of the baby in a hospital. When I saw a little prince was
crying on my aunt's lap I was like skimming that time. I was very contented
when I heard my aunt is going to give a birth a baby. I got very animated and
I was counting days when this baby will come. I speculated and anticipated
lots of things I would do with the baby. On the day when baby came into the
world was one of the happiest days of my life.  
  
I usually used to go look after my aunt. After I went to the hospital to see
the price, I was very glad and attached by the event. I heard a baby's crying
voice and then went near the baby. For the first time I felt a strong desire
to kiss and hug him. He was so cute and adorable. He was trying to open his
little eyes. I thanked to god for this precious gift because my uncle and aunt
had no children for many years even after their desperate tries. They gave
birth to the baby after 15 years of their marriage.  
  
My aunt asked me to hold him and kiss him. But I was so afraid to touch him as
I thought that might hurt him. I felt I was in another world that time with
the baby. After spending lots of time my parents were ready to go home but I
denied returning home at night. I stayed in the hospital.  This was a
thrilling event for me.  
  
Now I have great attachment with him. His first word was my name. But that
time he didn't know who exactly he is calling! So this was the event that I
like the most. It gives me lots of happiness and that’s why I cherish this
memory very much.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an interesting phone conversation you had with someone.

**You should say:**

  * when you had this conversation.
  * whom you talked to.
  * what it was about.

**And explain why this conversation was interesting.**

**Model Answer: **  
I had a very interesting phone conversation recently and I would like to talk
about it. It was Sunday and the clock was ticking at around 11.00 am. All of a
sudden I got a phone call and I received it. It was very baffling initially as
I was confused whether it was a recorded message or a real person was talking
over the phone. I stopped the girl who was talking and asked her to talk very
slowly. She was a marketing executing of some sort of electronic consumer
selling office. She told her name Anne and I had real double whether that was
her actual name or not!

She called me to talk about some promotional offers their company had
announced. I told her that I was not interested but she was quite persistent
not to let me drop the phone. I am quite acquitted with annoying marking and
call centre phone calls and the type of scams they are after. I told that girl
I would not be interested to buy anything and then she told me whether I would
be interested to by an electric shaver! That was quite a coincident because I
was indeed in need of it. I was bit confused whether she had any sort of data
about me or not. I asked her to contact me later but she started describing me
the features of their electric shaver!

After few minutes I cut the conversation all of a sudden and she tried to
reach me few more times but I did not pick up her call. So far that must have
been a very typical phone conversation until I got a call from another number
and she told me that she was one of my cousins who pretended to be a sales
girl and talk to me few minutes earlier. I was quite amazed with the type of
fun this cousin did with me. I had not talked to her for many years and that's
why had not the slightest hint about her vocal.  
We later on talked about our work, study and family and she asked me to visit
her hometown someday. The conversation with this cousin (her name is Mirtha),
especially when she pretended to be a sales girl was quite funny and
interesting in my opinion.

figure&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a historical figure.

**You should say:**

  * who he/she is
  * why he/she is famous
  * Do you like him/her or not? Why?

**And briefly explain his/her life.**

**Model Answer: **  
One of the historical figures that I admire the most would be Thomas Alva
Edison. He was an American Inventors who lived in the end of the eighteenth
century. It is said that Edison was one of the greatest inventors in the
world, as he had found more than 1000 inventions during his time.  
  
One of his greatest inventions would be the bulb light that we still use until
today. In his biography, it was told that he had done almost 1000 experiences
for the light and almost failed. But due to his persistence and strong
determination, he finally found the bulb light. He was also the co-founder of
the giant multinational company, General electric, which still exist until
today. But the Company has transformed into a high tech company which sells
various kinds of products these days.  
  
I personally like Edison, because of his great determination. During his time,
scientist had limited equipments, as there was no computer, no calculator and
people have limited access to the library.  But with that limitation, he never
complained and gave up and continued to make some experiments. His story has
motivated so many people all over the world and I believe that we should
continue to pass the story to the young generation.  
  
One of the fascinating things about Edison's life would be when he was a
child. He was dropped out from school because his teacher believed that he was
too stupid to learn. But thankfully he had a kind and loving mother who never
gave up on him. She became Edison's teacher who always supported him in every
situation. And in the end, Edison became one of the greatest inventors in
history.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 391 - Describe a successful company you know

know&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a successful company you know.

**You should say:**

  * what it is about
  * where it is located
  * what it does

**and explain why you think this company is successful. **

**Model Answer: **  
How do you begin to define success?  This is really hard, because does it mean
a company that makes lots of money?  Does it mean a company that produces
something innovative or is just very well known?  Does it mean a company that
makes the world a better place through discovering a medical cure or paying
fair wages to staff in countries where they are often exploited?  I don’t
know, it could mean any or all of the above!  Even so, I can think of one
company that I know well, and which is meaningful to me, and which started
from nothing to become a chain, so I think that makes it more than successful
enough to talk about in my eyes, even though you may never have heard of it.

The company is called Bravissimo.  I used to live in a town called Leamington
Spa, which is in Warwickshire in the UK, and that is where the company started
out, and where its head office is still based.  Essentially, they are ‘just’ a
lingerie retailer i.e. they sell women’s underwear, but what makes them
unusual, is that they cater exclusively for erm, well let’s say, the more
‘curvaceous’ figure.  They sell bras in larger D+ cup sizes.  The company was
born from one woman’s frustration at being unable to find a decent comfortable
and well-fitting bra when her body shape changed during pregnancy.  She and a
friend decided they couldn’t be alone in struggling to get quality lingerie
appropriate for their size, so they went on a small business course, and with
the help of a modest grant set up their own company sourcing and selling
lingerie by mail order.

They really hit on a great idea, there was at that time a definite gap in the
market supplying bras to women with a fuller figure.  The business quickly
took off, they really cared about their product, and they had a local ethos.
Employing local people at their warehouse, and then when they opened their
first shop in Leamington spa they paid good wages and trained staff well.  For
seemingly the first time, women could go to a specialist shop, be measured
without embarrassment by a knowledgeable and sympathetic member of staff and
try on as many bras as they wanted to in an unhurried and relaxed environment.
Speaking as someone who had real difficulty getting underwear that fitted me,
it was just brilliant when they started up.  The week the shop opened I went
in to be measured and came out with a completely different bra size from the
one I’d been wearing before.  I threw away all my old underwear, and for the
first time ever felt comfortable, confident and quite literally supported with
my wonderful new bras!

Unsurprisingly, the company quickly expanded, theynow have 21 stores across
the UK and also sell via mail order and online.  From just the two of them who
started up they now employ over 700 people.  They have also expanded their
range to sell clothing under the Pepperberry brand from 2011. The company is
successful because they had a really good idea, and the tenacity to see it
through.  The founders have expanded carefully, and it is a profitable
business.  I believe because the company was set up by women who had a real
passion for their business, they deliver quality with understanding.  I love
that the entrepreneurs were two women, and they have an attention to detail
which makes for great customer service and generates customer loyalty.  I have
a many friends who, like me, having discovered Bravissimo would now never go
anywhere else.  The company has grown, but the quality and personal service
remains the same as at the outset.

Because the company started from a need and an idea, rather than setting out
to make a fortune, I believe it has an internal integrity.  Many women
customers want to get rid of their old underwear once they have found a size
and product that suits them better.  Therefore, Bravissimo has set up
recycling banks in their shops so bras in good condition, but that no longer
fit their original owner, can be sent to parts of the world where having a bra
is seen as an unaffordable luxury yet is much needed to help protect women and
girls.  It’s hard to imagine from the comfort of the UK, but in some countries
underwear gives protection by demonstrating status and showing that a woman or
girl, must therefore have someone who cares for her and protects her.  Having
a decent bra isn’t just about being more comfortable, it might actually
protect these women from sexual assault – startling, but true.

So I think Bravissimo is successful however you look at it.  It started with a
great idea for a product where there was a gap in the market.  It is good at
what it does, and it provides something that certainly makes my life a lot
easier.  The company is financially profitable, and it employs many people in
good working conditions.  If my memory serves me right I think it may even
have been awarded a prize for being local employer of the year at one time.
It has retained a personal feel.  I know plenty of people who shop online with
them, and yet I’ve never met anyone who has a bad word to say about the
company.  In this day and age that degree of customer loyalty is a rare thing
indeed.  Hurrah for Bravissimo, long may they continue!

like-to-work-with&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a family member you would like to work with.

**You should say:**

  * who this person is
  * what kind of person he or she is
  * whether you have worked together before

**and explain why you would like to work with this person (more than with other members of your family).**

**Model Answer: **  
I am quite proud to have a family where I have got a talented brother, a
renowned architect uncle, a genius sister who is an aspiring programmer and a
father who is my hero in life. So it would be fairly tough to select a single
person from my family with whom I would like to work with. Well, among my
family members I would like to work with my brother David, I presume.

David is senior to me by 3 years and is a really brilliant young person I have
ever met. He is working in a big architect company where he designs modern
houses and building. The main reason I would choose him to work with is
because of my interest in architectural design and my brother’s being a great
mentor.

He is a gifted and hard working person who would someday become a great
architect for sure. He is amiable and friendly. He has always been my
protector and the great teacher in my life. The list would be countless if I
want to mention the things I have learned from him. He is tall and handsome
person and a voracious reader who always reads or works. I sometimes think in
amazement how a single person could be so skilled and well-informed in so many
arenas. Mathematics, physics, sports, history, geography, art, chess,
astronomy, literature… you name it and he is a master in it.

Certainly I have worked with him before, but that was not something
professional, but kind of personal projects. He and I built a remote
controlled boat when I was in the school and I learned how determination can
bring success from the experience I gathered from this project. We failed
several times to build the motor boat out of some ordinary tools and
equipments we had at home. At a time I got depressed but he was so determined
that I could not quite. Apart from that we did many other things together like
participating in charity and voluntary work in our community, building a
flying saucer toy, to solve numerous math problems etc.

Well, the main reason I would like to work with his is because of his patience
and my interest in his profession. He never loses his concentration and
temper. No matter how stupid and wrong I am, he will always guide me to the
right direction. He is talented and I will definitely learn new approaches to
solve a problem. He is a great teacher for me and I am sure there is none with
whom I would be as close as I would be with him. Another important reason I
would like to work with him is because of his work area. As I said he is a
promising architect and I would like to know more about the type of works he
does.

##  Talk about your favourite politician.

**You should say:**

  * who is he/she
  * what he/she did that you can tell others
  * do you want to be like him/her

**and explain why this person is your favourite politician.**

**Model Answer: **  
Usually I don’t like the politicians in our country. If I have to pick one to
talk about I would choose Baburam Bhattarai. From him Nepalese people have
much expectation for the nation’s development. I also have same optimistic
thoughts about him. He came from a small village of Gorkha district and became
prime minister of our country.

In today’s scenario of Nepalese politics he played tremendous role to have an
optimistic road map in front of the Nepalese nation. He is a visionary leader
and a good politician. The contribution he has made towards making our country
a developed one is something worth mentioning. I would very proudly tell
others how he has sacrificed his time and efforts to do the betterment for our
nations especially having a progress roadmap and many implementation of it.

I don’t like politics, at least the money making and power play politics that
we have. I don’t have any desire to be a politician. I believe every citizen
of a country has many things to contribute for the country and I want to do my
best to help the country.

I admire Baburam Bhattarai for his vision and fair play. He is a rare
politician in our country and we need more visionary and honest leader like
him.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a present which you were given and that you broke accidentally.

**You should say:**

  * what is it
  * for what  occasion it was presented to you
  * how you broke it

**how you felt when you broke it.**

**Model Answer: **  
One of my college friends once gave me a fish bowl with 5 gold fishes and that
was an exceptional gift for me. Before that I never had any kind of pet or
aquarium at my home and gradually I started feeling the passion on such kind
of hobbies. I was very sad to have it broken one day all of a sudden. Though I
have bought another one with new fishes, but I still feel bad about my
carelessness to have the fish bowl broken by me.

The fish bowl was given to me by Maria as to congratulate me for being the
highest scorer in Mathematics in the second term exam in our college. She was
the second best scorer!  I was bit confused when she one day gave me the gift.
However, I placed it near my study table and often looked at it. I bought some
colourful stones and fish foods afterward and the fishes became something very
favourite to me. One day I was cleaning my room and don’t know how but I hit
the bowl with a broom and it fell on the floor and was broken completely. The
fishes were scattered in the room and immediately bought a jar and placed them
in it.

I felt very sad about this unexpected incidence. The fishes died in few hours
and that made me even more depressed. The gifts are always inspiring and
though I have brought another fish bowl with new fish, it does not replace the
old one I had.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

**_Famous stores in your country:_**

Q. Tell me about any famous stores that sales presents.

Q. Tell me about any famous markets or stores which attract tourists.

Q. Why are they popular with tourists?

**_Advantages and disadvantages of giving present_**

Q. Would you agree that presents are always advantageous for people?

Q. What kinds of presents are suitable for people in any situations?

Q. How do you think the way of giving presents will change in the future?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your family.

**You should say:**

  * How many family members you have
  * What they do
  * What are they like

**And explain your relationship with them.**

**Model Answer: **  
Thank you for the opportunity your game me to talk about my family. To begin
with, my family has got 6 members including me. My father, mother, my elder
brother and two younger sisters are the center of my world and I love them
very much.

To start with my **mother**, she is the sweetest person and the kindest
hearted woman I have ever seen. She is creative, helpful and loving in nature.
She used to work as a teacher in a college but left it when my elder brother
came to this world. She still runs a small boutique business besides taking
great care of her family.

My **father** is the cornerstone of our family and works hard to win the bread
for our family. He is a great mentor for all of us. He works in a large
private company as a Vice President and he is a super dad, our inspiration and
guide. He cares and loves all of us and holds himself responsible for our
family's well being. He loves travelling and that’s why we have travelled a
lot with him. He is our hero, friend and mentor.

My **elder brother (John)** is an exemplary young person and a son every
parent would dream to have. He is very talented and works in a Bank as a
System Analyst. He has a creative soul and art is his passion despite his
academic background in computer engineering. He is one of the best friends I
have and he is my protector.

My **younger sister (Kathy)** is two years junior to me and she is my soul
mate. She often rivals me but more often inspires me. She is my co-worker in
everything unusual or out-of-the-routine thing I do. Sibling rivalry is
something I have learned from her in a positive way. She would sometime act as
if she is my mother!

The little angel and the only mischievous family member is my **youngest
sister Poly**. She is only 9 years old and she fills our home with her angelic
smile. She is sometimes annoying and argues a lot but I can’t live without
her. Toys, computer games and her pot plants hold her attention for the major
part of the entire day. She loves to grab attention and complains about
everyone just to grab some extra attention and affection.

The famous saying ‘Blood's thicker than water’ is quite true as I feel most
comfortable and blessed being with my family members. I am sure I am lucky to
have such a happy family where everyone has great contribution to help me
become the person I am.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

**_Attitudes to family:_**

Q.  In what ways have families in your country changed in recent years?

Q.  Should husbands and wives have different roles within the family? Why /
why not?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe the colour you like most.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * why you like it
  * how colour are important to costumes

and explain why this is your favourite colour.

**Model Answer: **  
Actually, the most favorable color for me is blue. I love blue color, and I
enjoy wearing blue clothes, or drive blue car. One important reason why I like
this color is that it helps me to feel less stressed. It is the color of sky
and ocean and by looking at it I remember the beauty of the nature.

I think color is a part of cultures, and people can show their common habits
by wearing their popular clothes which have different colors. For example, In
Canada, Canadians are used to wearing red clothes in festivals, or Brazilians
wear yellow color in their national days. Moreover, color can help us to
distinct different careers. Doctors put on white coat, militants wear grey or
nurses the blue one.

From my perspective, I love this color because firstly it helps me to have
better feeling about everything. For instance, when it comes to taking exam as
I wear a blue colored shirt, I can better overcome my anxiety and I have more
confidence. Another reason is that I think it is the only color that helps to
become more patient. Personally, as I use see blue color I can tolerate
difficult situations in my life. So, this color is the best choice for me due
to its quality of increasing my self-confidence and patience to take burden to
difficult conditions.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something a child did that made you laugh.

**You should say:**

  * who the child was
  * when this happened
  * what the child did

**and explain why it was funny and made you laugh.**

**Model Answer: **  
It’s true, children can do the funniest things.  Sometimes it seems a bit
unfair to laugh at their antics, because they are maybe doing exactly what it
is we’d like to be able to do, but unfortunately, as adults, we probably
wouldn’t get away with!   They can have a curiosity about the world that makes
them notice and draw attention to things we probably would politely ignore,
which can be embarrassing, but can be funny too.  However, I have a particular
example in mind.  I’m going to tell you all about it.  I wasn’t even there to
witness it, but it is such a good example that I heard so much about I feel
like I was there, so I’m sure it must count!

The child in question is called Beth, and she is the daughter of a good friend
of mine.  She is grown up now, and at university.  She would hate for me to
remind her of this instance, but it still makes me laugh to recall it.  The
situation was that she had a birthday party aged about six or seven years old
I think.  It was a very special occasion, her mum (my friend) had made a
lovely cake, and all the children at the party were in some sort of fancy
dress – probably as fairies or something similar, in any event it was a very
BIG occasion.  Beth, the little girl, was utterly delighted to find herself
the centre of attention, and enjoyed party food and games, having her friends
around her and no doubt getting lots of presents too!  The only sad thing was
that for some reason, her grandparents weren’t able to go to the party.  To
make sure they didn’t miss out, my friend made a great effort to get hold of a
camcorder (an old fashioned video filming device - modern mobile phones that
you can film with just didn’t exist back then) and recorded the whole occasion
so it could be played back later.

The following weekend, the grandparents gathered at their daughter and
granddaughter’s home and settled down to watch the video together.  The video
was a great success, capturing the sense of occasion wonderfully.  All the
adults oohed and aahed at the film, enjoying reliving the party enormously.
However, after about five minutes, Beth suddenly got really annoyed.  She was
jealous about all the time they were spending watching the television when she
felt they should be spending the time interacting with her!  Apparently she
put on a real strop!  She stomped across the living room and stood directly in
front of the TV screen so no-one could see the picture anymore.  She folded
her arms across her chest and defiantly exclaimed ‘I don’t understand why you
are wasting time watching a picture of me on the television, when I’m the real
me and you could be playing with the real me instead!’

It was hilarious, she was so cross, and so jealous of her own picture.
Everybody laughed.  I did too, when I heard all about it later as my friend
relayed the story to me over the phone.  It is true that Beth, the little girl
was maybe a bit spoilt to expect to always be the centre of attention, and
it’s ironic that she was so annoyed when actually it was a film all about her
celebrating her birthday that they were viewing anyway.  Even so, there is a
little part of me that thinks, funny as the story is, she was right in a way.
Sometimes it is important to live in the moment, and we can spend too much
time seeing life through a viewfinder on a camera or on a TV screen.  What she
did was still funny, it makes me smile now recalling it, and she will still
cringe if we mention it to her now – but there was a lesson in there too
somehow, if we choose to hear it...

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a team you have been part of.

**You should say:**

  * when it was
  * who was on the team
  * what you did together

**and explain why you became part of the team.**

**Model Answer: **  
Nothing is better than being in a really strong team.  By that, I mean one
where everyone achieves more together than would have been possible as
individuals.  You have trust in each other and support each other too.  Sadly,
not all team work is like this, I’m sure it can’t just be me that has had some
bad experiences of working with others when the communication has been
terrible, workload inequitable, the experience miserable and outcomes
disappointing.  However, when everything is right, a good team can make you
feel invincible, and that is the sort of example I’m going to use today!

I’ll tell you all about the team, when we got together, who was on it, what we
did (I don’t think you’ll guess) and why I came to be part of the group in the
first place.

So this team came together just a couple of months ago.  We were a group of
about ten mismatched and unlikely individuals.  We were mixed men and women,
different ethnic backgrounds, different ages, different levels of fitness and
experience – which is relevant to what we were trying to do!  We came together
almost entirely by chance.  Near to where I live there was a 10km obstacle
race. This involves running round a course, and negotiating various physical
challenges en route.  To take part, you need to be in a team, because some of
the obstacles are impossible without help.  So for example, you might all have
to get over a 10 foot wall, or swim across a river.  Sometimes it’s a simple
question of bravado – with the river you just have to be brave enough to jump
into the freezing cold water, but other challenges – like the wall - can’t be
done unless you trust your team mates to push you up and heave you over.
Think army assault course, and you may have some idea of what I mean!  A
friend of mine had heard about a group that was happy to adopt the approach of
‘the more the merrier’ so we all signed up separately and met each other for
the first time on the morning of the race!

When we met up, at first we were all a bit apprehensive about what to expect.
We decided to put on face paint so we had a united identity, and then when the
cry went off for the start, we all sped away together.  Fortunately, we very
quickly got into a routine of helping each other out.  It turns out that doing
a physical obstacle course together not only requires trust, but creates trust
too. You have to clamber over each other, stand on someone’s back to get over
an obstacle, or haul on someone’s hand or arm to help them over in return.  If
you go first over an obstacle, then you have to help others behind you.  We
got covered in mud, we nearly lost our shoes on the uneven terrain, and we all
had many bruises on the way round.  However, we laughed almost the whole time,
we supported and encouraged one another, and even though it took us nearly two
hours to negotiate the whole course, the time flew by.  We can’t wait to do it
all again next year!

I just signed up for the challenge on a whim really, but I was so glad I did.
The people I met were fantastic, and we all achieved more than I’d have
thought possible.  There is no way on earth I’d have got round that course on
my own, but together every single one of us completed every obstacle, there
were no tears or tantrums, and when we got our medal for finishing at the end,
we were almost exploding with pride at our achievement.  Why did I become part
of the team?  That was a question I asked myself as I drove towards the venue
wondering what on earth I’d done as the enormity of the challenge hit me!
Afterwards I was so pleased I had.  It was a happy accident, and proof that
some of the best teams come from working together for a common goal with an
open mind, an open heart and a sense of humour.  I think that would carry you
through most challenges, you just have to keep positive and keep faith in the
creativity and kindness of your fellow human beings!

###  IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.

##  Describe a type of clothes/ dress you like.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * what it looks like
  * how often you wear it

**And explain why you like it so much.**

**Model Answer: **  
Oh dear, this is a challenging one for me.  I don’t really think about clothes
very much, I’m not much of a follower of fashion or a‘clothes horse’ as the
saying goes.  I just like to be comfortable, and inconspicuous.  Hmm, even so,
I’ll think about what I instinctively put on the other day, when I had no
particular obligations that required me to dress in a certain way so I just
put on exactly what I wanted.  There couldn’t be a more accurate way to judge
what I really like to wear than that!

In life, we often have to wear certain things to be acceptable and presentable
in particular situations.  Of course I’d wear a suit if I was going to a job
interview, and I have been known to put on a dress if I was going to a wedding
(though that really isn’t a sight you see very often!)  If I’m going for a
run, I’ll pull on leggings and a sports top, which is really comfy, but not
what I’d wear at home.  I’m going to tell you what I wear by choice, what it
looks like, how often I wear it and why I like to so much.

I think I must be a bit of an odd shape, because I find it really hard to get
clothes that fit me well.  I’m quite short, and a bit top heavy, so things
that fit the top of my body can swamp my lower half, so I always prefer to
wear a separate top and bottom rather than a dress say.  If I’m having an at-
home day (that is, a day when no-one will see me and be horrified at how
informally I’ve dressed) then I’ll go for what is most comfortable every time.
My flat can be really cold, especially at this time of year in the winter, so
I like to wear something that is as warm as possible.  So, my outfit of choice
the other day was a pair of stretchy black pull on jodhpurs with an
elasticated waist and a fleece jumper.  The jodhpurs are old and worn but
incredibly comfy and roasty toasty warm to wear.  I also had on really thick
knee length socks, because they are warm too, and the soles of the socks are
quite thick, which means I can get away without putting any shoes on if I’m
just pottering about at home.  I am always more comfortable with bare feet
indoors, but just now it’s winter and a bit too cold for that, hence woolly
socks are the order of the day.  For my top, I pulled on an over-sized fleece.
Again, it is lovely and warm and stretchy too.   It is also black, so I’m
dressed like a stage hand at the theatre!  (Perhaps you don’t know, but the
people who shift scenery between acts for stage plays are always dressed
completely in black so they disappear into the background when they are moving
things around.)  I definitely don’t look glamourous, and I hope that I won’t
have to answer the door to the postman or anyone else as I look a bit of a
mess quite frankly.  However, if I’m really honest, if I could get away with
wearing such casual and comfortable clothes every day then I absolutely would.

So, when I was getting dressed for an ‘at-home’ day the other week, I didn’t
expect I’d be telling you all about my clothing choices now, but somehow, I
don’t think I’d get away with pretending I lounge about my flat wearing a ball
gown and heels.  I’m just not the dressy type.  Others might describe dressing
up for a night out, for me, it’s all about dressing down for a night curled up
on the sofa with a nice cup of tea!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a surprise that made you happy.

**You should say:**

  * what it was
  * where it happened
  * when it happened

**and explain why the surprise made you happy.**

**Model Answer 1: **  
I can think of a lovely surprise to share with you.  I’m going to tell you
what it was, where it happened and when, and then explain exactly why the
unexpected happening made me so happy.

The surprise started with a card from the post office put through my letter
box.  The card said that they had tried to deliver a parcel to me, but because
I was out when they called they hadn’t been able to leave it, so I’d have to
go and pick it up from the parcel depot.  I was intrigued.  I hadn’t ordered
anything online, it wasn’t my birthday, and I wasn’t expecting anything
exciting in the post at all.  I had no idea what it could possibly be.  The
next morning I went to the post office with some ID to prove who I was, and
collected the parcel.  It was a box, about the size of a shoe box, wrapped in
a dark grey plastic packaging, with the name of the company ‘blurt’ on it.  I
was none the wiser, I didn’t recognise the company and couldn’t tell who it
was from by the wrapping.

I waited until I got home, and then I opened it.  The parcel contained a brown
cardboard box which said ‘Buddy Box’ on the outside.  Inside, was a collection
of rather random, but very charming gift items.  They included a pair of socks
made from bamboo; some rather strongly scented soap (I wasn’t too sure about
that!); a little blank pad of writing paper with a cover decorated with cactus
plants, a ‘sew your own’ cactus kit (that was very bizarre) and an ultra-thin
pen for sliding inside a diary or notebook!  There was still no card to say
who it was from, but just an anonymous typed note saying ‘I saw this and
thought of you!’  It was a completely unexpected gift, sent by someone,
somewhere to cheer me up.  I’d had a rather bad time recently following a
bereavement and losing my job as well, so I’d been quite down, knowing that
someone was thinking about me was really touching, and as well as being a
surprise, made me very happy.  The parcel came just a month ago, so it is a
very recent surprise, but a lovely one.

So that is the ‘what’, the ‘where’ and the ‘when’, as to the ‘why’ that is
perhaps a little more complicated than you might at first think.  Of course it
was lovely to receive the gift from someone, the contents didn’t matter, it
really was ‘the thought that counts’ as the English saying goes, but what made
it extra special, was trying to guess who it was from.  I’d been feeling quite
lonely, but when I tried to work out who might have sent the parcel to me, I
realised I just didn’t know.  Even though I had been feeling a bit sorry for
myself, I could actually come up with quite a long list of people who might
have been thinking of me and wanting to cheer me up.  I was astonished, and I
felt very lucky indeed.

So this surprise made me happy, not only because it was an unexpected gift of
lovely things, but also because it reminded me of how many friends I had
around me who cared about me at a difficult time.

**Model Answer 2: **  
The whole point about surprises is that they can catch you completely
unawares. You wake up one morning with no particular expectation that anything
unusual is going to happen that day, and perhaps anticipating a rather
ordinary and dull working day or weekend ahead of you. Then something
remarkable happens, and the world feels full of exciting possibilities and
adventures all over again!

I’m going to talk to you about a really big surprise that made me very happy
indeed.  I think you too will be a bit taken aback with how unexpected it was
as I tell you the ‘what’ the ‘where’ and the ‘when’ – I imagine you won’t need
me to explain too much why the surprise made me happy, but I will tell you
about that two.

I’ll start with the where and when, because that makes more sense of the
story.  It was a Saturday morning about two and a half years ago.  I went down
to my local park near to where I live in Sheffield, to take part in a 5km run
which is a regular weekly event called Parkrun, which lots of people in the UK
participate in, there are over 364 different Parkrun events held in open
spaces across the UK so it is quite a phenomenon.  This particular event is
quite large, with around 500 runners - of all different ages, backgrounds and
speeds – taking part.  On this particular day, after the run I was walking
away towards home when I suddenly saw a face I recognised.  ‘Hello’, I said,
‘hello Lucy’ she replied, and that was the beginning of our reunion.  The
person I’d recognised was someone I had been at school with thirty years ago
in a completely different part of the UK.  When she finished school, she’d
moved away to Sheffield to study and made a home here, I hadn’t kept in touch
with her, so when I myself moved to Sheffield to take up a new job some 25
years later, I had no idea she lived in the same city.  We met each other
completely by chance after three decades, and recognised each other instantly.
It was certainly a surprise!  What made it even more unexpected, was that we
were both taking part in a sporting activity.  At school neither of us had
enjoyed physical education, or PE as it was then called, and quite often had
skipped school to avoid it!  It was so funny to us both that we should meet up
after so long, at such an unlikely occasion and in a city hundreds of miles
away from where we used to live as children.  We went off for a ‘quick’ coffee
to catch up, and ended up talking solidly for over 3 hours!

It made us both very happy, because we picked up on an old friendship almost
exactly where we had left off.  We now meet up at the same event every
Saturday, and after our run we still go for breakfast each week.  We also take
part in running events together – though I’m really slow and she’s really
fast, so we don’t have everything in common.

So that particular day brought a very unusual surprise my way, and one which
made me happy not only at the time, but right up to the present day and I hope
beyond it too.  It is good to be reminded to look around you and to be open to
the unexpected, it makes life a lot more interesting, and a lot more fun!

sample%2F2294-ielts-cue-card-sample-412-describe-your-dream-
job&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your dream job.

**You should say:**

  * what qualification or experience you would need for this job
  * what the job would involve
  * what you think the most difficult thing about the job would be

**and explain why it is your dream job. **

**Model Answer 1: **  
Today I am going to talk about my dream Job for the future.  I am going to
tell you what the job is, the sort of experience and qualifications I might
need to do it, then what it involves including what might be the most
difficult thing about the job.  I think it will be pretty obvious why it is my
dream job, but I’ll explain that too.  
My dream job would be to be a travel writer!

Travel writers are often self-employed.  They travel the world to interesting
places and then write magazine, newspaper and internet articles about their
experiences.  In terms of qualifications, I think that’s less important than
having a portfolio of examples of your work that show you are a really good
writer.  Having said that, possibly qualifications that provide a good basic
level of English language are useful, and maybe even creative writing or
journalism courses might help you to build confidence and develop a writing
style

To do this job you have to be willing to go to lots of new places.  You also
need to be able to write fluently and in different styles for different
publications.  Travel writers must be very flexible, as you might need to go
to difficult or uncomfortable places and to travel at short notice.

The most difficult part of the job?  Well, it’s not very well paid, so often
travel writers need to have another job a well, because, unfortunately, you
can’t really make a living out of this type of work.  Also, even if you are
successful, it would be quite an unsettled way to live, it would be hard to
maintain friends and pursue hobbies if you are moving around all the time …
mind you, I think that would be a small price to pay to be part of such a
fantastically interesting and stimulating profession!

The reason I would like to do this job so much, is that I love going to new
places.  For example, earlier this year I got to go to Vietnam to work as a
TEFL teacher, that was a new and wonderful experience for me.  I would so
enjoy telling other people what it was like and encouraging them to go on an
adventure of their own. I also like communicating ideas in writing, it would
be wonderful to make a living out of the two things I enjoy most – travel and
writing!

Unfortunately, there are very few opportunities to make a living as a travel
writer, so I think it might have to stay as my dream Job, rather than my
actual job!  Even so, I think it is important to have a dream, because
otherwise how can you ever have a dream come true!

[ Written by - **Lucy Marris**:  Careers Adviser (UK), TEFL teacher (Vietnam)
]

**Cue Card Answer 2: **  
My dream job?  Easy.  I’d like to work in wildlife conservation.  I’ve thought
about it quite a lot, so I can tell you all about the qualifications and
experience that can help you get a ‘foot in the door’ what the job might
involve and the difficult parts of it too.  I’ll try and explain why it would
be, for me anyway, a dream come true to be doing it.

There are lots of different ways to be involved in wildlife conservation all
over the world.  You might be trying to save rhinos from being poached in
South Africa, or looking after injured wildlife like hedgehogs or foxes in the
UK.  Wherever you want to work, and whether it is with just one species (like
elephants) or whole ecosystems (like keeping the arctic or desert free from
the impact of man) a lot of the principles are the same.  You have to
demonstrate commitment through practical experience.  In practice, this means
volunteering.  It might be helping with a local conservation charity,
maintaining woodland habitats for example by removing non-native species and
keeping trees healthy through appropriate pruning.  It could be volunteering
in a more hands-on way with animals, helping care for seabirds affected by oil
pollution, or it might be through looking after other mammals, working at a
riding stables or farm.  This experience shows that you quite literally don’t
mind getting your hands dirty and have some physical stamina too –working
outdoors for wildlife conservation can take you to some quite demanding
environments, and it is hard work.  However, as well as this practical
experience, qualifications are helpful too.

Environmental qualifications help you understand how habitats and ecosystems
fit together.  Science courses in biology and botany help enormously, but so
too might a politics or economics course.  If you take the example of rhino
poaching this is not a ‘simple’ matter of protecting individual animals or
even their habitats, it is also about understanding the global business of
dealing in rhino horn, why it is in demand and how this demand might be
stopped.  Fund raising skills are needed, and IT and communication skills too
to help charities and NGOs explain their causes.  Wildlife conservation is a
multi-disciplinary endeavour, many people are needed, from different countries
too.

In terms of what the job involves, it can be very diverse.  It involves all
aspects of managing and protecting the local environment wherever in the world
that might be.  It could be educating local people about their wildlife and
encouraging them to understand why it is important to preserve it.  It might
involve practically managing the habitat, planting trees or clearing paths.
It could involve observation and monitoring to see what wildlife is present
and whether or not populations are thriving or struggling.  It could be
working in remote island or forest locations, or in more urban habitats where
the interests of wildlife and people clash as their territory encroaches on
one another.

The role is exciting, but I think it could be really difficult too.  Many
animals are at risk of extinction and sadly not all people want to preserve
them.  It would be heart breaking to work to protect an animal, like a rhino
and then to have it poached and killed just for its horn.  It must take
enormous tenacity to pick yourself up and keep on going after a setback like
that, and yet that is what is happening all the time to people in South Africa
working to protect the precious few rhino that are left.  I also think it
would be very difficult when the interests of people are at odds with those of
animals and the wild environment.  In some parts of the world animals are
really threatened – like the gorillas in Rwanda, who are terribly endangered.
However, the people who live around the forests which the gorillas inhabit are
themselves suffering.  They have endured war and poverty, they too need the
resources of the forests in order to survive.  That is a truly difficult test
for conservationists.  How to protect the animals but look after local people
with justice and compassion too.  If my family were starving I would see that
as a greater immediate priority than saving a gorilla I had never seen, but
the crisis for the gorillas is real all the same.  Solutions that help both
man and wildlife to thrive alongside one another (maybe through tourism, so
people benefit from the continuation of the species) are most needed.

I think it would be a really interesting role to help preserve rare and
endangered species for future generations in their natural habitats rather
than just in zoos.  For me a ‘dream job’ would be one that I could be proud to
say I did, and which in some small way made the world a better place for my
time spent on it.  However, I think it would be a troubled dream, because it
is a very difficult one to succeed in.  I think sometimes trying to save
animals from extinction is as futile as trying to hold back the tide of the
seas, however, I still think it is important to try.  If we give up now then
extinction is the only possible outcome, if we all keep on trying to preserve
habitats and the animals that live within them, perhaps we can have a brighter
future for us all?

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 403 - When you received a good service from a

from-a-company&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an occasion when you received a good service from a company or
shop.

**You should say:**

  * what the service was
  * when you received the service
  * where you received the service

**and explain why you think it was a good service.**

**Model Answer: **

Hmm, this is a hard.  It is a sad fact of life that it is a lot easier to
think of examples of terrible customer service from companies or shops, than
it is to think of good service.  However, there is one company I can think of
which has an excellent reputation for customer service and based on my own
experience, I think it is well deserved. So, I’ll try and describe to you what
the service was, when and where I received it and in doing so, explain to you
why I think the service was exceptional.

The service was very simple really, but it became quite complicated, and it
was the way the company resolved it which was so impressive.  The company is a
British Company called John Lewis.  They are a little bit unusual in that the
workforce own shares in the organisation, so that means every individual who
works there take pride in doing their job as well as they can, and takes a
share of any profits.  John Lewis is basically a very chain of upmarket
stores, supplying everything from quality household goods and furnishings
through to clothes and gift items.  The situation was simply this.  My Dad had
become very ill, and I needed to order some extra bed-linen for him whilst he
was being nursed at home. However, he and my mum live in London, and I live in
Sheffield which is two hundred miles away, so I was having to order goods
online to be delivered to my parents many miles away, without knowing quite
what it was they wanted.  To cut a very long story short, I got the order
horribly wrong, I was feeling quite stressed, and I just chose the wrong
products, and then I found that I was too late to cancel the order, and I was
worried that if multiple parcels arrived at my parent’s house they would get
very confused about what was what.  Also, I was quite skint at the time, and
couldn’t really afford to pay for both sets of products, especially as only
one order was really needed.  It was an absolute mess – and I was utterly to
blame.  I’d acted in a hurry and so made mistakes, and I couldn’t see how to
untangle it.  It’s true what they say ‘act in haste, repent at leisure!’

I rang the customer service line.  Everything that had gone wrong was entirely
my fault. I had ordered the wrong goods, I had left it too late to cancel and
it was me who had got the delivery details wrong.  I telephoned and explained
all that had happened, and why it mattered so much.  At the end of the day it
was only a couple of sheets and some towels, but at that moment in time they
were really important because they were much needed.  The person I spoke to
was absolutely lovely.  They managed to somehow by-pass their systems to
cancel the order which had been made in error by contacting the courier
company direct.  They reimbursed postage charges that I’d incurred for
requesting ‘express delivery’ for the original order, and arranged for a new
delivery of the correct items.  They even waved through the second order at a
lower cost than it should have been to speed things up by converting the first
order to the second for the same price.  To them perhaps it was a minor issue
for me to be making such a fuss about, but to me it made an enormous
difference.  As a consumer, I had no rights in this matter, everything they
did was out of good will, not legal obligation.  I can’t tell you how grateful
I was!

So, why do I think this was such good service?  Because they were kind to me
when I had really been quite ‘stupid’ to get things so wrong.  They empathised
with my situation in that I was so far away when my parents were in need of
help, and I was panicking because the one thing I had tried to do – get new
bed linen – had gone wrong.  They worked really hard to go the extra mile to
sort things out even though they absolutely didn’t have to because the error
was all with me.  The people I spoke to presented a very human face of what is
a large organisation, and I remain a very loyal customer to them still.  It is
easy to think of companies as impersonal and anonymous, but in fact all
organisations are staffed by people who are just as human and individual as
you and I at the end of the day.  They helped me out when I needed it, and
that personal touch proves that the people who work in shops and companies are
not unfeeling automatons, they have compassion too.  In some ways, it wasn’t
really about ‘good customer service’ at all in the end, it was about kind
people helping someone else who needed it.  They provided the help because
they could, and they must have felt it was the right thing to do.  You
wouldn’t think getting the right sheets could matter so much, but in a time of
crisis it did.  These people recognised this and saved the day.  It was
comforting, not just to get the much needed bed linen, but to know there are
such kind people in the world willing to go the extra mile when it was needed.
John Lewis, I salute you and your staff for what you did that day.
Insignificant as it may seem, it made all the difference!

###  IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.

##  Talk about a situation when you were surprised to see a person you know.

**You should say:**

  * who this person was
  * when and where you saw him/ her
  * what you were doing then

**and explain why you were surprised to see this person.**

**Model Answer: **  
This is an easy, peasy topic for me to talk about!  I can think of one
particular situation that stands out in my memory when I bumped into someone
totally unexpectedly, and in the most unlikely of situations.  I’m going to
enjoy telling you all about it, though I wonder if I’ll be able to convey to
you exactly how bizarre it was that that we met again in the way that we did.
I’ll explain who I met, when, where, what we were doing, and why it was such a
big surprise for both of us.

So the person I met was someone I’d been at school with.  Now, for this story
to make sense you have to know that I left school about thirty years ago, so I
hadn’t seen this friend since the day we finished our exams three decades
earlier.  We were friendly at school, but not enough to keep in touch after we
left, and as so often happens we went our different ways and had no idea at
all what had happened to one another in the years that followed.

A few years ago, I moved to Sheffield to take up a new job.  I didn’t know the
city, or anyone in it.  After I’d been there a couple of years, I decided I
needed to get fit, and so when I heard about a local free 5km running event
that took place every Saturday in a park near to where I lived I plucked up
the courage to give it a go.  Now, this was a really unlikely thing for me to
do.  I had never run before in my life, and it was not at all my natural
habitat.  I wasn’t very fast, but I did get round and in a peculiar way I
enjoyed it enough that I went back again the following week.  To my absolute
amazement, it was at this return visit that I spotted a familiar face in the
crowd of nearly 500 runners.  Someone I recognised from school!  The weird
thing was that I didn’t even know she’d also moved to Sheffield (we both went
to school just outside London which is 200 miles away), what’s more, neither
of us was remotely sporty at school, so seeing her there, so far from where we
used to live, doing such an unlikely activity as running and recognising her
after thirty years in such a big crowd was extraordinary!  Even more
amazingly, I just went up to her and said ‘hello Delia’ and she replied ‘hello
Lucy’ and we just knew each other straight away.

We were both amazed!  We went off to have breakfast together and talked
solidly for over three hours.  (It was a long breakfast!).  It turned out
she’d moved to Sheffield straight after doing her A-levels, so had lived here
for years and years, and what’s more, her house was just a couple of miles
away from the flat I was renting.  We seemed to pick up exactly where we’d
left off.  Better than that really.  We now meet up to run and then have
breakfast together every week, but we also do other things like go to the
cinema or theatre together.  I help her on her allotment sometimes and she has
been a great friend to me.   I feel so lucky that this unlikely and unexpected
meeting helped me to reconnect with a good friend from the past.  It goes to
show it pays to have your eyes peeled and your wits about you when you are out
and about – you never know who you might encounter unexpectedly and where it
might lead!  ‘Surprise’ isn’t quite a big enough word for how I felt spotting
her, but I’m so glad I did.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an exciting competition or sporting event you have witnessed.

**You should say:**

  * what the competition or sporting event was
  * when and where it took place
  * who won

**and explain why it was exciting.**

**Model Answer: **  
Ooh, this is an interesting topic, because I can instantly think of the most
exciting contest I’ve ever witnessed, but I have a feeling it isn’t quite the
sort of example you might have been thinking of when you came up with the
topic.  I hope you’ll agree it’s a reasonable spectacle to talk about though.
It was a battle for life or death, literally, and I was so caught up in
watching it at the time I could hardly breathe, so surely you will want to
hear about it too.

The competition, was in the natural world.  It was a battle for territory,
between two mighty creatures.  I was going to say ‘insects’ but strictly
speaking that isn’t correct, they were two arachnids.  One was a very venomous
and aggressive scorpion, and the other a massive furry type of tarantula
called a baboon spider.

I was working on a conservation project in South Africa, and after a communal
meal with others in the camp where I was staying, I made my way back to my
tent using a head torch to light my way.  I knew there was a baboon spider
living in a burrow near to where I was camping.  It might sound a bit strange,
but I was quite fascinated by this spider.  I had learned that if you caught a
moth (easy as they would crowd around the light of my head torch) then you
could use it to tempt out the spider.  I would do this by holding the moth
with my outstretched fingers just outside the burrow’s entrance, and then,
after a few seconds, the baboon spider sensing the movement would emerge and
grab the moth and drag it back into the earth to eat.  People who know me at
home in England would be astonished that I did this as actually I’m quite
scared of spiders in my house.  However, this tarantula was different, so
large, solid and furry solid it was almost like a mammal, and it moved in a
predictable way, basically just staying in its burrow, just emerging at night
to snatch unlucky prey that attracted its attention on passing by.

Anyway, I had got into the habit of taking a moth back with me after supper,
so I could feed the spider as I went past.  On this particular evening though
as I caught sight of the burrow in the beam of my torch I saw the strangest
thing.  The great spider was out of its burrow – really unusual as they spend
almost the entire time in their underground lairs – and it appeared to be
somersaulting!  As I watched I saw to my dismay that it was intertwined with a
really dangerous scorpion of similar size.  I could tell the scorpion was a
deadly one, because it had a huge venom filled sting and relatively small
pincers (I looked it up in a book later and it is one of the most lethal
species in the continent!).   The two were fighting ferociously, tumbling
about in the orange earth and short scrub grass.  I called over a friend to
come and witness it too.  It was astonishing to watch, the scorpion kept
trying to sting the spider’s abdomen, but the spider was so big its legs kept
the scorpion away.  Over the next few minutes though, the spider began to
tire.  It was very sad to watch, the scorpion was victorious.  The spider was
left dying just a few inches from the burrow, and the scorpion entered the
hole and took possession of it for itself.  I carried on watching with my
friend, the scorpion began to use the burrow as a base to hunt, lying in wait
and then emerging to grab termites that were passing by.  I felt so sad as I
had lost my spider friend, but I also felt I’d witnessed something really
remarkable.  These, to us, small creatures, were mighty titans when in battle
with one another, and I had, had absolutely no idea how their fight would end.

So this competition was between a scorpion and a tarantula.  It took place on
the plains of South Africa in the dark of night and the scorpion was
triumphant. It was horrifying, but exciting to watch because it was a battle
to the death and silly as it sounds, I felt like I ‘knew’ one of the
competitors.  Witnessing it gave me a renewed appreciation of the natural
world and its wonders.  What a remarkable place we inhabit, and what
extraordinary creatures live alongside us the world over!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a gift you bought that took a long time to find.

**You should say:**

  * what it was
  * who you bought it for
  * where you bought it from

**and explain how se /she felt after receiving it.**

**Model Answer: **  
There is a saying when it comes to giving gifts, that it is ‘the thought that
counts’. Often when people say this, what they mean is that the gift was
really terrible, but the recipient no doubt appreciated the sentiment behind
it. The choice of gift was perhaps ill-judged, but very well intended, as
such, it should be received with warmth and a show of enthusiasm – even if
that enthusiasm is a bit forced! However, I think there is also a more
positive interpretation, a really thoughtful gift is much more likely to
delight both the giver and the receiver than the most expensive of trophies. I
always try really hard to think about what gifts my closest friends and family
might really like or want, even if they haven’t perhaps worked it out for
themselves. Sometimes it’s really easy to think of something and just go out
and buy it, at other times it’s much more of a challenge.

I’m going to tell you about an occasion when I knew exactly what it was I
wanted to find as a gift for someone, but it was a real problem to find. I’ll
tell you what it was; who I bought it for; where I bought it from and how the
gift was received.

There is a bit of a story I’m afraid, so bear with me! I used to live in a
little terraced house in a town called Leamington Spa. By chance, I moved into
my house just a couple of weeks after my next-door neighbours had also moved
in. Fortunately, we got on really, really well together. We used to chat over
the garden wall (though I had to stand on tip toe to do this because I’m quite
short); I’d look after their cat when they went on holiday, and we were often
in and out of each other’s houses. After a few years, one of them came round
to tell me some ‘bad news’ I was terrified about what they might say – was one
of them really ill? It turned out that the ‘bad news’ was they had decided to
sell up and move away. I was really sad to see them go, but happy they would
be moving to a lovely new house which was more suited to their lifestyle.
Anyway, it turned out that selling their house was quite traumatic. They found
a buyer really quickly, but that person was awkward and petulant and kept
insisting on quite unreasonable conditions and threatening to pull out of the
sale at the slightest inconvenience. The buyer wouldn’t negotiate on anything,
and it all got a bit unpleasant.

As is often the way, the deal-breaker turned out to be something ridiculously
trivial. My neighbours had a really unusual steel soap dish. It had chunky
letters spelling out the word ‘soap’ and a similarly chunky tray to put a bar
of soap in, and was hung up in their bathroom. It was nice, and it did match
the other fixtures and fittings in the room, but it was also most definitely a
moveable personal possession that anyone would normally expect to take with
them when they moved, and not especially valuable either to be honest. It had
been a gift from one of the couple to the other, and had sentimental rather
than any great monetary value. However, their house buyer had their eye on it,
and threatened to walk away from the purchase if it didn’t come with the
house. It was unbelievably stupid of the purchaser to insist on such a trivial
thing, but it would have been even more stupid for my neighbours to let their
house sale fall through because of a soap dish, however special it might be to
them personally. Sadly, they agreed she could have this with the house, and
the sale went through.

In the meantime I’d been trying really hard to think of a suitable house-
warming present for my dear friends to wish them well in their new home but it
was tricky. To be blunt, they were a lot wealthier than me and in any case
already had most things they needed following a recent wedding and the
associated gifts from well-wishers. I couldn’t afford to spend a lot of money,
but I wanted to choose something that I knew they would like and would be
really thoughtful. I decided I would try and find them an identical soap dish!

It took me a long time, a couple of months. I searched the internet and eBay
for second hand items (the dish wasn’t manufactured anymore and in any case
was not a mass produced product in the first place). I scoured second hand
shops and looked everywhere. I almost gave up hope. However, one day, I
couldn’t believe it! There it was, on eBay! An identical product, in near-new
condition, just sitting there waiting for me. I snapped it up immediately with
a ‘buy now’ price rather than risking losing out in a bidding war. It really
wasn’t very much, it was an unlikely item to desperately want after all! I was
so delighted when it arrived through the post and it was indeed exactly as
advertised! I couldn’t wait to give it to my old neighbours for their new
house!

I rushed round one evening to their new home when they would both be there,
and presented it to them carefully gift wrapped. I think they were a bit
nervous about opening it because I was so obviously confident they would like
it, a lot. They were worried about how to disguise their reactions if they
didn’t. It might be hard to pretend. I wasn’t worried though, I just knew it
was the perfect gift! I asked them to try and guess what it might be, but they
had no idea. Eventually, they ripped off the wrapping paper and… were
absolutely delighted! It wasn’t just that they had their soap dish back, it
was that they were really touched I’d worked so hard to find it for them, and
persevered long after they’d given up any hope of replacing their original one
for themselves.

It is said that it is better to give than receive, I think sometimes it is! My
neighbours absolutely loved the present, but I was bursting with pleasure too.
I knew I’d got it right, and that they would treasure this unlikely gift too.
It was indeed a gift that took me a long, long time to find, but it was very
well worth the effort! Since then, they have moved house again – this time,
they took ‘my’ soap dish with them! I still smile at the memory, certainly on
this occasion it really was the thought that counted most!

###  IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.

##  Describe a wild animal that can be found in your country.

**You should say:**

  * what it is and what it looks like
  * where it lives
  * what you like /dislike about it

**And explain how people in your country generally feel about it.**

**Sample Answer: **  
I live in England in the United Kingdom, and you might think we don’t have
many wild animals, but in fact we do.  They are generally quite small and
elusive, but lovely nevertheless, and they feature in lots of children’s
stories.  Perhaps you’ll have heard of Beatrix Potter?  She wrote beautifully
illustrated books for children which were based on her imagined adventures for
creatures from our countryside like rabbits, hedgehogs and even toads.

I’m going to tell you about one of my favourite wild animals from my country.
I’ll explain what it is, and what it looks like.  Where it lives – though that
is quite complicated.  What I like about it and a bit about how others feel
about them. You will find there are very different views!The animal I am
thinking of is about the size of a domestic cat, though in appearance it more
resembles a dog.  It has a reddish coat and a long bushy tail, called a
‘brush’ which always has a white tip to it.  They vary a little in colour, but
often have a white underbelly, and attractive black markings at the edge of
their pointed ears.  Can you guess what it is?  A red fox!

As to where foxes generally live, that is quite interesting. Historically,
they were a feature of the countryside.  People think of them as carnivores,
meat eaters, but in fact they are omnivores.  They do need a certain amount of
prey, and will typically eat rabbits, birds, shrews and mice, for which they
hunt,  as well as insects, berries, eggs and carrion (any dead animals they
come across).  However, they are also clever opportunists, so in the
countryside they will take domestic poultry if they can.  In the countryside,
they can come into conflict with farmers if they get into a chicken shed, they
react to the panicking hens and can kill every bird in the hen house though
only eating one.  They aren’t popular on large estates where landowners raise
pheasants for shooting.  They have come to be regarded as something of a pest
in the countryside, though not by everyone.  Until quite recently it was legal
to hunt foxes with dogs – I don’t agree with hunting at all, it horrifies me
to think of a mob of people on horseback running down a solitary fox with a
pack of dogs.  I don’t agree with shooting pheasants either, a horrible so-
called ‘sport’.  Because foxes have been quite persecuted in the countryside,
they have increasingly moved into urban areas.  They are very resourceful and
adaptable, and actually have done really well living in towns and cities
alongside people.  In this environment they are largely scavengers, raiding
bins, eating discarded food from shops and restaurants, and living alongside
railway tracks where there is still some cover of vegetation in which they can
build dens.

The urban fox is doing so well, they are really common, and probably more now
live in the towns than in the countryside.  They are more active at dusk
perhaps, but it is relatively easy to spot them.  I think they are really
beautiful, and I find it extraordinary that such a relatively large mammal can
live alongside people in such a seemingly unpromising environment.  They are
so habituated to people they can become quite bold.  They are still wild
animals, and should not be regarded as tame, but they will come quite close.
Where my parents live a fox used to regularly stop by their garden every
evening to see if any food had been left out.  Lots of people leave scraps out
for ‘their’ foxes, as you might put out seeds to feed the birds that visit
your garden.  The fox always came at the same time, so my parents started to
sit out and wait for it, and the fox would come within a couple of feet of
them.  It came so frequently, it wore a track in the lawn so you could see its
exact route across the garden.  Even if you can’t see foxes, you can hear them
at night calling. The sound is quite alarming if you haven’t heard it before.
They give out a range of calls, but sometimes it can be mistaken for someone
screaming.  It’s quite something!

People have very different views about foxes.  Some people regard them as
pests that take livestock in the countryside and upturn rubbish bins in the
city.  Others, like me, treasure this beautiful creature.  I have seen the
damage foxes can cause to a hen house, and it is bad, but they are wild
animals acting on instinct, you just have to make sure your poultry sheds are
fox-proof as best you can.  I feel really privileged that even in the midst of
a city you might catch a glimpse of a fox at night, loping along.  Where I
live now, after it snows, I can see fox tracks in the garden.  I find it
comforting that even though these animals are so persecuted in some rural
areas, they have found a way to adapt and survive.  They are glorious to
behold and give me hope that endangered as many species are, foxes at least
have found a way to endure!

sample%2F2315-ielts-cue-card-sample-421-a-friend-who-you-think-is-a-good-
leader&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

###  IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.

##  Talk about a friend who you think is a good leader.

**You should say:**

  * who is he /she
  * what he/ she does
  * how you met him /her

**And explain why you think he/she is a good leader.**

**Model Answer: **  
A ‘good leader’.  That’s quite a philosophical concept!  I can think of a
friend who I think is a brilliant leader.  I’m going to tell you all about
her.  Who she is, what she does, how I come to know her, but most importantly
what it is about her approach that I think makes her a great leader.

So this is a friend of mine I was at school with.  After finishing our
education with both went in different directions, and I didn’t see her again
for thirty years when we met up again completely by chance in a different city
where we were both now living.  It’s actually quite hard to describe ‘what she
does’ because that is part of her style, she does lots of different things,
and it seems wrong somehow to pigeon hole her with just one activity  She
makes a living through running her own business making specially decorated
biscuits which she supplies by mail order.  But she is the sort of person who
always has a multitude of things on the go at any one time.  She is involved
in many sports clubs, on the organising committee for the local scouts (a
national youth organisation) - including arranging an annual Guy Fawkes’ Night
bonfire and firework display for many years which is their main fundraising
event; and on top of that she is always initiating new – to me ambitious –
projects like holding a huge birthday party or suggesting an outing further
afield.

What makes this friend a good leader is hard to pin point.  I don’t think it
is any one thing, it is rather a combination of positive characteristics.  She
is very energetic, so prepared to work hard to get things done.  She is
optimistic, inclined to see opportunities and possibilities where other people
might be put off by potential problems.  This energy and optimism engages
other people.  You can be confident if you invest time and energy in
supporting her ideas they will happen, it won’t be a waste of time.  She is
also incredibly well organised, with an attention to detail.  This is
important for morale!  It means that if you turn up in the pouring rain to, I
don’t know, build a bonfire or erect a tent, she will have thought of things
that make it fun.   You will find a gas bottle fuelled urn of bubbling hot
water to make tea to keep you going, or maybe at a certain time a mass order
of scalding hot chips, wrapped in paper from the local chip shop will appear
as if by magic to keep everyone going for a couple more hours.  She has an
ability to network, which means if one of her projects require some particular
expertise she’ll almost inevitably know someone who knows someone that will
get it done for free.  It is inspiring to be involved in her projects, you get
a great sense of satisfaction working together as part of a team, confident
that the person driving it all forwards knows what needs to be done, and that
it will be enjoyable along the way.  When whatever project it is has finished,
she always remembers to thank you and let you know for example how much money
was raised, or how many people attended.  It is quite a skill.

Leadership is not easy.  A good leader in my view inspires and motivates
others to do their best, rather than tells people what to do.  By believing in
you, they can help you believe in yourself, and then everyone together
achieves far more than they ever could on their own, and probably a great deal
more than they thought possible at the outset…. If only my managers and bosses
in the workplace had such good leadership skills I think I’d get a lot more
done!

###  IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.

##  Describe your favourite way to relax.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * when and how you relax.
  * how effective it is for you

**And explain why you like this way of relaxation.**

**Sample Answer:**  
My favourite way to relax is bit strange and my parents often find it hard to
believe that I love to relax in this way. Well, this is not the only way I
relax but definitely this is my favourite one. To me relaxing and serenity is
related. So I close the doors and windows of my room and lit a low powered
light bulb to cut the outside noise and bright light. I live in a busy urban
area so it’s usually noisy around me.

Then I turn on the CD player and play either Pink Floyd or Enigma in a low
volume. Then I close my eyes and try to recall my happy memories of my
childhood. This gives me immense pleasure as most of my child hood memories
are spellbinding and magical. If I spend about half an hour this way I start
feeling a sensation that is utmost pleasant. I remain half awake and half
asleep and an hour is good enough for me to get fully recharged and refreshed.

I usually do it at home, more specifically in my room. Whenever I feel
stressed or depressed I try to relax in this way to eliminate my stress and
depression. I would not say it works all the time but I find it very
effective. I guess during this process I try to feel happy as I get lost in my
childhood and that’s something I have psychologically accepted as a remedy of
my depression or hard time. Since I have been doing it for a while and my body
and mind have got adjusted with this process, it works like a panacea to me.

My second best way of relaxation is reading books or visiting a naturally
beautiful place. But the one I told you is most effective for me.

####  If you can talk about this cue card, you should be able to answer the
following cue card topics as well:

1\. Describe something you often do.  
2\. Describe something unusual you did recently.  
3\. Describe something you started doing lately.

wait&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

###  IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.

##  Talk about an event when you had to wait.

**You should say:**

  * what it was
  * how long you waited
  * why you had to wait

**and explain how you felt about it.**

**Sample Answer:**  
I really hate waiting for things.  Once I’ve decided on a course of action
that I want to do, I like to do it immediately.  I am impatient.  Sometimes
though, things are completely outside of your control, and like it or not, the
waiting goes on and on as if for ever!

I can think of one example of waiting that seemed to last an eternity.  I’m
going to tell you what it was, how long I had to wait and why – I think you
can probably guess already how I felt about it, but I’ll explain that as well
anyway.

The situation was I was in a job where I really wanted to obtain an extra
qualification in recognition of the work I was doing.  The award was a
Fellowship from the Higher Education Academy, and it is a very useful
qualification for teaching in Higher Education in the UK.  This was an award
you could gain by submitting evidence of your capabilities through
testimonials from others, examples of reflections on your work, and proof of
attending various professional development courses.  However, there was a
problem.  No-one else in my job role had ever done this qualification before,
and although I thought it would be appropriate and possible, I had no way of
knowing if the panel who would assess my portfolio would feel the same way.  I
was a bit sneaky, because I didn’t think my manager would support me in making
the application, so I decided to do it all in my own time, and in my own way.
The way it worked, was once you had submitted your portfolio of evidence, a
panel of senior academic colleagues would meet to discuss it, and then they
would agree whether or not you adequately met the required standard.  The
panel though, met very infrequently.  Only every two months, and not at all
during the summer.  A key part of the application was a reference from a
senior colleague in support of my request for recognition.  I worked really
hard to gather the evidence, I read widely to provide lots of references in
support of my submission.  I got testimonials from others, and advice from
friends working at different institutions who had already obtained the
qualification. Finally though, I had done everything I could, I just needed a
referee, and I didn’t want to use my manager.  It was a problem.

Eventually I plucked up courage to ask a very senior colleague who I greatly
respected.  I was delighted that he enthusiastically agreed to provide the
necessary reference in support of my submission.  However, he was very busy,
and although he promised to do it, he wasn’t able to provide it in time for me
to get my application in for the last panel before the summer.  This meant, I
had to wait three months after completing my portfolio, before the panel met
to agree my fate.  I knew I’d worked as hard as I could, but I also knew I was
an unusual case, so I had no idea at all what the panel would decide.  It was
a very long summer.  I had to wait nearly three months for when the next panel
met before I knew my fate!  I was nervous, and anxious too.  Some days I felt
really confident that of course I would pass, I’d worked so hard and
researched so thoroughly.  On other days I wished I hadn’t ever embarked on
the process.  How could I possibly gain the qualification when no-one else in
my job role had done so before -mind you, no-one had tried before either, so
there was always that glimmer of hope to keep me going.

Then, one day in the autumn, a rather dull looking email pinged into my in-box
at work.  Congratulations, you have been awarded the FHEA!  That was it, I’d
done it!  I couldn’t believe it.  After months of waiting, and anxious
anticipation, that was that!  I hadn’t even known the panel would be meeting
so it was a real surprise.  I was so delighted that my hard work had paid off.
Once I got the award, I explained to my manager, and he was understanding
about it.  Part of my reticence was that I thought if I’d tried and failed it
would have been embarrassing.  Of course now I passed, everything was well
with the world!

So the waiting was horrible, but it was worth it in the end.  I was glad I’d
taken the risk and held out to the end, but I hope I’m never again kept in
suspense for an exam result for quite so long in the future!

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 439 - Describe a photograph you have taken yourself

yourself&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a photograph you have taken yourself which you particularly like.

**You should say:**

  * what the picture shows
  * when you took it
  * why you took it

**and explain why you particularly like this photograph.**

**Sample Answer:**  
I have never been a professional photographer and yet I have a great passion
in photography. I know very little about the technical aspects of camera and
to be honest I take photos from my own preference rather than maintaining
aspects a professional photographer would do. The websites like Flickr,
Instagram and Pinterest have made it possible to store photos easily and I
upload pictures I take mostly in Flickr.

Now getting back to ‘a photograph I have taken and I really like’- is a tough
call for me. In fact there are so many of them. For this topic I will pick a
photograph that I took 4 years ago which portrays the serene nature of the
rural life and ingenuine smile of a mother who was looking at her 2 years old
daughter. I submitted this photo in a competition organized by a magazine and
surprisingly it won the second prize.

It was 2012; probably mid-August and I went to one of my friends’ hometown
with four other friends. This was actually a semester break and we wanted to
enjoy our vacation in a remote and beautiful location. We stayed there for
about 5 days and we had a great experience in this beautiful place. I had my
cameral with me and whenever I found something worth capturing, I took the
photo. The photograph I am taking about shows green paddy fields and a clear
blue sky in the background. The main subject of the photograph was a young
mother who was looking at her daughter and was smiling. Among other things, a
flying eagle, two other women and a large green tree were visible in the
photograph.

When I took the photo, I knew that it was going to be a great scene and moment
to capture in a frame. When I saw the digital version of this photo, I simply
loved it. This particular photograph got a lot of positive reviews and
comments just within few days I uploaded it in Flickr. I loved the theme of
this photo and it was one of the best shots I have ever taken. After it won
the second prize, I knew that it is a worth praising photograph and one of the
best I have ever taken. In fact, positive reviews, appreciating feedback, my
memory relating this photograph and its nomination for an important contest
makes it one of the best photographs ever taken by me.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a famous building / landmark in your home town.

**You should say:**

  * where it is
  * how old it is
  * how it looks

**and explain why think it is an important landmark/ building.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Thank you very much for this wonderful topic. I would like to talk about the
‘City Museum’ which is located at the western part of the city I live in and
which is one of the most popular buildings in our town.

This building once was the city hall and was built in 1756 by the Portuguese.
Some renovation works has been done on this museum but the original design of
it was not changed. The city museum still gives an impression of a fine
architecture of the past and attracts so many tourists each day. People like
to look at it and praise the design of this building. The interior of it is
full of historical evidences of our past and a museum visitor is bound to love
his tour in this museum for the reach experience it offers to everybody. This
building is located near a park and the central library which is well known
among the local people. As I said, it is more than 250 years old and in fact
one of the most visited and oldest building in our city.

This building is a very important architectural proof of mid Eighteen century.
It looks like a castle from far away while it gives the impression of a
gigantic temple when it is looked very closely. This red coloured building was
turned in to a museum in 1920 and all the history lovers around the world
visit it for the local history and other important objects it holds.

In my opinion, this is a quite important building in our city. First, it
represents our past and it signifies our present also. All the important
historical and cultural objects and proofs have been stored there. Besides,
this is one of the most popular tourist spots in our city that not only earns
a huge sum of money, but also introduces our local culture to the visiting
tourists. To elucidate the importance of this building I can mention that this
building is one of our prides and the government spends a large some amount of
money each year to maintain its originality. In my childhood I lived in an
urban area and I read about this building in my text book probably in grade
three or four.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. Is it important to conserve old buildings?  
  
Q. What famous landmarks your city / hometown has?  
  
Q. What is the importance of old historical building?  
  
Q. Do many people in your country live in old buildings?  
  
Q. What do you prefer, an old or a modern building to live in?  
  
Q. How the modern buildings are different than that of old buildings?

###  IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.

##  Describe a place that you have visited that you particularly liked.

**You should say:**

  * when you visited there
  * who you went with
  * what was most memorable

**And explain what you liked most about this place.**

**Sample Answer: **  
Travelling is my passion and I love to explore new places. I even have a wish
list of places I would love to go before I die. Among the places I have been
to, Sanyou Cave in China is a place that I particularly liked and would love
to visit again.

It was 2005 when I went there with my family members. It would probably be mid
July of 2005 when I had been there. My parents are also fond of travelling new
places and my father actually selected this place for a two week’s tour. I
went there with my parents, my elder brother and his wife. We wanted to take
my grandmother but she declined the proposal considering her health condition.

Sanyou Cave is in the sheer cliff at the northern region of Xiling Gorge. This
was about 6 miles away from the Yichang City of China. This is considered as
one of the best cave scenery in the Asia and the whole part was something
unexpected to me.

Walking up the path from the cave to the Zhixin pavilion was the most
memorable part of this tour. My father was with me and he said ‘is not it
beautiful?’ twice during our walk. I thought I time travelled to a distant
past and was part of another time and dimension that I actually live in.

When we arrived near the cave and looked around, I was awe stricken. It was
quite surprising for me to witness a place that I never thought would exist.
This place reminded me the movie ‘Time machine’ that I watched many years
before. It was so beautiful a place that I liked every moment of our staying
there. We spent the night in a hotel established in the cave and that was
enthralling. The meaning of the words ‘Sanyou Cave’ is ‘Cave of the Three
Travelers’ and it is said that this is a place that inspire people. The
exceptional inspiration I got from this place is something I will cherish,
probably for the rest of my life.

####  If you can talk about this cue card, you should be able to answer the

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an activity you recently took part in.

**You should say:**

  * what activity it is
  * why you took part in it
  * how it was organised

**and explain your feeling about this activity.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Recently I took part in a social activity which I would like to talk about for
this cue card topic. It was a social campaign to inform everyone in our
community about the vaccination for children. This was an important
vaccination project that the government was funding and our objective was to
inform everyone in our community so that children from 6 month till 5 years
old get it for free from the designated centres on the due date. The awareness
campaign was organized by our university and I participated in it to be a part
of an important social cause. It was a 3 day long campaign and I felt really
great to be able to deliver an important message to every single community
member.

In fact this was not the first time I participated in such an activity. My
mother is a social worker and from her I learned the importance of being part
of such great activities. Last month when I heard that one of our university
teachers was looking for few students to contribute in this campaign, I did
not hesitate to be enlisted.

Before we started knocking on the doors of each community member, a government
organisation sent a three members’ team to train us. It was more like a
professional training and workshop where we were taught about our duties
during the campaign. We were handed over a list of our community members and
their probable time of being home. We had to make another list with the name,
address, child’s age and the type of vaccine they are supposed to be given. We
had a supervisor in our team from the beginning of this campaign and he guided
us whenever we needed his advice. I would say that the organisation of this
campaign was quite through and structured.

Honestly, I felt so happy and contended about this whole activity. I knew how
important it was to deliver the message to all our community members so that
they do not miss their children’s vaccination. I thought it was a great social
work which would be quite helpful for the members of our community and did not
hesitate to take part in it. I have always felt quite excited and happy about
being part of any noble and helpful activity and the vaccination campaign was
no exception.

country&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe one of the most popular TV shows in your country.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * what it is about
  * what you like /dislike about it

**and explain why it is so popular in your country.**

**Sample Answer:**  
‘Far from the line’ is a very popular TV show in our country among more than
20 million viewers who enjoy this show a lot. In a recent online poll, this TV
programme was selected as the second most popular TV show of all time in our
country.

This is an investigative news story programme that deals with the crime and
unlawful activities in our society as well as important events in history.
Some of the episodes deal with the details and facts on notorious events of
history. Other episodes introduce unjust and crimes happening around us. It
also alerts us about the types of crimes common in our country and notifies us
about the corruptions. Sometime this programme interviews famous lawyers,
politicians, law-enforcing members, witnesses and victims to give more details
about a crime. Finally some episodes present background of a murder or a
heinous crime that got media attentions. Thus the topic of this programme has
a great variety but the objective remains the same- to aware people. To unveil
a crime and to aware people is the main reason this programme is aired and
this is a successful TV programme so far.

I like the way this programme is presented and the news presenters, anchors
and investigators are quite brilliant and the composition of different events
in this programme is actually remarkable. I like the idea of informing people
about law, crime, criminals and social unjust. In my opinion this programme is
quite helpful to inform citizens about the type of crimes they should be more
cautious about.  It also explains the basic laws, civil rights and how to
inform authority in case anyone has information about a probable crime or
unjust. The way this programme is presented and the variations and exciting
facts the programme makers can bring in each new episode is praiseworthy and
the main reason of its popularity. People in my country love programmes that
educate people and are entertaining at the same time. The programme ‘Far from
the line’ is a perfect blend of important news, messages, excitement and
entertainment and this in my opinion is the mantra of its popularity.

###  Part 3 – Two-way discussion:

Q. How popular is watching television in your country?

Q. Tell me about the types of program that are generally on television in your
country.

Q. Do you think state or private television is better?

Q. What negative influences television can have on children?

Q. Do you think TV programmes are gaining more popularity these days?

Q. what type of television progammes can create controversy among people?

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 438 - Describe your favourite sport

sport&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe your favourite sport.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * how often you play/ watch it
  * how to play it

**and explain why it is your favourite sport.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Cricket is my favourite sport and I love to play it more than any other sport.
I used to play it every day in my childhood and adolescent period but nowadays
I play this sport once in a week, mostly on my days off. However I often watch
international cricket tournaments on TV and never miss the event when my
country plays cricket in an international tournament.

There are basically three different formats of this sport which are widely
popular. They are ‘test matches’ one day cricket’ and ‘T20’. The rules of the
game slightly change based on the format of the cricket. One day cricket
tournament is the most popular format and two teams, each with eleven cricket
players, fight each other to win the match. The captain who wins the toss
decides either to bat or bowl first. Each team play for 50 overs, each over
consists of six bowls, and the team that bats first sets a run target for the
opponent. If the first team can restrict the second team not to collect as
much runs as they have scored, then the first team will win the match. On the
contrary, if the second team can cross the run their opposite team has
accumulated, they will be declared as the winner. A tie is very unlikely,
though not impossible, when two teams’ scores stand as exactly the same. Two
umpires in the field and another one in front of computer devices monitor the
game and decide the rules. The test format and T20 have their own sets of
rules but the fundamentals remains almost the same –score runs and restrict
the opponent from reaching this run, or accumulate more runs than the opponent
has collected.

I have started playing cricket from a very early stage of my life. I have
practices a lot and I had been member of our local cricket team. I would say I
am an all-rounder in cricket and I love to score runs. This is the most
popular sport in our country and I have an acute enthusiasm about playing and
watching this sport. This sport requires fitness, practice, use of techniques,
muscle-power, strategy, team work, and inherent abilities which are quite
exciting to have in a single game. The thrill and excitement this sport offers
is the main reason I like this sport. In fact most of the people in my country
would say that cricket is their favourite sport. We play cricket in the
international level and that makes this sport very popular among our
countrymen.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 429 - Describe a health problem

sample%2F2323-ielts-cue-card-sample-429-describe-a-health-
problem&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

###  IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.

##  Describe a health problem you or someone you know had.

**You should say:**

  * what it was
  * how you had this health problem
  * what you or this person had to do to get better

**And discuss how you/ this person felt about this health problem.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Gosh, that seems like quite a personal topic!  I don’t think I feel quite
comfortable talking about someone else’s health problem, so I’ll pick one that
is about me.  Erm, I’ll tell you what it was, how I had it and how eventually
I got better.  I’ll also try and explain a bit about how I felt, though that’s
hard to do, so you might have to ask me some extra questions to help me make
sense of it!

So what happened was, post-concussion syndrome.  I had a fall from a horse, it
wasn’t even that bad a fall to be honest.  I’d had a riding lesson, and at the
end I was sitting on the horse, standing there just chatting to my instructor,
we weren’t even moving.  Then something happened on the yard, possibly a load
fell off the back of a lorry, or something similar, which made the loudest
noise imaginable, my horse was startled and plunged forward instinctively.  I
was unprepared, so just toppled off backwards, hitting my head as I did so.  I
always wear a hard hat, so that gave me some protection, but it was a hell of
a bang.  In cartoons, you see pictures of people seeing stars after being hit
on the head, and that is what it was like!  My vision went, and I saw bright
light, and my how it hurt!  However, I didn’t lose consciousness or anything,
and I got back on the horse briefly to reassure myself I wouldn’t lose my
nerve.  I put the horse away, untacking and brushing her off, and leaving her
with a big pile of hay to eat (it wasn’t her fault, the ‘fright and flight’
reaction is pure instinct in a prey animal).  I drove home.  I didn’t feel
great, and the next couple of days was the weekend so I didn’t go out, I just
slept a lot, and felt a bit sorry for myself.

On the Monday, I went into work as usual, but felt really peculiar.  It was
the first time in a couple of days that I had seen anyone, and I found that it
was really difficult to communicate.  I had gaps in my vocabulary, and I was
really inappropriately emotional.  The phone on my desk rang, and I just
couldn’t answer it, I felt I wouldn’t know what to say.  It was very
frightening, I just sat and cried.  A colleague I worked with came in, and it
was difficult for me to explain what was wrong as I honestly didn’t know.  She
offered to give me a lift home, but I said I’d be OK to make my own way if she
would let my boss know.  She knew I must be really poorly, as I’d been working
there for over a year and had never before had a day off for anything or even
been late to work.  I left the building and then felt quite panicky as I
couldn’t remember how to get to the bus stop.  I knew this was bad, but I
didn’t know what to do.  I managed to walk home and just went straight to bed.

The next week was awful, I just slept, and cried and felt really confused.  I
knew I wouldn’t be well enough to go to work as I felt very fearful just going
outside.  I made an appointment to see my doctor.  I was very lucky as the
person I saw had by chance a particular interest in head injuries.  She
explained that everything I was experiencing – the loss of memory, the
emotional crying; the fatigue, was actually quite ‘normal’ for some people
following an accident of this type.  That was the good news, the bad news is
that this is known as post-concussion syndrome and there isn’t much you can do
to get better.  You just have to be patient. However she did say that I’d need
to give myself some mental stimulation to help repair the pathways in my
brain, so even though it was exhausting and frightening it was important to
get out, to go for a walk, or get a cup of coffee.  To begin with it was very
difficult to do these things because I was scared I’d forget where I was and
not be able to get home.  I also felt extremely vulnerable because I knew I
looked ‘normal’ but might behave in an inappropriate way – like bursting into
tears in a shop because they didn’t have the newspaper I wanted.  It’s very
difficult to imagine what this is like unless you have experienced it.  You
know you are behaving in a way that is odd, and not acceptable, but you simply
cannot control it.  I also had a few experiences of meeting people who knew
me, but I did not recognise, that was very hard to understand for them and me
too!

I ended up having two weeks off work, and even when I did go back I struggled
for quite some time.  It was many months before I felt my vocabulary was back
and I felt like my thinking was laboured and I was exhausted all the time.

How did I feel?  Terrified, it was a really horrible experience, and I was
very lonely too.  I thought I might not be able to carry on working, and that
I would never get better.  I was also worried I would lose my friends because
my behaviour was so unpredictable and peculiar.  Still, I try to be positive
about these things, and I think it perhaps gave me some understanding and
insight into what it must be like for older people with dementia or anyone
with an acquired brain injury.  Perhaps it has made me more patient, and now
if I see someone doing something odd in the street I consider that they may
not mean to be demanding or rude, perhaps they too have had an injury which
has changed how they interact with other people.  I feel very lucky that
eventually, after about 18 months I am pretty much back to how I was.  I do
still really struggle with names though, and I still don’t always recognise
people when I should.  Perhaps I also have that experience of reaching for a
memory that isn’t quite there more than I ever did before, but it doesn’t stop
me doing anything.

The human body is an amazing thing, it does have the capacity to heal, but you
need to be patient to let it do so.  It is fragile too, and now I think I
appreciate that more as well – it makes me mad if I see cyclists or riders
without protective head gear – if I hadn’t been wearing my helmet, well, I
think the ending would have been very different.

devices have made eCommerce very popular in our country. Ecommerce in my
opinion is so far the most important technological advancement in our country
which has redefined the selling and purchasing of goods and services.

With the popularity of Internet and computer technology the opportunity for
the booming of eCommerce business occurred around 10-12 years ago in our
country. In fact it happened as soon as the concept of eCommerce business was
accepted globally. A huge number of Internet users, a great potential for
business owners, availability and facility of online payment, quick and safe
shipment facilities, development of Information Technology sector in our
country and above all people’s spontaneous participation have contributed
towards the advancement of eCommerce technology. Facebook is quite popular in
our country and the concept of Facebook commerce or F-commerce has also become
popular as thousand of store owners have started selling products through
facebook stores or facebook pages. F-commerce is another form of eCommerce or
electronic commerce which is also gaining its popularity.

Technological advancement is ever changing and it does not have a finish line.
Thus we cannot say for sure that eCommerce technology is fully developed and
requires no further advancement. However the advancement that has already
happened in this field took more than 10 years in our country. I can still
recall the days when eCommerce was in its early stage and only a very small
number of people actually knew about it. However the total number of online
merchants, customers, and online transactions per day is quite huge now.

Advancement of eCommerce technology has had an ample effect on the mass
people, online store owners and on the overall trade and business in our
country. There are scarcely any businesses here that do not have some short of
online presence. The eCommerce is no longer an option, it has become a must.
The way people purchase their daily necessities or the way merchants reach to
the customers have changed dramatically.

Without online presence business cannot stay in competition these days. Many
small business owners have tap into the eCommerce world and gained brand
popularity and have enhanced their business opportunities to a large extent.
Stores are no longer restricted in a physical location with fixed business
hours. On line stores are now open 24/7 and reach people anywhere in the
country or beyond the borders. The number of online shops is rapidly
increasing and those stores have gained their popularity among the citizens of
our country. In many cases those stores do not have a particular physical shop
and this has all been possible only because of the advancement of eCommerce
technology. People no longer need to visit a shop to purchase a product. They
can virtually order any product from anywhere and get it delivered in few
hours. The purchase, payment and delivery are all connected via secured
connections and it is a revolutionary way of selling and purchasing products
and services.

###  IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.

##  Describe a city or a town where you live or lived.

**You should say:**

  * where it is located
  * what part of it you are most familiar with
  * what are the important landmarks and places there

**and explain what makes that city or town special to you.**

**Sample Answer:**  
I am originally from Nepal and I have spent most of my life at Kathmandu,
which is my place of birth. However during my graduation period I had to live
in Dhaka, which is the capital city of Bangladesh, and is a wonderful city. I
stayed in this city for about 5 years and this is the city I would talk about
for my cue card topic.

According to the official map, Dhaka is located in the middle of Bangladesh.
Dhaka is a small city but it is quite crowed and busy. Set beside the
Buriganga River Dhaka city has an area of 315 square mile. In the 17th
century, Dhaak was the Mughal capital of Bengal and it still has many old
architectural works and buildings of this era.

I stayed in the Dhaka University campus which is near the Shahbagh area and
this is the area I was most familiar with. To be honest this is a spectacular
and lively city and the rich tradition and Bengali culture makes it a unique
city. There are a lot of famous and important landmarks in this city including
Lalbagh Fort, Liberation War Museum, Ahsan Manzil, Sonargaon, National Museum,
National Parliament House, War memorial monument, Sixty Dome Mosque and so on.
Interestingly I have visited all of these significant landmarks in Dhaka
except Sixty Dome Mosque. I personally enjoyed visiting the Ahsan Manzil,
Sonargaon and War memorial monument. The old Dhaka is a unique place with old
and traditional buildings and distinctive life-style of people. The university
campus was another fascinating place for me. I often went to the new market
for shopping and Nilkhet was a very popular place for book lovers.

I believe that the university years are quite memorable and pleasant years for
everyone. In fact I had some of the best years of my life while I was in my
university. I spent those golden years in this very city and made many good
friends during this time. The friendly people, colourful festival, pleasant
memory, comfortable weather and my exposure to a different culture are the
reasons I will never forget this city. This will always be a city I would love
to visit and my pleasant time in this city makes it very special to me.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 422 - Your favourite means of transport

transport&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

###  IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.

##  Describe your favourite means of transport.

**You should say:**

  * What it is
  * when and how often you use it
  * why you use it

**And explain why it is your favourite transport.**

**Model Answer: **  
Favourite means of transport?  That’s easy!  I love going off on adventures,
and there is one particular form of transport that I strongly associate with
starting off on a voyage of discovery.  I wonder if you will feel the same way
about it, or whether you might think I’m a bit odd for thinking about it in
such a romantic way!

I’ll tell you what it is, when and how often I use it as well as why, and try
to convey to you why it is my favourite way to travel, even if the reality
isn’t always as magical as my imagination would like it to be.

My favourite means of transport is the train!  I don’t really use the train
all that often, but that is part of the attraction.  For day to day getting
about town I tend to walk, or use the local bus, or if there is no public
transport where I want to go then I’ll take my car.  However, if I’m heading
off further afield I always like to take the train, so that might be just a
few times a year, and always for a longish journey – perhaps three hours if
I’m going to London, but a lot longer if I was travelling right up to Scotland
for example.

I use the train for lots of reasons.  The practical reasons are that it is
usually a comfortable way to travel as long as you go off peak.  (I DO NOT
enjoy being packed on a commuter train in the rush hour – that is a completely
different railway experience).  In cars or coaches I can get a bit travel sick
if I’m a passenger, but there is something soothing about the trundle of a
train.  I never feel ill journeying that way.  Trains are also reasonably
efficient at getting you from city to city towards your final destination, and
you don’t have to worry about getting stuck in traffic, so although it can be
an expensive way to get about, it is always reassuring that you will probably
get to wherever you are going on time to say catch your flight or make your
meeting appointment.

Those are the practical reasons, but there are more emotional reasons why I
like train travel.  It is the anticipation you get sitting on a train, heading
for a maybe new city, or to get a plane to an unknown destination and you
start to think about all the exciting possibilities ahead.  It is the first
step into the unknown of travel, and it makes you feel alive!  Then, there is
the joy of seeing new scenery unfolds as the train passes through towns,
cities, countryside.  Even if the route is familiar, it will always look
different on any day depending on the time of year, the weather, the time of
day.  You get little snapshots of other people’s lives as you can see into
their back gardens, watch them walking through the countryside, or even (if
I’m honest) peering into their houses.  The view from the train window may not
always be beautiful, but it will always be interesting.  Depending on my mood,
I like to look at the other passengers, and imagine what their stories and
destinations might be.  Some traveling alone like me, may be carrying
suitcases or backpacks and will be going off on holiday somewhere.  There
might be others wearing suits and clutching briefcases trying to get to
important work meetings.  Screeching groups of friends could be on their way
to a reunion or party, and then there are quieter couples of individuals who
might be going to the shops, visiting a friend or family member in hospital.
I like it when you see gangs who are clearly on their way to the same
destination such as a day at the races (all wearing enormous hats and ‘posh’
clothes that would normally be out of place in the middle of the day).
Sometimes it might be fans going to a concert or people from one particular
profession heading to a work conference.  I try and guess where they are all
heading.

Amongst this throng of fellow travellers, you sometimes strike gold.  British
people have a reputation for not talking on trains, and generally this is
true.  You do have to be a bit careful about how you read other people’s body
language before you strike up a conversation.  However, sometimes something
will happen – the train is delayed, or you have to talk to each other as you
are finding your reserved seat, and then to coin a phrase you’ve ‘broken the
ice’ and talk flows.  I’ve had some of the best conversations and experiences
of my life talking to strangers on a train.  I have a theory that if you are
talking to people you will probably never see again, you can be honest and
direct in a way you would never risk in ‘normal’ chit chat.  I can recall a
few.  One day I was on a train that was delayed for several hours due to an
accident on the track ahead.  Probably a suicide I think, although the
announcements were a bit vague.  This delay led to me having a really profound
talk with the woman alongside me.  We discussed quite literally attitudes to
life and death, personal experiences of dealing with family illnesses, and
notions of identity.  We also had much more light-hearted conversation about
fashion malfunctions and embarrassing stories about ourselves!  We talked for
hours, but at the end of our journey said our goodbyes and I don’t even know
her name.  I’ve had other amazing conversations too, one with a guy who
claimed to provide personal banking services to millionaires – I’m sure it
wasn’t true, but it was fascinating hearing him tell his tales ‘in confidence’
trying to impress me.  On another occasion I met an elderly women who said
she’d been a spy in the war – doubtful, but great to hear her stories all the
same.  Then there was the youngish man who chose me to unburden his soul to
about his relationship problems with his girlfriend.  I was surprised by the
intimacy of his disclosures, but nosy enough to listen to it all anyway!

So trains are great.   They not only take you to glorious destinations, they
are in themselves a snapshot of the world.  If you are cautiously open enough
to engage with others around you, you can gain insights into other worlds and
experiences.  You might even get some good advice along the way!

Sadly, not all train experiences are like this.  Some are crowded,
exasperating, squashed up against the armpits of others, getting increasingly
annoyed at the fumes from the overflowing loo and being angry at the noisiness
of drunken youths a few seats down.  On those journeys I try to close my eyes,
concentrate on the rhythmic rocking of the train and imagine myself back on
one of my more life-affirming journeys.  Maybe next time I get on a train it
will be like that all over again!

teacher&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

###  IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.

##  Describe someone you know who is a good teacher.

**You should say:**

  * who this person is
  * how you know him/her
  * what kind of subjects he /she teaches.

**and explain why you think this person is a good teacher.**

**Sample Answer: **  
I can think of a great teacher.  Her name is Dawn, I know her because I go to
her weekly community fitness class, and I’m going to tell you just exactly why
I think she is not just a good teacher, but a really great one!

Dawn is essentially a fitness instructor.  There are lots of fitness
instructors in the world, but she is unusual in her approach and enthusiasm.
She works in the community, so I know her because once a week I attend a class
she runs in a cold community hall in a relatively deprived part of the city
where I live.  Her post is funded as some sort of a health initiative, so the
class is subsidised, that means it only costs me £1 (one pound) to attend,
which is very cheap.  Most exercise classes near me are between six to fifteen
pounds an hour, depending on what you do.

I’m not a natural at exercise, I know it’s good for me to keep me healthy, but
I’ve never before looked forward to going to an exercise class.  Dawn’s
sessions are different. On one level, it is a very ordinary session.  There
are a few movements to music based on dance steps; some stretching; and then
typically a bit of floor work on mats that’s a little like yoga and supposedly
helps you to develop your abdominal muscles (core).  The one hour session
concludes with some stretching to cool down.  The music plays on a tinny old
cassette tape machine with terrible sound quality.  The hall is light but
freezing cold, and the venue a bit tucked away.  It oughtn’t to be as much fun
as it is.

This fitness instructor is in my view a wonderful teacher because she is
funny, enthusiastic, motivational and knowledgeable.  It is a very rare
combination indeed.  The class is very diverse, with a wide age range from
probably women in their mid-twenties perhaps on maternity leave, through to
self-employed people in their middle age, right through to pensioners who are
quite definitely in their late seventies and possibly in their eighties.  They
may be game and feisty, but they aren’t in their first flush of youth!
Despite the broad age range, backgrounds and ability, Dawn includes everyone.
She is a gifted facilitator to cater for such a broad range of people within
one group session.  She knows us all by name, she watches our technique to
make sure everyone is safe and getting the most out of the session, but she is
positive and encouraging.  The class is full of laughter and support.  She
tells funny stories to distract us, and keeps the exercises moving quickly
from one to another so there is never any chance to get bored.  She is also
ridiculously encouraging.  The way she praises us for our efforts you would
imagine we could all be professional dances or gymnasts if we wanted to, our
talent is limitless!  As a teacher, she creates an environment where we are
all confident to try new things, and test our fitness.  If we make mistakes,
she just laughs, and breaks down the sequence into smaller sections, until
everyone is confident with what we are supposed to be doing.  She gently
advises on technique so that over the short period of time I’ve been attending
her classes I feel my knowledge of fitness theory has developed alongside my
actual stamina.  I wish she did a class every day – there would be no stopping
me then!

A good teacher is a rare thing indeed.  Knowing your subject may be a
necessary pre-requisite for teaching but it is not enough in itself.  Having a
teacher who can engage, inspire and motivate is what really matters.  All of
us in the class want to do our best for Dawn, and in doing so, we achieve the
best for ourselves as well.

you&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

###  IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.

##  Describe a relative/ friend / family member who you think is similar to
you.

**You should say:**

  * who he/she is
  * what he/she does
  * what others think about him/her

**And explain how he/ she is similar to you.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Well people often say that I have many striking resemblances with my elder
brother John. If I have to choose someone whom I consider to be like me, I
would also choose my brother john. His full name is Alfred John and he is 4
years senior to me. He is an architect and working as a project lead in a
large international organization for the last couple of years.

His physical appearance, height, body structure and complexion are quite
similar to mine. I can recall two/three events when a distant relative thought
I was John. People often make this mistake especially when I wear formal
dresses (like my brother most of the time does) and they look at me from a
reasonable distance.

Apart from the remarkable outer similarities between us, we have many common
interests and similar way of thinking. We like the same type of foods, music,
movies and sports. We are in fact really good buddy when we play together or
compete others. We have common interests like our passion for gardening,
reading, travelling and collecting coins. We both love to learn new
technologies and that’s make us common minded. Sometimes he gave his opinion
in many family and political issues that I found were quite the reflection of
my thoughts.

To my parents and others, he is a great human being and an example of an ideal
son. Apart from my mother others think that he is quite exceptionally
brilliant! My mother still considers him as a fragile kid who needs here
affection and advice to survive.

I consider him as a brother only lucky people can have! To me he is a fried, a
mentor and an example in life. The most important similarity I wish to possess
is the morality and kindness he has for others.

####  If you can talk about this cue card, you should be able to answer the
following cue card topics as well:

1\. Describe one of your family members.  
2\. Describe one of your brothers or sisters.  
3\. Describe a person you admire.  
4\. Describe a person you find exemplary.  
5\. Talk about someone you like very much.  
6\. Describe a good friend you have.  
7\. Talk about a person who is kind to others.  
8\. Describe a quality you admire.  
9\. Describe a person who motivates you.  
10\. Describe someone you often spend time with.

Oh no!  I’m embarrassed talking about this topic, because I’m so good at time
wasting I’ve almost turned it into an art form, and that’s terrible isn’t it.
I do my best time wasting when I’ve got something important to do, but which I
keep putting off, so I’ll procrastinate by doing lots of things that aren’t
really essential, but distract me from what I should be doing.  I tell myself
I’ll work better on that essay if I just tidy my desk/ have something to eat/
make that phone call first!  Does that sound familiar to you?  Still, even the
sorts of things you do when procrastinating might be useful, that desk could
have needed tidying and that phone call did need to be made. The worst sort of
time wasting has no side off benefit at all.  OK, so I can think of a great
example of this!  I’ll tell you the what, when and why – I think it will be
obvious without explanation that it was indeed, a complete waste of time!

So I was lucky enough to be traveling, and I’d stopped off at a Youth Hostel
in Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe.  It was humid and hot and I was exhausted.
Even so, here I was in an amazing location, and I just didn’t have the energy
to go outside.  It was off season, and also, for various reasons Zimbabwe has
lost some of its appeal to tourists in recent years, so it was very quiet.
Lots of the guest houses and attractions were run down and shut, and the place
felt a bit on edge.  I was alone at the guest house, and decided I’d just
relax by watching TV for a bit.  Now, there wasn’t much in the way of English
language stations, so I ended up stumbling on a Kung Fu film with English sub-
titles.  It was an old film, and really badly made, what’s more is, I don’t
even like Kung Fu films!  Even so, I sat through it for about 2 hours, then
just at the critical point where the film plot was coming to its somewhat
laboured conclusion, the screen went blank, and then the film restarted right
at the beginning!  I couldn’t believe it.  I’d just sat there for over 2
hours, watching a terrible movie, and I didn’t even get to see the end!

So the ‘what’ was watching not quite all of a terrible made-for-TV martial
arts film; the ‘when’ was whilst I should have been exploring an amazing new
location on arriving at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe; as for the ‘why’?  Well, I
don’t know really what possessed me!  I was tired, and I thought it would be
good to relax a bit, but I so regretted it.

I felt so cross with myself afterwards.  Life is short, I would probably never
be in this part of the world again, I should have gone out exploring and
caught up on relaxation and sleep later.  It had been cripplingly hot it’s
true, but it had also been bright sunshine through the humidity.  I should
have gone to see the infamous waterfalls that afternoon, the light would have
been perfect for creating rainbows.  As it was, I went the next morning when
it was cooler, but very overcast, not a rainbow in sight.  I am still furious
with myself for missing that wonder of the world for a bad film.

So do I need to spell out any more why it was a complete waste of time?  I
missed the chance to see a spectacular set of waterfalls in what would have
been perfect light for generating the multitude of rainbows for which that
stretch of water is particularly famous.  Not only did I miss out on this
because I was watching a terrible film, it was a terrible film which I didn’t
even get to see the end of!  Lesson learned.  Sometimes however tired you
feel, or lacking in energy, if an opportunity comes your way seize it, it
might not come round again, and time wasted, isn’t time you will ever get
back!

**Sample Answer 2:**  
Last year I bought a book on wood crafting as I thought I would learn and make
some fabulous designs from simple wood. The idea came from a documentary I
watched on TV and I thought buying a book and then trying it at home would be
a good way to learn this skill. But to my dismay that turned out to be a very
difficult task for me and I lost my interest in few days. The whole thing was
a waste of time in my opinion.

I thought reading this book would actually help me learning how to make simple
designs from wood and it must be easy to follow. But to my surprise, the book
focused too much on history of wood crafting rather than presenting how to
create one. I must have picked up the wrong book!

Then I watched some videos online and tried to mimic them. It would be
probably early March last year when I tried this. I had an exam in July and
yet I spent more than 3 weeks trying to learn this skill. I did it out of
curiosity than passion and that might have been the main reason I lost my
interest quite soon.

I spent many days and more than 400 dollars to arrange everything I required
to successfully create a beautiful wood craft. However, I picked the off-topic
book and had not tried very hard. The whole process taught me nothing and cost
me a good amount of money. This is why I consider it a complete waste of time,
specially, since I did it before an important exam I had. That was very
disappointing for me.

learned&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a skill you have learned that you think is very useful.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * where and when you learned it
  * how you use it

**and explain why you think this skill is so useful.**

**Sample Answer:**  
I can speak Spanish and I consider it as a very useful skill. My mother tongue
is not Spanish and it was not even my second language in our school. However I
learned it during my three year stay with my grandmother in Spain. My
grandmother got me admitted in a local school and I learned this language
there. After I returned Italy, my homeland, I always practice Spanish with
some of my friends from Spain. The comprehensive online language learning
materials and reference websites also helped me learning this language.

Well, I use Spanish to talk to my grandparents and three cousins I have in
Spain. I also read Spanish story books and novels recommended one of my
university teachers who is from Spain. Most importantly, I use my skill to
translate some of the web page contents as a freelance translator and this
brings a good earning for me. I have left the part-time job I was doing in a
large grocery shop and now I work solely on the translation jobs online.

I believe that learning a new language and actually being able to use it is a
great skill. It enables us to know about a different culture and thus enhances
our overall understanding of the diverse cultural aspects of various nations
throughout the world. My skill in Spanish language enables me to make new
friends, read books written in another language and understand a different
nation and their cultural aspects. Another important use of this skill is my
freelancing job. I work as a translator from and to Italian, English and
Spanish and I enjoy this job while earn some money per month. In short, I
would say that this skill is quite helpful and handy to me.

  * who you invited

**and explain why you invited the person(s) to have a meal.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Well, for this cue card topic I would like to talk about a buffet meal I
arranged in a restaurant where I invited 5 of my colleges few months ago.

I invited 5 colleagues from my office who are very close to me and indeed nice
co-workers to work with. They helped me a lot in many events and all of them
are very friendly. When I was promoted to a senior executive in my current
office few months back, I thought to treat some of my colleges and I naturally
chose these five persons. They were John, Eric, Stephen, Anny and Bikash.

I threw this treat in the ‘Royal Case Inn’ that offers the best buffet meals
in the town. This place was only 20 minutes away from our office and we had
our lunch there on Monday. The restaurant was in the 18th floor and we went
there at around 12:45 pm together from our office.

There were plenty of food items for us which were included in our buffet lunch
menu. I can recall more than 30 items were presented in the restaurant for the
customers.

We ate different food items based on our own choices and tastes. Some of the
items which we all ate were Thai soup, fried rice, mixed salad, mutton curry,
gravy fish items, opinion mixed fish and ice cream.

 Usually it is a common practice in our office to treat others whenever
someone gets promoted. As soon as I got the confirmation letter about the
promotion from the higher management, those colleges congratulated me and
reminded me the treat. I was very happy to have been promoted as a senior
executing in this multination company and threw this meal to celebrate.

**If you prepare for this cue card you should be able to answer the following cue cards as well:**

  * Describe a restaurant you like to visit.
  * Talk about a meal you enjoyed outside your home.
  * Describe a meal you enjoyed recently.

  * Describe a party or treat you threw for others.
  * Describe a restaurant in your city that you would recommend others.
  * Describe a famous restaurant in your area.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a happy family event from your childhood that you remember well.

**You should say:**

  * what the event was
  * when and where it happened
  * what you saw or did

**and explain why you remember this event so well.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Well, this is a very nice topic for me and I would love to talk about one of
my most memorable childhood events that I had with my family members.  
The celebration was to welcome a new guest in our family- my nephew who was
born on that day. My eldest sister gave birth of a beautiful and healthy baby
boy on that particular day. I was around 8 years old then.

After my father saw the newborn baby for the first time, he declared that this
is very special occasion for us. As this is the first baby in our family, he
decided that the occasion must be celebrated to welcome the new guest in our
family. The event and the celebration both took place in our house which is in
Dunville.

As soon as my father affirmed that we would celebrate this very special day,
everyone of our family got busy for the arrangement. My parents went to invite
guests and to do some necessary shopping. I was so happy and excited that I
also called some of my friends to enjoy the event. I wanted to be near the new
born baby all the time and when my mother told me to give some time to the
mother and baby alone, I felt quite sad and depressed. I could not believe
that such a beautiful baby is my nephew and I wanted to touch him and play
with him all the time. However the sad feeling was so momentary in this case
and I forgot it in few minutes. Then I started playing and gossiping with my
friends who by the meantime have come to visit us.

It was a different day – in terms of happiness, amazement and celebration. The
arrival of a gorgeous baby and a huge celebration to welcome the event brought
us unbound happiness and reasons to smile. My mother, with her sister, cooked
many delicious dishes and we enjoyed the foods with so many friends and
relatives. The large cake that my elder brother bought from a pastry shop was
another delight and surprise for us.

This was a very happy event for all our family members, close friends,
neighbours and relatives. I still remember this special family event very
vividly for the immense joy and happiness it brought for us.

or-relative&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a handmade gift you gave to a friend or relative.

**You should say:**

  * what the gift was
  * who you gave it to and when
  * how you made it by hand

**and explain why you gave a handmade gift to your this friend or relative.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Thank you a lot for this topic. I will talk about a handmade gift that I gave
to my younger sister when she was only 7 and how I actually made it.

Well, the gift was a wooden doll (I must confess that doll did not look that
great as I made it when I was only 15 years old and I had little skills making
such things). Yet my sister loved it so much and I felt so proud for making
this gift for her. It was a late winter evening probably in 2001 when I took
my sister to the market to buy her a pair of shoes. On our way back to home
she showed me a large doll displayed in a fancy toy shop. She told me that she
would love to own a doll like that. She knew the price of that doll would be
really high and I did not have enough money to actually buy her that doll.

This event sadden me a lot and I asked my father, who lived in a different
city for his job to buy her a doll. He probably forgot about the doll and did
not send any doll in next two weeks. My sister’s birthday was approaching and
I wanted to make her a beautiful doll before her birthday. I used to make
boat, wooden pen, and other type of toys in my childhood as a passion but
making a doll was something I never thought I would do someday. However, I
dared to make one and worked for more than 7-8 days to finally make something
that I could claim as a doll. I took a fine quality wood large enough to give
it a shape of a doll, used other tools, glue and other ingredients to make
this doll. I painted that doll and tried to mimic my sister’s facial features
in this doll. When I gave this doll to my sister, she was so amazed that she
kissed me and thanked me again and again. She even recognized that I tried to
mimic her face in that doll. Then I told her that ‘the name of this doll is
Emmy’. She laughed and told me that it was even more beautiful than her.

Few weeks later my father bought her a very expensive and beautiful doll but
my sister was somehow convinced that the one I made was prettier. May be that
was because of her love and affection for me.

I basically wanted to make my sister happy and to give her something before
her 8th birthday. I did not have enough money to buy her a big doll and I had
some skills on making toys with woods and papers. Considering all these facts
I was convinced that I should make a wooden doll by myself for my sister.

**If you prepare for this cue card you should be able to answer the following cue cards as well:**

  * Describe something you made by your own hand.
  * Describe a gift you gave to someone.
  * Describe a birthday gift you gave to someone.
  * Describe a memorable event from your teen age.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something that you shared with others (or another person).

**You should say:**

  * what you shared
  * when you shared it
  * who you shared it with

**and explain why you shared it and how you felt when you shared it.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Thank you very much for this wonderful topic. I believe human is a social
being and we need to share so many things with our relatives, friends and
unknown persons in different occasions. I will talk about a time when I shared
my room with one of my cousins who suddenly visited our house few months ago.

I have my personal room where I usually live along. We have two guests room
and that’s why I have never shared my room with anyone who stays our house at
night. Few months ago when my cousin came to visit our home, we were
renovating our second floor and that’s why we had no spare room for the
guests. My cousin, Stephen, came to our town all of a sudden and informed us
that he would need to stay in our town for couple of days. He also informed
that he is planning to stay in a hotel. My father insisted him to stay with us
and I thought I could easily share my room with him for couple of days. He was
2 years younger to me but we had a friendly relationship from our childhood.

Stephen stayed two nights in our house and I shared my room, bed and bathroom
with him so that he can stay in our house comfortably. We talked about our
grandparents, other cousins, our works and future plans. I enjoyed his company
and we had good times together. I am not habituated to share my very personal
belongings and rooms with others, but sharing it with my one of the most
favourite cousins was not a bad experience at all. In fact during his stay we
had so many funs that I invited him to visit our house again.

**If you prepare for this cue card you should be able to answer the following cue cards as well:**

  * Describe one of your cousins or friends.
  * Describe a guest who stayed your house for a couple of days.
  * Describe an event when you had to share your room with someone else.
  * An event when you shared something with one of your relatives.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a news story you have read or heard about recently.

**You should say:**

  * what it was about
  * when you heard / read it
  * what you thought about the news story

**and explain why you remember this news story.**

**Sample Answer:**  
This is a really nice topic and I would love to talk about a news story I read
recently. In fact last month I read a news story in a magazine which was about
the contributions of women scientists in the human history. It was a
fascinating and educative news story and the whole article was quite
informative.

I am not sure about the exact date but my best assumption is 10-14 May was the
time when I read the news story in the magazine. The magazine that covered
this news story is a monthly Science &amp; Technology magazine called ‘Tech-
World’.

I thought this was a very intriguing news story and it was a good read. I
found it quite informative and the way the writer presented the news-story was
outstanding. This news story tells the readers about the life, work and
contributions of Marie Curie, Rosalind Franklin, Rachel Carson, Ada Lovelace,
Alice Wilson and many other famous scientists as well as about many little
known women scientists. I found it quite captivating as it covered an
interesting topic. Though we know about some famous female scientists, but
contributions of other less known female scientists towards the enhancement of
science was not known to me.

Honestly, I knew very little about women scientists and their invaluable
researches and works for science except Marie Curie and Rosalind Franklin.
This news story presented how women in history have contributed for the
advancement of science and their sacrifices were remarkable and should never
be forgotten. The topic itself was very enthralling and the way the story was
presented was quite unique. I remember this news-story possibly because of its
interesting topic and outstanding description. I think such news story should

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a subject you didn’t like before but have interest in now.

**You should say:**

  * what subject it was
  * when you studied the subject
  * why you didn’t like it before

**and explain why you have interest in it now.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Accounting is the subject that I find very interesting these days though I did
not like it when I had to study it in my university level. I have finished my
graduation in Computer Science major and we had Accounting part 1 and part 2
in our second year; 5th and 6th semesters. Thought Accounting was an important
subject for us, I had very little interest in it. This was possibly because my
misconception that it is only important for Commerce and Business Studies
students. I studied accounting subject only to pass my course and also missed
few classes. Thus I failed to enter into the interesting world of accounting
and that’s why disliked this subject.

Science had always been major and I was never introduced with the accounting
subject in my pre-university level. The teacher who took our accounting
classes did not introduce us with the basic concept of accounting. Moreover he
went through chapters so quickly that I missed it completely. As a result when
the teacher explained the advanced concepts of accounting, I was completely
lost. For all these reasons I was weak in accounting and this formed the
disliking in me until the very recent time.

Well, the reason I like accounting these days is quite interesting. After I
started working as a Software Engineer in a multinational company, I worked in
various projects. A year ago I was assigned to a project that required me to
develop an accounting software for an Australian company. Ironically I had to
study many accounting books and tutorials to understand how I should implement
the concepts and calculation in this software. I also attended few training
sessions organised by our office related to accounting and banking concepts.
Once I understood the basic and interesting part of this subject, I actually
started enjoying it a lot. The project took around 8 months to be delivered to
the client and I was kind of forced to study and discuss a lot of accounting
concepts during this period. Once I started understanding the fundamental
concepts and its application in the real world, this subject became one of my
favourite subjects.

life&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an important year in your life.

**You should say:**

  * when it was
  * what happened in this year
  * how old you were then

**and explain why it is an important year in your life.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Well, picking an important year was bit header as so many important events
took place in different years in my life. However, among them I would like to
talk about the year 2002 which I consider as one of the most important years
in my life.

I went to visit my uncle’s house in the year 2000 and stayed there about three
weeks. During my visit I learned a lesson that has changed my perspective
about my life and that was probably the most significant turning point in my
life. I was 16 years old then.

While staying there I went to the sea beach, which was about 5 kilometers away
from my uncle’s house, with one of my cousins. We went their without informing
our guardians and thought that we would return before the dusk without anyone
noticing. While swimming in the sea water, we were enjoying a lot and the big
tides of the sea made our experience more enthralling. All of a sudden I
noticed that the sands below my feet were no longer presents and at the same
time a giant tide hit me. I was quite afraid and was again hit by a giant tide
from the reverse direction. That tide took me a long away from the beach and I
was really frightened. I am a good swimmer but at that very moment my body
froze in terror and I could not move my muscle. I could see the anxious eyes
of distant people and for the first time in life I thought that I was going to
die. That was an experience I can’t express in words. I had no idea about the
time and many things from my childhood were flashing back in my mind. I felt
that I was drowning even after my desperate try to survive. Things were
becoming blurred and I think I started losing my conscious.

I don’t know how long I had been in this state. All of a sudden I felt like
some force was pulling me towards him and the next thing I saw were some
curious eyes strangely looking at me. I was actually rescued by some local
fishermen who were fishing nearby.

This event changed me dramatically. I started realizing the reality of life
and how fragile our life could be. It was a near death experience that taught
me the importance of life, our relationship, necessity of being humble,
prudent, responsible and all other good things an ideal human being should
possess. This year had a great influence to help me become who I really am and
how I feel about being alive. This is a lesson we experience probably once in
a life time and from that perspective the year 2000 is very important to me.

**If you prepare for this cue card you should be able to answer the following cue cards as well:**

  * Describe an important event in your life.
  * Describe an event when you learned a good lesson.
  * Describe a frightening experience you have in your life.
  * Describe a time when someone helped you.
  * Describe a memorable event in your life.

magazines&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe one of your favourite newspapers/ magazines.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * how much each copy costs
  * how often you read it

**and explain why you like it so much.**

**Sample Answer:**  
My favourite newspaper is ‘The Daily Mail’ and it is a daily newspaper with
more than 20 million readers per day. I have been reading this newspaper for
the last seven years and it is quite popular in our country.

As a daily newspaper it is comparatively cheaper. Each copy costs a dollar and
it was 40 cents few years back. Some special editions sometimes cost few cents
more than usual price.

I read this newspaper almost every day. In the morning when I eat my
breakfast, I love to read this newspaper. I also read it in the evening. The
fine print, committed journalism, news presentation and authenticity of news
are the most important aspects I like about his newspaper. I like their
editorial part the most and the in depth analysis of their journalists and
editor is really good. This newspaper has comprehensive sections on
international news, sports, business and political news. The way the
journalist and the news analysts present news and analysis is quite remarkable
and they seem like to be the only newspaper that still maintains the write
journalism.

As a reader I have compared this newspaper with many others and I have always
decided to continue reading it. I feel like the news and coverage of this
newspaper is not biased and whenever I read something, I can be sure of the
authenticity of the news. This makes me stick to this newspaper for a long.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 452 - A time when you stayed far away from your home

your-home&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a time when you stayed far away from your home.

**You should say:**

  * when and where it was
  * how long you stayed there
  * why you stayed there and what you did there

**and explain how you felt about staying far away from home.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Till I turned to 16, I can’t recall any even when I stayed far away from home
alone. Though I visited some of my relatives who stayed far away from our
living place, but in all those occasions either of my parents, or both them
were with me. For this cue card topic I will talk about an event when I stayed
far away from my home, where I went, how long I stayed there and my feelings
about staying far away from home.

I went to Denmark when I was 19 years old as part of a tour that our college
arranged. That was a 7 day-tour to explore a different country. I went to
Denmark and stayed in a hotel that our college booked for us.

As I remember I stayed there for about 7 days and that was indeed my first
stay in a place quite far away from my home. The day we reached there, I was
quite fascinated to be in a different country. We reached there in the evening
and checked in a hotel. I got a small single room where I stayed for 4 days.
After we move to Odense in South Denmark, we stayed in a different hotel but
this time I had to share the room with one of my classmates and luckily the
room was large enough for two of us to share.  
We did numerous things during our stay including visiting museums, camping,
completing an assignment, visiting two other colleges in Denmark and meeting
with the students there and visiting different historically significant places
in Denmark. Some of the experiences, including dining, visiting local markets
and meeting local people were some distinctive experiences for me.

I would say I was very excited about the whole tour and everything we did and
participated in were very enthralling. This was the first time I stayed so
long in a distant place without any family members. I called my parents almost
every day and I missed them quite often. They were worried for me and called
me now and then to learn what I was doing and whether everything was okay or
not. I missed my own room, my little sister and parents but that did not made
me homesick due to the stirring experience and time I was having.

I did not feel how much I missed my house, parents and little sisters until I
returned home as seeing all of them and getting back to my own house gave me a
unique feeling I never felt before. It was like getting back to a place and
people I love most.

**If you prepare for this cue card you should be able to answer the following cue cards as well:**

  * Describe a city or country you have visited.
  * Describe a time when you stayed in a hotel.
  * Describe a tour or journey that you remember.
  * Talk about an event when you missed your house and relatives.
  * Describe a city or country you have been to.
  * Describe an educational tour you have had.
  * Describe a memorable even from your school or college.
  * Describe a city or country would like to visit.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a situation when you received some useful advice.

**You should say:**

  * what the situation was
  * who gave you the advice
  * what the advice was

**and explain how this advice was useful to you.**

**Sample Answer:**  
I was bit confused while picking the situation when I received some useful
advice from others and finally I decided to talk about the advice I got from
my father when I was in my early teen age.

There was no particular situation or reason my father gave me those advices.
In one evening I was sitting near him and watching TV. I was then 14 years old
and was very fond of quiz shows. Both of us were enjoying the programme and
few minutes later my father asked me about my school. That was bit
embarrassing to talk about since my recent exam result was disappointing. He
then told me some fascinating stories from his childhood and how he felt about
school, study and other stuffs. My father has a natural talent of telling
compelling stories or maybe I love his stories because I like him very much.
At one point I was so amazed to learn that he was very much like me and had
more passion on playing, hanging out with friends than studying. He then
explained me the importance of studying very attentively and how my academic
performance will determine my future. If the advice had not been received from
my father, I might have taken it very lightly. But when he told me how he had
changed himself and achieved excellence in his academic results and how that
has helped him to achieve a career he always dreamt about, I took it very
seriously. The best point about this conversation was that I did not feel like
I was being lectured or intentionally delivered some good advices. I thought
about what my father advised me and I was really captivated about the idea
that my academic excellence can someday make me a person I want to be. I was
really enthralled about what I want to be in the future and my father’s advice
made it clear to me that I will have to study hard to achieve this in my life.

I won’t say I have achieved an excellent academic record, but this advice
helped me to become interested about learning. Things could have been quite
different for me if I did not receive those advices in proper time. This is
the reason I consider it as the best advice I have ever received from anyone.
This advice grew the interest of reading and learning in me and that’s the
best part in my life so far.

**If you prepare for this cue card you should be able to answer the following cue cards as well:**

  * Describe an important conversation you had with someone.
  * Describe a useful advice you received from someone.
  * Describe a time or event that changed your life.
  * Describe someone who had a great influence on you.

life&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a subject that helped you in life, even though you didn’t like it
in school.

**You should say:**

  * what the subject was
  * do you like it now? why?
  * why didn’t you like it in school?

**and explain how it helped you in your life. **

**Model Answer 1: **  
Hindsight is a wonderful thing isn’t it?  Sometimes over time you come to
completely change your mind about something, even though you never could have
imagined you would.  It’s the same for me a subject I spent some time studying
when I was younger, and I absolutely loathed it.  Now, I realise that subject
– or more accurately skill – is one of my strongest assets, it has definitely
helped me in life, in more ways than I could possibly have realised at the
time.

So I’ll explain what the subject is, what I think about it now and why …
together with how that’s changed from when I was first learning it, and then
I’ll try and explain how it has helped me in life, but that could take a
while!

Strictly speaking, this wasn’t a topic I learned at school, but after I left
it.  I enrolled at a local college because they were offering a free
‘Intensive Secretarial Course’ and at the time I didn’t have a job so I
thought it would be something worthwhile to learn whilst I was doing some
volunteering and looking for proper work.  The course was many years ago,
believe it or not, this was before the internet, and even before networked
computers!   The course covered typing and shorthand, and also how to lay out
business letters properly.  Truthfully, I never got the hang of shorthand.
The lessons were after lunch and after a few weeks I stopped going to those
sessions as I found that ‘accidentally on purpose’ they clashed with my
volunteering…  I did however persevere with typing.  Now I can touch type with
ease, far faster than I could write anything, and just as fast as I can think.
I don’t know that I ‘like’ it exactly, it has become as natural to me as
breathing.  I just couldn’t imagine being without this skill, it is so, so
useful.

Why didn’t I like studying it at the time?  Where to begin.  It was just so
boring and repetitive.  What’s more, I learned how to type using a manual
typewriter, banging out nonsensical phrases on what would now seem to be
ancient machines.  You had to hit the keys quite fiercely or they wouldn’t
strike the inked ribbon hard enough to leave a mark.  If you weren’t careful
you could actually get your fingers caught between the metal keys.  Uurgh, it
was horrible!  If you made a mistake using carbon paper (that’s the inked
paper you used to have to place in between clean sheets if you were making
more than one copy of a document) you had to carefully wind out the paper from
the machine, ease the pages apart and using liquid paper corrector paint over
the mistakes in ever document. It was incredibly fiddly and frustrating.  The
shorthand classes were even worse!  We had to practise taking dictation from a
very serious looking woman who read from an archaic book with rather old-
fashioned ideas about how women should behave in the workplace.  I remember
one phrase was ‘and don’t forget ladies, when dressing for the office, your
nail varnish, shoes, handbag and other accessories should always match!’  I
was horrified.  Is that all women were supposed to be?  Ornaments for the
office?  No wonder I stopped going to those classes.

The funny thing is, although the course felt like the longest 6 months of my
life at the time, it was also fantastically useful.  Being able to type helped
me straight away both in looking for work and performing once appointed.  I
could do everything from being able to create my own professional looking CV,
complete smart looking application forms and was able to write up my own
reports and letters without secretarial support once I started working.  This
made me a much quicker and more independent worker than my non-typing
colleagues.  Later on, when computers were introduced, I was way faster than
others replying to emails.  They were straining over a keyboard picking out
the letters one by one, whereas I could touch type comfortably at 70 words a
minute!  I also found knowing how to produce professionally presented reports
and documents gave me a great advantage not only in time, but in how my work
was perceived.  The only down side was, that I became much more comfortable
typing than writing by hand, my hand writing got worse and worse from that
point on, now it is barely legible at all!

Nowadays touch typing has enabled me to keep a number of blogs, carry on
correspondence with people all over the world, and exchange letters with
friends and family over many years.  In a world where computers are
everywhere, I am grateful I can use a keyboard with ease.  Though I am left
wondering one thing, just as when I learned to type I could never have
anticipated how it would be so useful to me later on, I wonder if in the
future keyboards too will become a thing of the past.  Perhaps we will all
have voice activated computers and the image of me sweating over a manual
typewriter back in the eighties will seem an even stranger picture than it
already does today!

**Sample Answer 2:**  
The subject I liked the least in my school life was history and interestingly
I love to read history related books a lot these days and this subject has
helped me quite a lot in my life.

History was a mandatory subject throughout my academic years in school and
somehow I felt very less passionate about this subject at that time. After I
reached my university level, I started reading some story books that were
related to historical events in our continent and that grew a great passion in
me regarding the history. I should probably add that History channel is my
most favourite TV channels as it shows some great programmes which are not
only interesting but also great sources of knowledge and information. The main
reason I like history nowadays is because of my career as a journalist and the
valuable lessons the history can offer us. I believe that histories were made
by our ancestors and we could always learn from their great actions and
mistakes to make this world a better place to live in.

I did not like history as a subject in school probably because the teachers
failed to resent this subject in an interesting way or I was too much
interested in subjects like math, chemistry and physics. I was partially
responsible for the lack of my interest in this subject as I did not try to
get deeper inside it and I read very few books related to history by then.

The history shaped the world we live in now and every single event in history
has a great influence to change the world that we see now. From this regard I
took this subject seriously and the valuable lessons I learned from it changed
my life. For instance, after reading so many books related to wars, I have
decided not to get involved in any kind of quarrel with others as quarrels,
wars, selfishness can only bring catastrophes. I also learned about the
greatest people in human history and how their hard work, determination and
willingness have made them the exemplary persons in the worlds and how they
contributed towards a better world. The things I learned from the history
books and from other sources helped me a lot as a writer in my personal and
professional life. I would say the contribution of history as a subject or
interests have a great effect in my life.

**If you prepare for this cue card you should be able to answer the following cue cards as well:**

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an item of clothing you purchased that you didn’t like.

**You should say:**

  * what the clothing was
  * from where and why you bought it
  * what color and style it had

**and explain why you didn’t like it.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Well, that’s an interesting topic to talk about. Few months ago I purchased a
tie that I’ve never used and did not like it just after I brought it home. I
bought this tie from a street market near the city shopping mall and it cost
me around 7 dollars. In my office we are allowed to wear casual dresses on
Thursday. However we are required to wear complete formal dresses on Monday
and Tuesday and tie is mandatory on these two days in office. I purchased the
tie specifically to use it in my office.

It was a blue colour tie with vertical white stripes all over it. I have had
three ties and none of them had any stripes on it. I thought the striped tie
would add some variations to my tie collection but unfortunately I did not
like it at all. Surprisingly I liked it when I picked it from the shop but as
soon as I tried it at home, my disliking grew for it.

Since I bought it from a street market, I did not have the chance to trial it
before purchasing. I chose it as it was and after I wore it at home, I found
that it was shorter in length than usual. The making of the tie was poor and
the stripes did not match me at all. After that I thought to return it but it
was quite impossible as the street market sellers often change their
locations. Honestly speaking, I liked the colour and style of this tie but the
poor making ruined it all.

I still have this tie at home and I have no intention of wearing it ever
again. This purchasing experience taught me a valuable lesson – never purchase
an item of clothing too hastily and without actually trying it first. I will
perhaps never buy a tie from a street market.

###  Part 3: Two way discussion

_**Let's talk about clothes...**_  
1\. What kind of clothes do people in your country usually wear?  
2\. How important is it to wear fashionable clothes in your country?  
3\. Do older people and younger people wear different colored clothes?

**_Now let's talk about spending money on clothes..._**  
1\. Are clothes expensive in your country?  
2\. Do people wear more expensive clothes to work in your country?  
3\. Do you think people spend too much money on clothes nowadays?

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an interesting person you know.

**You should say:**

  * what sort of person s/he is
  * how you first met him/her
  * what s/he does for living

**and explain why you think this person is interesting.**

**Sample Answer 1:**  
Wow, this topic is tough!  Not because I don’t know anyone interesting enough,
quite the opposite.  I think everyone is interesting if you take the time to
get to know them.  It is so easy to make assumptions about people, and then
when you come to talk to them you find out all sorts of unexpected and
extraordinary things.  When I first joined my running club I thought all the
other runners had always been amazing athletes and found running easy – not
like me, I was lumbering round sweating as they sprung ahead gazelle like!
Then once I got talking to them I found many had their own stories, turning
their lives around after a setback such as illness, or obesity, everyone ran
for a reason. To spend time with friends, to get time to reflect, to enjoy the
outdoors; to improve their physical or mental health.  Every one of us is
unique and interesting.  That’s just from my running club, if I think my wider
social circle, the possibilities are endless!

So, who shall I choose?  I like people who can surprise you, who are curious
about the world, don’t judge and are confident enough in themselves to pursue
their own dreams in their own quiet way, wherever that may take them. OK, so I
know who is all of those things!  I’ll tell you what sort of person they are,
how we first met, what they do for a living and I think from all of that it
will be very obvious why they are so interesting to me!

So, this person is one of the kindest, nicest people I’ve ever met.  I can
tell you exactly when we first came across one another.  I had just relocated
to Sheffield and didn’t know a soul.  One day I went for a walk from my house
to the open countryside of the Peak District, and snow started to fall.  I
ended up at a coffee shop on an alpaca farm, quite high up.  The snow was over
a foot deep and still falling.  I went into the coffee shop and this man and
his wife were there.  He was farm manager, and she ran the coffee shop.  There
was a roaring fire in the corner and they both made me welcome, we chatted and
I dried out with a steaming hot chocolate before heading back home through the
snow.  I’d been worried about relocating on my own to a strange city, but
these people were so friendly, I felt at home, this move was going to be OK.

Some months later, I started volunteering at the farm, and I got to know Fred,
the farm manager really well.  I found out that he’d done loads of different
things in his life.  He’d travelled the world fixing x-ray machines at
airports; he’d worked as an engineer; his wife and he had had various
businesses including trading in second hand goods and antiques.  Now they’d
taken on this rural coffee shop and he was managing a farm.  It seems there
was nothing he couldn’t do!  He and his wife were incredibly friendly and
social, both could instantly put anyone at their ease.  You know how some
people can just talk to anyone?  Well Fred is like that.  Animals and children
instantly adore him.   Whatever he turns his hand to, he seems to do with
natural ease.  He was just as happy dressing up as Father Christmas or
supervising a ‘spit-off’ between alpacas.  That’s what you call it when you
put a male and female together to see if the female is pregnant.  If she is,
she will reject the male forcefully – hence ‘spit off’!  We spent hours and
hours together on the farm, working in all weathers and doing extraordinary
things.  Lugging water down to far fields when pipes were frozen; herding
animals together to move them from one field to another, or simply playing
with the goats, dogs or other animals that could be great fun to interact
with.  He patiently taught me practical skills like driving the tractor, and
how to inject the alpacas or trim their feet.  We laughed all the time.  I
think from the outside we were probably unexpected friends, but we got on
brilliantly from the start and even today can talk each other into the ground
when we do meet up now and again for a coffee and catch up in town.

Fred is retired now, but still as busy as ever, he helps manage a pre-nursery
school doing their books and administration, but also going in to help play
with the kids when he can.  He also has a couple of energetic dogs to keep him
up and about every day.  What makes him so interesting I think is his breadth
of life experience.  He has seen and done so many things, yet he is unassuming
and generous.  In all the years I’ve known him he’s never had a bad word to
say about anyone – despite been given cause to do so.  He is generous with his
time, always sees the best in other people and adoring of his wife.  They have
been together for a very long time indeed, but still always hold hands
together when I see them together walking down the street.  He isn’t just an
interesting character, he is an inspirational one too.  He has quietly
ploughed his own path as the saying goes, and he is a loyal and wise friend
too.  In an age when many people feel compelled to constantly remind you how
impressive and interesting they are through Facebook, celebrity or even what
they wear – he is a breath of fresh air.  He genuinely has compelling stories
to tell and interesting insights to share, but only with those who bother to
take the time to stop and ask.  Every street, every bus stop, every café
probably has someone like him.  It is always worth a cautious smile and a shy
‘hello’ in a new place, you might encounter someone more interesting than you
could possibly imagine if you just keep an open mind and take the time to ask
questions and listen as well as talk!

**Sample Answer 2:**  
Mr. Albert Jonathon is our physics teacher and he is perhaps a very
interesting person I know about. As a person he is a very talented and honest
person. He is also a very good teacher, and a veteran of science. However, he
is a living contradiction who believes in many superstitions even after being
a man of science. I mostly like him because of his creative and effective
teaching style and I find him interesting because of his personality and
interesting activities.

I first met Mr. Albert when he came to our class as a physics teacher. I was
in my second semester then. He is basically a lecturer in our university and
this is his main profession. Apart from that he writes for a science magazine
and also works there as a part-time consultant.

There are many aspects I find very interesting about him. First, the way he
dresses is quite primitive and outdated. Someone mistakenly will think him as
a clerk or as a jobless person instead of being a professor in a large
university. Interestingly his preference for wrist-watches and shoes are quite
exceptional and all of his watches and shoes are branded and must be very
expensive. Again, as a physics teacher when he tells ghost stories, you won’t
believe him. He is a gifted person with a quite remarkable ways of teaching
and inspiring others. I personally like his teaching style very much. Then his
fascination about stamp and coins is also interesting. He has some hobbies
which are popular among children and could hardly be seen among adults.
Finally, he has a rich collection of books but he never lends any books to
anyone. As an explanation he once told us that people hardly return his books.

Everything I know about this person is quite interesting to me. Thus he is
probably the most interesting person I have ever known.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 457 - Describe a good photo someone took for you

for-you&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a good photo someone took for you.

**You should say:**

  * when and where the photo was taken
  * who took the photo
  * what the photo depicts

**and explain why you like this photo.**

**Sample Answer 1: **  
Generally, I hate having my photo taken! I like the idea in theory, but the
reality is often very brutal and disappointing. I think perhaps I’m just not
very photogenic, and being faced with the truth of how I look with my rapidly
expanding waist-line and less than glamorous appearance is not always a
pleasant experience. However, just occasionally, very occasionally, someone
will come up with a photo of me that is genuinely ‘good’. It might not be
quite accurate to say I ‘like’ such a photo, but I can appreciate it! I’m
going to tell you all about one of my favourite photos that someone took of
me. I’ll explain when and where the photo was taken, who took it, what the
photo depicts and why it is I like it so much – even though it isn’t a
flattering image at all.  
  
So, the photo was taken just a couple of months ago. It was taken at an event
called the Bamford Sheepdog Trials. If you aren’t from a county where sheep
are kept, this might not mean anything to you. I’ll try and explain. In the
UK, dogs, usually a particular breed called a collie dog, are often used by
shepherds to help them herd sheep. They are very well trained to turn in a
particular direction, or lie down still, stalk quietly ahead or run on as fast
as they can, depending on the particular whistle or verbal command the
shepherd gives. Working with a dog in this way is very skilled. In the summer
months in rural areas it’s not uncommon for local agricultural shows to take
place where shepherds and their dogs compete to show off their skills. The
shepherd commands his dog to herd a small flock of sheep around a course of
obstacles in a big field. They have to pass through gates, separate out one
particular sheep and so on. These events often take part in glorious
countryside, and it is usually the case that as part of the occasion, as well
as the sheepdog trials that are the centrepiece of such events, there will be
country stalls, sheep-shearing contests and cake-baking competitions. In
addition, there will sometimes be a fell race of some sort. It might be up to
six miles cross country – often just straight up the nearest hill and back. It
is an opportunity for locals to test their fitness against each other in a
good humoured race across county. So it was, that I came to be taking part in
the fell race linked to Bamford sheepdog trials, and that is where the photo
was taken. Bamford is a little village in the Derbyshire Peak District,
England, close to the city of Sheffield where I currently live. I’d heard
about the event and thought it would be fun to go out to the countryside and
watch the shepherds working with their dogs and sheep to show off their
skills. There was indeed also a ‘little fell race’ taking place. At just £5 to
enter and only 5 miles long it sounded manageable – I run a bit, though
admittedly I hadn’t really done a fell race as such before. Still, Bamford is
a beautiful part of the world and I figured it would be a lovely way to see
some of the area by romping up Win Hill (the highest point nearby) and
admiring the view before scampering back to the showground at the end.  
  
The photo was taken by someone I know, who is not a professional photographer,
although he is a very, very good amateur one. He often turns out at local
running events and specialises in ‘action shots’ of runners in various fell
and trail races taking place in the area. His wife was also taking part in the
fell run, so he’d come out to support her, and was going to take the
opportunity to bring along one of his many super-sophisticated cameras to
capture the occasion. There’d be plenty of subject matter to choose from,
animals, people, and beautiful scenery – as well as all the runners flying up
and down that big hill of course.  
  
As to the photo he took of me… Well, the short answer is that he snapped a
portrait of me at the very moment I crossed the finish line of the fell race.
In the photo, both my feet are off the ground, I’m punching the air with one
hand, and my other is gesturing in some wild celebratory wave of
acknowledgement to the crowd as I seem to be rejoicing at completing the race.
My head is thrown back in laughter, and you can see my hair (which is longish)
swinging around with the movement. It is a fantastic photo. If you saw it in
isolation, you would ‘know’ I must be in first place, I am ‘obviously’ joyful
because I know I have finished victorious, nothing but first prize could
possibly explain my body language! It isn’t a flattering photo because
honestly, nobody looks that good when running, and my head angle makes it look
as if I have a double chin! (I hope I haven’t really). However, you can’t not
smile at the photo as it is a great action shot that seems to capture an
apparent moment of triumph. The shot is perfectly in focus as well as
perfectly timed. It forever records a second of euphoria, communicating all
the excitement of the race. You can see my race number on my club vest; the
hills in the background, the tape of the finish line in the foreground,
spectators applauding me home on either side of the finish funnel. I think
there might even be sheep in the far distance, being carefully herded by the
sheepdogs as part of the competition. This picture is more than a running
portrait of me, it tells the whole story of the event itself. It would make
you wish you were there to be part of the occasion I promise you…  
  
So, why do I like this photo? Well, because it makes me laugh. As I said, you
would think from the picture that I had ‘obviously’ come first. In fact, I
found the fell race ridiculously hard! The route seemed to just go vertically
up a mountain, which was more like climbing than running.  Coming down was
even worse, far too steep for me to be brave enough to do much more than pick
my way down gingerly and slowly – I wasn’t going to be running any of that!
Within a few hundred metres of the start all the other runners had disappeared
out of sight. I was way, way behind everyone else, and held onto that place
for the next hour and a quarter! For the whole run, I couldn’t even see the
other competitors ahead as they had sped away so fast. I’d imagined this would
be a ‘fun’ event with lots of ‘have a go’ runners who, like me, just turned up
on the day to romp round as best they could. Instead, it seems it is a highly
competitive annual event, people had trained all year to take on this mountain
challenge. I was woefully ill-prepared. So it is, that this picture, far from
showing me returning victorious in first place, is a picture of me coming in
last.  Not just last, but last by some minutes.  
  
The reason there are spectators cheering me in, is that the organisers all had
to wait to make sure everyone had come back safely from the mountain. I had
been out there for so long on my own people had started to gather to look out
for me wondering where I was. The crowd wasn’t so much waiting to congratulate
me, but about to set off on a search party before it got dark! As for my
joyful expression. It is true, I am euphoric, but it isn’t the face of someone
shouting in victory, it is me grinning furiously in pure unadulterated relief.
I hadn’t died out there, but against the odds, made it home safely! I love the
photo, because I find it hilarious. If I framed it and had it on my wall and
said nothing, visitors to my home would ‘assume’ I must have been the best
runner on the day. It would be my choice as to whether or not I corrected
them, and explained I was actually the worst… and by a very long day. It isn’t
a flattering photo, but objectively it is a good one, so much action, so much
emotion and such a sense of occasion. I like it best when I don’t think about
the picture as being of me as such, but a memory, and a story captured in
perpetuity!  
  
And they say ‘the camera never lies’? I know otherwise.  
  
[**Lucy Marris** (2016):  Careers Adviser (UK), TEFL teacher (Vietnam)]

**Sample Answer 2:**  
Well, if I have to pick a really good photo that someone took for me I would
select a black and white photo that my grandfather took for me when I was only
5 years old.

As I recall, this photo was taken by my grandfather with a camera he newly
bought. It was my first day at school and my mother made me ready for the
school early in the morning and I was all dressed up. I went to my
grandfather’s room to ask for his blessing and he gave me a new fountain pen
and a story book. He then took me to the garden and took this photo. It would
be probably 1990 and it must have been the winter season.

He told me to stand still and then smile while he would take the photo. This
was a very new experience for me. After I saw this picture I noticed that I
was smiling in the photo and a part of the garden was visible in it. This is
still a very important possession for me. My grandfather is no longer with us
and this photo reminds me of his memory and my childhood. This picture
represent my early childhood and the very thought of my sweet memory of my
grandfather and childhood is something I cherish. For this reason this is one
of the most beautiful photos for me.

**If you prepare for this cue card you should be able to answer the following cue cards as well:**

  * Describe a photo you really like.
  * Describe one of your favourite photographs.
  * Talk about a photo you have in your room.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an importation occasion or event (such as a wedding or a
celebration) you have attended.

**You should say:**

  * when and where you attended this occasion.
  * who else attended
  * what you did

**and explain how much you enjoyed it.**

**Sample Answer 1:**  
Isn’t it interesting, that thinking of an important occasion or event, the
examples given for this cue card are ‘a wedding or celebration’ yet, when I
thought of the most recent ‘important occasion’ I have attended, it wasn’t
really either of these….  I’ll try and explain.  I’ll talk about when and
where I attended this event, who else was there and what mu role was.  I don’t
know if ‘enjoy’ is quite the right word to use to describe how I felt about
going, but I will tell you why I was pleased to be present for it and why it
was so important I was.

So the occasion was just last month.  I had to go to the funeral of an elderly
relative of mine, who early in the New Year had died at the age of ninety.
The funeral was held about a five hour drive away from where I live, so it was
a long way to go to be there to say goodbye, but it was very important to me
to be there.  I was very close to her.  We were relatives, but only very
distant ones.  I’d got to know her as an adult, and we had exchanged letters
with each other on a regular basis for over 25 years – that’s a quarter of a
century.   Our letters covered a multitude of topics from politics to travel
and work.  She herself had lived a full and interesting life, traveling all
over the world and publishing many eminent papers on a range of topics from
scientific enquiry to classical art - but in her last few years was in great
pain.  The last time I saw her was to join her for a celebratory lunch for her
ninetieth birthday.  She was mentally strong, but physically frail, and it was
clear she was treating this occasion as a farewell meal.  It wasn’t a surprise
to me that she died a few weeks later.  Of course I wanted to be at her
funeral, it was really important to be there to ‘send her off’ with affection,
and share memories of her life with others who knew her and cared for her too.

This relative had never married, and didn’t have children. Even so, there were
many people there.  She would have been really pleased to see friends and
neighbours as well as family members join the goodbyes.  She did have some
nieces and nephews, as well as me, a cousin, who were all at her last birthday
meal.  Together we came up with memories of her to include in the Eulogy about
her life that was read at the ceremony.   I suggested a range of readings that
I thought were appropriate to her interests in the natural world and
enthusiasm for literature.  The funeral itself was poignant of course, but it
was also a joyful celebration and recognition of a full and unique life.  She
had lived life to the full as the saying goes, and frankly was ready to go at
the end.  Her passing will leave a huge gap in the world, but although it may
sound strange the funeral was joyful too.  My role was to contribute ideas for
the Eulogy, but also to start the service with a reading.  I chose one from
The Tempest, one of Shakespeare’s plays.  It is quite a famous extract, and is
probably used at funerals a lot as it is quite appropriate.  It starts ‘our
revels now are ended’ and I think she would have appreciated it as she loved
Shakespeare very much.

I don’t think I’d use the word ‘enjoy’ as such for a funeral, as it doesn’t
seem entirely fitting.  However, I found the ceremony and the gathering for
tea and sandwiches that followed it incredibly comforting.  It was lovely to
hear stories of this relative that I’d not heard before from other people, and
share happy memories.  Someone had even found some old black and white film of
her playing on a beach with her father and siblings when she was just a
toddler.  The footage was hilarious!  She and her two brothers are running
unevenly along in the sand, their father is playing with them with real joy.
But it was a different time, so even though it is a hot day at the seaside, he
is wearing a three piece suit with a tie, a hat and smoking a pipe!  It was
impossible not to laugh at the picture, and be pleased she had enjoyed that
carefree day so many decades ago that we were seeing for the first time all
these years later.  I think she would have loved it!  It brought this cousin
back to life as we recalled with affection the adventures she’d had, the
legacy she’d leave and the influence she’d had on all of us.  Her life did
make a difference, and that is all any of us might wish for.  I believe as
long as you talk about people and remember them they are still with you in a
way.

Although perhaps you weren’t expecting me to choose to talk about a funeral as
a celebratory event, I still think it is appropriate.  This funeral was indeed
a celebration of the most remarkable life, and I was certainly an important
occasion.  I think it is only apt that both she and her funeral should be
remembered with affection and with a smile.

**Sample Answer 2:**  
Well, it was a birthday celebration of one of my cousins and I consider it as
an important and memorable event as I met so many of my relatives in a single
day and I had a really great time with them. This was a rare event for me and
I enjoyed a lot.

It was three or four years ago and the birthday party was arranged in a large
party hall in our hometown. My uncle and aunt decided to celebrate their son-
John’s birthday, as they were scheduled to leave the country in few months to
permanently live in Australia. This was John’s 12th birthday and his parents
invited more than 300 guests. The guest-list included mostly our relatives,
John’s friends, my uncle’s colleagues, and some neighbours.

This was a special event and happy celebration for me basically because of two
reasons. I said goodbye and wished luck to John and my uncle and I had a
chance to meet so many of my relatives in a single evening. This was quite
exciting to see all my close relatives and their children. Just after I
reached the party hall I noticed that some of my cousins were gossiping
together. It was a long since I had seen many of them. They were also happy to
see me and they called other cousins and we enjoyed our time together. We talk
about each other, took photos together, exchanged our phone numbers and
enjoyed our dinner. On this very occasion I met some of my relatives after
quite a long and meeting them in person was a very stirring experience for me.

I also bought a gift for John, the birthday boy, and congratulated him. I also
invited my uncle to visit us with his family before they leave the country. My
younger sister Sara and my parents were very happy and excited about the whole
event and I could tell they enjoyed the event very much. I must say this was a
very rare occasion and the excitement and delight it brought for me was
boundless.

-traffic-jam&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a time when you had to wait in a traffic jam.

**You should say:**

  * when and where it happened
  * how long you were in the traffic jam
  * what you did while waiting

**and explain how you felt when you were in that traffic jam.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Well, traffic jam in our city is not unusual and the regular commuters often
suffer from horrible congestion on roads. A recent study shows that around 20
hours of time is wasted for an average commuter each month in our city and
that statistics depicts how heinous the traffic jam in our city is. While
thinking about a time when I had to wait in a traffic jam, I could remember
many such events and for this cue card topic I will talk about a particular
event when the traffic jam was so pathetic that I literally went mad!

It was about a year ago when I went to our national air port to see off a
relative who would leave for the United Kingdom. On our way to the airport the
traffic was usual and we reached there in a taxi that took around 45 minutes.
After I saw off this relative, I went to the nearby bus station to pick a
public bus to return home. I got a bus within 15 minutes and in next 10
minutes the road traffic was good. All of a sudden the bus stopped at a
traffic signal and it did not move for the next 20 minutes. People on the bus
got anxious and they started talking about what happened. I got off from the
bus to investigate what actually happened. I tried to talk to a traffic police
but he was so busy that I could not even grab his attention. I got back to the
bus and heard more bad news. Some passengers were talking about an accident
and how that had created the deadlock on the rout.

I bought a newspaper and waited next 30 minutes very patiently and was
expecting that things would get back to its normal condition soon. However, it
did not and I heard that many students have blocked the road as one of their
classmates died because of the accident. Police and those students had a hot
debate and they were adamant to leave the road until the bus driver who caused
the accident was arrested and punished. It was a situation that would not be
resolved soon and that’s why many bus passengers left the bus to get back to
their home. I had to reach home and I heard that the alternative road was also
blocked. I was quite furious at that time but had nothing to do. My cell phone
battery was beeping to indicate that it will be turned off any time and the
distance was more than 2 miles to reach home. I decided to walk and then again
waited for few more minutes. Thus two hours passed and at that time I left the
bus to walk.

The walking experience was not that good. There were people everywhere and I
felt stupid not to leave the bus earlier. I saw so many polices and traffic
people who were trying to handle the situation but I noticed things were
getting even worse. Luckily I had no bag or anything to carry with me. Thus I
walked for another 2 hours and finally I reached home quite exhausted and in
awful condition.

**If you prepare for this cue card you should be able to answer the following cue cards as well:**

  * Describe a traffic jam that wasted your time.
  * Describe a bad traffic you have experienced recently.
  * Describe the traffic jam in your city.
  * Describe a time when you were late for an important appointment.
  * Describe an even when you were stuck in a bad traffic.
  * Talk about a time when you had to walk for a long distance.
  * Describe an accident you have seen.
  * Describe a journey that took a long time than usual.

enjoyed&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a foreign film you enjoyed.

**You should say:**

  * what the film was about
  * who the main actors were
  * where and when you saw it

**and explain why you enjoyed this film. **

**Sample Answer:**  
Well, whenever I think of a foreign film that I enjoyed so much the name ‘Life
Is Beautiful’ pops in my mind. It is an Italian tragicomic comedy-drama film
that was released in 1997. I watched this film in 2002 and this is one of the
best movies I have ever seen.

This film was directed by Roberto Benigni who also starred this film as the
protagonist.  This film was about a Jewish Italian book shop owner who used
his creative imagination to shield his son from the terror of internment in a
Nazi concentration camp during the Second World War.

In the film Roberto Benigni acts as Guido. He is a humorous, talented and
sharp person who comes to the city to start a new life. He has a natural
talent of making the best from each situation he encounters and he falls in
love with a girl. Eventually they get married and have a son. The film depicts
the changing political climate in Italy and then shows that Guido, his wife
and their son were taken to the Nazi concentration camp. As a loving father
Guido hides their true situation from his son and makes him believe that the
camp is a complex gaming competition and they must win. The boy is totally
convinced that the camp is indeed a gaming competition because of his
innocence and his father’s brilliant performance. At the end of the movie the
US force approaches the camp and rescue the captives and the boy was still
convinced that he won the competition. His father is shot by a German solder
and till his death he performs a character to reassure his son that he will be
the winner and would win the prize.

As I said Roberto Benigni was the main character of this film. Among other
actors and actresses Nicoletta Braschi acted as Dora and Giorgio Cantarini was
the boy, Giosuè.  
I saw this films three times. I first enjoyed it with my parents when I was
only 17. Later on I watched in a Cineplex in our city and recently I watched
it in my computer.

This is considered as one of the best film ever produced and the plot of the
story was so astounding that everybody loves it. It depicts the horrors of
wars, love or a father, how we can confront our worse time and how can we be
winner even when we are forced to be looser. The story line, acting,
compelling plot and overall presentation of the movie was so great that I
picked it as one of the best 10 movies I have ever seen in my life.

**If you prepare for this cue card you should be able to answer the following cue cards as well:**

  * Describe a movie you enjoyed a lot.
  * Describe a movie you want to watch again.
  * Talk about a famous movie you know about.
  * Describe a movie you have never watched but would like to watch soon.
  * Describe a movie you have recently watched.
  * Describe your favourite movie.
  * Describe a movie based on a real event or real person.
  * Describe a movie about war or history.
  * Describe a movie you watched in a movie theatre.
  * Describe a critically acclaimed movie you have watched.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 446 - A movie you would like to watch again

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a movie you would like to watch again.

**You should say:**

  * what it was about
  * when and where you watched it
  * who you watched it with

**and explain why you would like to watch it again.**

**Sample Answer:**  
‘Saving Private Ryan’- directed by Steven Spielberg, is the movie I would like
to watch again. As I recall I watched this movie about 12 years ago, when I
was in my high school. This was an outstanding movie with a compelling
storyline, set during the World War II. I enjoyed this movie quite a lot and
this was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I watched this movie in our
DVD player with two of my friends. On a weekend I rented this movie and
invited Patrick and Stephen to watch it at our home.

This movie tells the story of invasion of Normandy in the World War 2. It is
considered as an epic war drama film and it shows notable graphics and
depiction of wars. This is indeed the kind of film that most of the viewers
are bound to like. This film has got many positive criticisms and won many
international awards.

Personally I liked it so much because of its high quality production,
realistic portrayals of war, praiseworthy acting, notable casting and historic
significance. I believe that this movie easily qualifies to be listed in
someone’s all time favourite movies and watching it again would not be less
enjoyable by any means.

Patrick and Stephen are both working full time- Patrick as a lawyer and
Stephen as an investment banker. Few months back we hanged out together and we
agreed that we will enjoy a days off together just for the old time’s sake. We
also agreed that we will spend our time at home just like we used to do in our
high school days. Then I proposed to select a movie to watch and finally we
decided to watch this movie again.

Personally I am a fan of Steven Spielberg movies and ‘Saving Private Ryan’ is
one of his best works. I am sure I will enjoy this movie again with my two
close friends, as much as I did in our young age.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a long journey/short trips you would like to make again.

**You should say:**

  * where you went
  * why you went there
  * what you did during the trip/ journey

**and explain why you would like to make the journey/ trip again.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Two years ago I went to my sister’s father-in-law’s house and it was indeed a
long and exciting journey that I would love to make again. I went there with
my parents and my younger brother to meet my newly married sister and her in-
laws. This was a sub-urban area called Villa Maloti and it was so beautiful
that I initially couldn’t believe it. The serene and mesmerizing nature, lake,
picturesque roads and houses and simple and traditional lifestyle of people
took my heart away. It was like a perfect world in someone’s dream.

This area was more than 700 km away from our living place and we needed to
change our vehicles 3-4 times to actually reach there. Interestingly instead
of making us tired and bored, the journey actually revived us. I can think of
three reasons for that. One – we were very excited to meet our relatives; two
– the side view was unbelievably beautiful and pleasant; three- we had such a
family tour after a long. I actually want to make this journey all over again
only because this was quite a remarkable journey and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

After we left our home, we took a taxi to reach the train station. The train
was about 40 minutes late and during that time I read a newspaper. I also
checked the news on my mobile phone. Our train journey was for 4 hours and
during that time I mostly enjoyed the natural beauty of the passing villages.
We had our breakfast in the train. After we left the train we had to take two
different buses and finally a taxi to reach our destination. During the bus
journey I either talked with my mom or read the story book I took with me.
This was an interesting journey and I enjoyed most of it. I wish to visit that
picturesque and beautiful sub-urban area again and meet my lovely younger
sister who got married. The soothing experience of the train journey and the
chance to stay away from the busy city life are the reasons I would love to
make this journey again. In fact I am very much looking forward to making the
journey once again soon.

for-someone&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an occasion when you waited for someone.

**You should say:**

  * who you waited for
  * when and where you waited for the person
  * how long you waited for the person

**and explain why you waited for the person and how you felt about it.**

**Sample Answer:**  
I must confess that waiting for someone for a long is something I am never
fond of, particularly if this person is supposed to arrive at a time that we
both agreed upon. This topic reminds me a time when I had to wait for my best
buddy, John, at a park nearby my home and he showed up at least two hours late
than he was supposed to.

It was about a year ago when John invited me to visit his hometown during our
semester break. I convinced my parents that I will go to John’s hometown for
only couple of days just to refresh myself and to enjoy the beauty of a
suburban area. However, we fixed a date and in the morning John called me that
he will pick me from the park and I should reach there within 30 minutes. I
left home after 20 minutes and thought John would come anytime to pick me up.
The horrible waiting experience then started and as I remember I had to wait
at least 2 hours till John finally arrived.

I had no idea that John would arrive so late and I could not reach him in his
cell phone though I tried several times. At a time I started worrying that
John must have been in some kind of problems and I thought to return home.
However, something inside me told that John would not abandon the tour without
any valid reason and he must have been in some kind of emergency. The waiting
time somehow seems longer than usual and waiting for two hours seemed like so
long to me. I felt anxious for the first 30 minutes and then started worrying
about John. At a time I started feeling stupid for leaving before John
reached. I even felt angry and thought to cancel the tour. So I would say my
experience was not good while I was waiting for him.

However, when John arrived and explained that he had to run to a hospital
where his uncle got admitted all of a sudden and could not contact me due to
the mobile network, I felt clam and considered the reason a valid one for the
delay.

**If you prepare for this cue card you should be able to answer the following cue cards as well:**

  * Talk about a time when you had to wait for a long.
  * Describe an event that made you anxious.
  * Describe a time when you waited for a friend.

sample%2F2428-when-you-spoke-with-someone-in-a-foreign-
language&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about an instance when you spoke with someone in a foreign language
for the first time.

**Please say:**

  * when it was
  * with whom you spoke
  * what language you used

**and say how you felt about it.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Oh my, I have a feeling this is going to be a slightly embarrassing anecdote,
but we all have to start somewhere experimenting with using another language
‘for real’ for the first time! Even though I blush at the memory, on balance
it was also a lesson in how most people are a lot more forgiving than you
might think, as long as you ‘show willing’ and at least make an effort to
communicate in a friendly and sincere way!

So, I’ll tell you when it was, who I was speaking with (though it might be
overstating things a bit to say it was a conversation), what the language was
and how I felt about the interaction.

So, the situation was that I went to Vietnam to work as an English Teacher.
I’m ashamed to say that even though I was going to help students improve their
use of English as a foreign language, I myself am really terrible at learning
and speaking other languages. I hope that this fact might make me more
sympathetic to my students. I really do understand how hard it is to learn an
unfamiliar vocabulary that sounds strange and even feels peculiar as you try
to form the words in your mouth and move your tongue in odd contortions to
create new sounds. This adventure was over a year ago now, but I remember it
all very clearly. Anyway, I went to Vietnam speaking absolutely none of the
language at all. I did have a guide book, and tried to learn some ‘useful
phrases’ in advance using that. However, I found out very quickly that
learning Vietnamese was considerably more challenging than I’d anticipated –
and that’s saying something, as I was quite fearful of the challenge before I
went. The problem for me, is that Vietnamese is a tonal language, and as my
first language is English (which isn’t)  I just didn’t have an ear sensitive
enough to pick up the difference between how what seemed to me to be
essentially the same word, might be uttered in 6 different ways to convey 6
distinctly different meanings. It was all very alien. However, where I was
working very few people spoke any English, and I felt it was very rude of me
not to make an effort to communicate in Vietnamese, however poorly.  My
arrival coincided with Vietnamese New Year, and I did learn to shout out with
enthusiasm a poorly pronounced version of ‘chúc mừng năm mới’ as I interacted
with local people around that time. I fear my expression was rather ugly and
inexact, but the context helped – it was pretty obvious what I was trying to
say, and this, coupled with the festive atmosphere meant if I uttered it then
usually I got a friendly wave and response in kind.

Where I was living, there weren’t any real cooking facilities, so I had to go
out to eat all the time at local places. I am vegetarian, which was more
uncommon than I expected in this part of Vietnam, so I set myself the task of
learning to order a basic vegetarian noodle dish and an accompanying mango
smoothie (because they were completely delicious and you can’t get anything
like that in my county); along with a white iced coffee. I wanted to do so
with courtesy and say ‘hello’ and ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ to the staff at
whatever eatery I ended up in. A kind colleague where I was working helped me
by telling me what the phrases were, and how to pronounce them correctly. I’m
not sure I could to be honest, but I wrote the words down carefully in a way
that I hoped would mean I’d be able to read them out later. If I took my time,
I thought I might be able to approximate the correct pronunciation and so I
could be understood. So it was, one day I took myself off to a new restaurant,
and carefully used my prepared speech to order a meal. The Vietnamese waitress
was absolutely lovely. I could tell she was struggling a bit to understand
what I was saying, but after a few attempts she laughed in recognition. She
was really delighted that I ‘could speak Vietnamese’. Of course I couldn’t
really, but she told me (in very good English) that most overseas visitors
didn’t make any effort at all to use her language, so terrible as my attempt
was (my words not hers) she was happy to help and rewarded my efforts with a
huge smile of appreciation. She was too polite to really correct my
pronunciation, but in a way it didn’t matter. We still managed to communicate,
and I think it helped build up some rapport. I got the meal I wanted
(including my delicious mango smoothie and iced coffee afterwards) and I felt
like I’d made a significant breakthrough. I stuck out a bit in the community
to be honest, as I was the only foreigner working in the area. This meant that
all the local restaurants and street food stalls learned quite quickly what I
liked to eat and order and probably brought it anyway without me having to
really ask correctly. However, that isn’t the point. I do think it’s important
to try and communicate in the native language of your host country. It also
helped remind me how self-conscious my own students might feel in uttering
unfamiliar English words publically, in front of me, a native speaker-
although there was really no need, I would only ever applaud their efforts in
trying. Trying to learn just a tiny bit of Vietnamese was quite humbling for
me. I was just so bad at it!. In the many weeks I was there, I don’t think I
ever really progressed all that much, but I do have increased respect for
anyone who can acquire even the most basic competence in another language let
alone become fluent in communicating.

So how did I feel? Well, a bit self-conscious because I wasn’t very good, but
I also felt pleased with myself for at least having tried. I And, I suppose in
literal terms I succeeded too, as I did get the meal I wanted!  hope my
efforts made me a better teacher, and perhaps a better guest in Vietnam too.

The ability to speak another language is an extraordinary gift and talent. For
some lucky few, language acquisition comes easily, the rest of us have to put
in a lot of hours and blood, sweat and tears to get to that point. However,
the reward in being able to connect with other people and cultures from all
over the world is priceless. I don’t think I’ll ever be fluent in Vietnamese,
but I hope that whatever countries I may be lucky enough to visit in future I
will always be brave enough to learn to say (and use) simple but important
phrases like  ‘please’ and ‘thank you’… Having said that, though, it’s worth
remembering that personally if in doubt I’ve always found nothing communicates
more effectively than a wide smile, open body-language and a willingness to
laugh at yourself. Some things it seems are indeed the same the world over, a
winning smile is surely one such thing!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a funny text message you have ever received.

**Please say:**

  * what it was about
  * who sent it to you
  * when you received it

**and explain why you think this was a funny text message.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Though some people might disagree, I find the concept of sending and receiving
text messages quite fascinating. I often send text messages to others and love
receiving witty and humorous text messages from my friends.

I got a very funny text messages from Rocky and it was one of the funniest
text messages I’ve ever received.  This funny text message was about another
friend who had a funny way of taking and dealing with others.

Rocky was my best buddy during my university days and we still are quite good
friends. We often try to meet each other even in our busy office schedules. He
often sends me text messages and most of his messages have some kind of humour
or a unique way of expressing something. The particular message I am talking
about was sent by him and we were in our 7th terms in our university. As far
as I recall I laughed for a few minutes after I read his SMS. This was funny
yet thought provoking while it charcterised another funny friends of ours.

It described how the friend is question uses his money to earn respect and
companionship from others. However his trick does not work with us and this is
something he has complained about to Rocky that days. On the evening Rocky
sent me a text messages which was more like a poem and it was quite a good
one. I quite liked the rhyme and underlying meaning of the message and that’s
why I still remember it quite well.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a day when you thought the weather was perfect.

**Please say:**

  * where you were on this day
  * what the weather was like on this day
  * what you did during the day

**and explain why you thought the weather was perfect on this day.**

**Sample Answer:**  
I

###  Part 3: Discussion topics:

**Types of weather:**  
**Q. What types of weather do people in your country dislike most? Why is that?**  
**Answer:** In England it rains all the time and it's really cold here on such days. I think that most people hate when it's raining and windy at the same time, because apart from the fact that they can't see anything and want to move forward, the pressure of the wind makes them go backward. Something else that really gets me on my nerves is that my clothes get wet and I can't use my umbrella because of the wind.    
  
_**Tip: **_You can also say that you don't like the hot weather or even the
snow. Just think of the weather in your country and mention which is the worst
one for you.

**Q. What jobs can be affected by different weather conditions? Why?**  
**Answer:** It seems to me that different weather conditions can affect different occupations. Builders and farmers are negatively affected if it rains heavily.  For example, if the weather is rainy people who works outside  cannot work properly. Pilots and ice-cream sellers are two other vocations that are affected by bad weather as well. In the first case, rain, snow and wind have a great impact on schedules while for the ice cream sellers, volume of sales and whole business depends on season and weather. 

**Q. Are there any important festivals in your country that celebrate a season or type of weather?**  
**Answer:** I cannot recall such festivals or celebrations in my country. However, I am certain in many countries this is quite a common trend to celebrate different weathers and seasons. For instance, the first day of the year, Rainy season, Autumn and Spring are often celebrated in India and Bangladesh. If we look back in our history, our ancestors mostly celebrated different festivals which were based on different seasons and weathers.         
  
**_Tip:_** Think of different kinds of festivals in your own country and mention few of them and how they are celebrated.    
  
If there is no such festivals in your country, simply state that this types of
festivals are not celebrated in your country. Just remember, if the answer is
negative, don't be upset that you said very few words. As mentioned, not all
of your answers can be extended.

  
**Weather forecasts:**  
**Q. How important do you think it is for everyone to check what the next day’s weather will be? Why?**  
**Answer:** It's very necessary to know the weather forecast because people should know the type of clothes they should put on. For example, if it's going to rain, they'll wear boots, jacket and of course take an umbrella with them. In addition, it's important for the means of transport they are going to use, for instance, if they will to go to work by car, bus or on foot. Finally, if they have any kind of plans they should be informed about the weather conditions because their plans can be ruined by bad weather. So I would say people's activity, dress and type of vehicles they will take depends on weather condition and that is why they should always check the next day's weather. From my experience I can say that people do not do that, often suffer and regret a lot. 

**Q. What is the best way to get accurate information about the weather?**  
**Answer:** I would say that watching weather forecast on TV or the internet are the best ways to be informed about the weather conditions. But, we should be very careful because the internet can provide inaccurate information so we must be sure that the site we have access  is reliable. Apart from that cross checking different TV channels and websites is another good idea to get more accurate weather forecasting. 

**Q. How easy or difficult is it to predict the weather in your country? Why is that? **

**Answer:** It's really difficult to predict accurate weather condition in my country because the weather in England fluctuates a lot. For example, few days ago when I woke up at 9 am, the sun was shining and ten minutes later it started raining heavily. Two hours later the wind was blowing and for the rest of the day the weather was like that. The only thing that is standard is the low temperature in the winter. The weather forecast thus often quite tough and unpredictable in England.    
  
_**Tip:**_ Talk about the weather condition and percentages of accurate
weather forecast in your country. In some countries this is really
predictable, for example in Greece the winter is cold and the summer is really
hot. In some other countries it's totally unpredictable. Just analyze it as
much as you can and speak accordingly.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 466 - Describe an actor or actress that you admire

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an actor or actress that you admire.

**Please say:**

  * who he/she is
  * what he/she looks like
  * what kind of movies he/she appears in

**why you admire this actor/actress.**

**Sample Answer:**  
There are plenty of amazing and inspirational performing artists out there to
choose from. However, for this topic, I’m going to go with my first instinct,
because the first actor I can think of, must be at the forefront of my mind
for a reason. If nothing else, this suggests that their work is memorable and
impressive. This actress certainly is.  
  
I’m going to tell you who she is, what she looks like (‘though that is tricky,
as she has had a career spanning decades); what sort of films and other work
she has performed in and why it is I admire her so much.  
  
So, the actress – or actor (in England, some women ‘actresses’ prefer to be
called ‘actors’ as the word should encompass both genders really) is known
affectionately as Maggie Smith. Her formal name and title is Dame Margaret
Natalie Smith, but she is so recognisable in the UK (and probably world-wide
too now) that she is regarded as something of a British Institution, and
everyone here in the UK would instinctively refer to her as Maggie Smith I
think.  
  
In terms of her appearance, because her career has spanned some 60 years, she
has obviously changed a bit over time. However, I think that in some ways her
career and recognisability have grown as she has got older, and probably she
is still in her prime even now at the age of 81 (she was born in December
1934). She is very tall, upright and slender. She has an extraordinary
presence and poise. Her face is very expressive - I doubt she has ever tried
Botox, so she has kept her facial mobility which I’m sure must help her convey
a wide range of thoughts and emotions! Her mouth is quite a straight line, and
she seems to have had a run of playing fairly serious characters (serious to
themselves at any rate, they are often in fact comic star turns for the
audiences). Her eyes and eyebrows are particularly good at communicating in a
tiny movement what the character is thinking. I wouldn’t call her face
wrinkled as such, but it is sort of ‘lived in’ if you know what I mean? She
has a few crows’ lines or laughter lines if you prefer, around her mouth and
eyes. In one word I’d say she was striking in appearance. She has an
extraordinarily compelling air to her, the sort of person everyone would turn
to look at as she entered a room, even without her being famous, but at the
same time she projects an air of calm confidence rather than arrogance. She
tends to wear her hair in a short bob-like style. I think she has allowed her
hair to go naturally grey with age, but in fact in most of her work she wears
a wig for the character anyway, so that is not her defining feature!  
  
As for her work, well, I hardly know where to begin! She is probably most
famous for the films she has been in. For example, she played Professor
Minerva McGonagall in the Harry Potter film series. Other notable film
appearances include ‘The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel’ and ‘Ladies in Lavender’,
and the earlier acclaimed film ‘The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie’. However, she
is probably one of Britain’s most recognised actresses for the many excellent
quality TV period dramas she has appeared in. ‘Downton Abbey’ is one you may
have heard of, she played a stern, Dowager Countess. Despite her impressive
film and television career, for which she has won an extraordinary number of
awards (BAFTA, Academy and Golden Globes just for starters), she began her
career on stage. She has had a glittering career in the UK and America,
appearing on the London West End Stages, Broadway and playing Shakespearean
roles too numerous to mention. She was part of the newly established Royal
National Theatre in London in the 1960’s.  
  
Why I admire her? Well, the breadth of her career in terms of range of parts
she has played is simply astonishing. She has done seemingly everything!
Serious Shakespearean roles, comedy character parts; monologues film, theatre
and television. She will do whatever a part requires, there is no vanity in
her. She recently appeared in a film ‘The Lady in The Van’, which required her
to play a belligerent and elderly homeless woman – a far from glamorous part!
Her professional longevity in a business where many actors struggle to get
work is testament to her remarkable talent. She has a gift for giving what
seem to be entirely effortless performances. Whatever I have seen her in, she
is totally convincing, I never think ‘wow, what a brilliant actress’ when I’m
watching her, I just absolute accept the character she is portraying! If I
knew what her secret was, I’d be doing it myself, but I wonder if it is
perhaps partly, because whether the part she is playing is ‘comedic’ or
‘straight’ she seems to play it with conviction. She can give performances
that are absolutely hilarious to watch, with a dry wit, but the character she
portrays seems entirely unknowing of how funny they are being. She seems
always to respect the writing and the role. She has worked really hard to be
as successful as she is, and she deserved the recognition that came when she
was awarded the honour of being made a British Dame. She is often spoken of as
a ‘National Treasure’ and a ‘National Institution’ because her appearances are
so ubiquitous in film and television (particularly period dramas), and so
widely known and loved. In fact I don’t know very much about her politics or
personal life, but in a way I don’t need to. I’d even go so far as to say I
don’t want to. She is supremely good at her chosen occupation and that’s
enough for me. She is well regarded by her peers, I’ve never heard any other
actor say anything about her which wasn’t positive, full of admiration for
both her work-ethic and her talent. I think for her to be working right into
her eighties is also truly remarkable. I hope she is able to continue working
for many more years yet – assuming that is what she would like to do. After
all, at her age, if she feels she’d finally like to put her feet up and take a
rest, I think she has more than earned the right to do so!

others&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an occasion when you borrowed something from others.

**You should say:**

  * what you borrowed
  * when you borrowed it
  * whom you borrowed it from

**and explain why you borrowed the thing.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Well, I can think of many occasions when I had to borrow important things from
others and for this cue card topic I will talk about such an occasion when I
borrowed a pen from an unknown person when I was in a bank.

I had to borrow a pen to correct the amount I wrote in a cheque leaf and to
add a new signature below it. This was an ordinary gel pen that I bowed from a
person who was also in the bank to withdraw money. I can’t recall his name but
he was standing just behind me in the cashier counter.

It was probably 6 or 7 months ago when I went to my bank to withdraw some
money. I wrote the cheque and signed it from home and went to the bank to
withdraw the amount. I waited about 20 minutes in the queue and when I handed
over the cheque to the cashier, she informed me that my current balance does
not cover the amount I have written on the cheque and my savings account does
not permit over limit. She requested me to rewrite and figure so that she can
give me the allowed amount. After she returned the cheque leave which I was
supposed to correct, I found that I totally forgot to bring a pen. I asked the
cashier if she had a spare pen and she told me that she had lent a pen to a
customer and could not find it. I was quite embarrassed and had to ask to the
person who was standing behind me for a pen. He smiled and borrowed me a pen
that I used to correct the cheque. After I finished with the correction, I
thanked that person and showed my gratitude for lending me the pen. I asked
his name and it was probably Richard or Ricardo, which I am not quite sure
now.

Borrowing something in desperate moments is something we cannot avoid and I
think there are several occasions when I had to do it. The particular even I
talked about is a moment I needed the pen and had no other way than to borrow
it from someone.

####  If you prepare for this cue card you should be able to answer the
following cue cards as well:

  * Talk about an event when someone helped you.
  * Describe a time when you borrowed something from an unknown person.
  * Describe an occasion when you forgot about something important.
  * An occasion when you borrowed something from a friend or a relative.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe someone you know who is famous.

**Please say:**

  * who this person is
  * how you know him/her
  * how long have you known him/her

**and explain how he/she is famous.**

**Sample Answer:**  
My uncle, Oliver, is a professor in our local college and he is quite popular
in our town. Not that he is a national celebrity, but he is very famous in our
area and I am proud of being his nephew. Instead of talking about a nationally
famous person, I would prefer to talk about my uncle.

He is my favourite uncle and I like him for his amiable behaviours and talent.
He is a kind-hearted and benevolent man who is around 45 years old now. Since
he is my father’s only brother and was very close to us, I know him my whole
life. Personally I am quite attached to this uncle and we often play chess
together or enjoy movies in a theatre.

As far as I recall, he has always been famous in our town. He is known to his
student as a talented meth professor, to his colleagues he is an excellent
person, to us he is a great mentor and to others he is a helpful and kind
person. However, his fame extended beyond our city area for his achievement of
a national award as the best math book writer. His book is used in grade seven
as a national text book and this single achievement has made him famous among
many literary and educated societies in the country.  He was once been in the
headline of many national daily newspapers which I still remember very
clearly.

As far as I know, he is kind of introvert and not after fame or popularity. He
has very little interest in money or personal achievements. I had many long
discussions with him and I have come in to the decision that he leads an
exemplary life and he is quite a happy person. Like many other famous people
he has no desire for personal achievements and his good deeds and talent have
earned him respects and popularity. When people find out that I am his nephew
they treat me differently and this single aspect clearly demonstrates how
popular and respected he really is.

###  Part 3: Two-way Discussion:

Q. Do you want to become famous?

Q. What kind of people can become famous in your country?

Q. What are the advantages and disadvantages of being famous?

Q. What do you think of the privacy of a well-known person?

Q. Would you be influenced by the well-known persons in TV commercials?

Q. What do you think of the relationship between a well-know person and

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a historical building in your country or city that you know.

**You should say:**

  * what and where is it?
  * when was it built? Why?
  * what is it known for?

**and describe this historic building.**

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer:**  
I live in England in the United Kingdom where we have a wealth of historic
buildings. For this topic I could take my pick from castles, to manor houses
and even prehistoric stone circles! I am spoilt for choice in thinking about
what historic structure to talk about. However, instead of telling you about
one of our more obvious and famous places, I want to tell you about a little
piece of living history that is near to where I currently live in Sheffield.  
  
I shall tell you what and where it is; and fill in as many details as I can
about when it was built; why; what it is known for and describe it as best I
can.  
  
I first came across this construction when I was exploring a woodland trail
near to where I had just moved to in Sheffield after I had to relocate to this
city for work. Hidden in amongst the trees, and next to a carefully
constructed waterway where the narrow river seemed to have been diverted, was
a humble looking stone-built workshop of some sort. When I first discovered
it, the building was very run-down, almost completely derelict. Although it
was clearly part of the area’s industrial heritage, I had no idea what it was
originally built for. It was overgrown with trees, brambles and ivy, and the
wooden shutters on the windows were falling off and rotting away. Someone must
have told me it was known locally as ‘The Shepherd Wheel’ but that made little
sense. It didn’t seem to be in an area where sheep would be kept, and it
seemed more likely it was for some sort of semi-industrial purpose, but what?
So the building is ‘The Shepherd Wheel’ and it is in the woodland of the
Porter Valley, in the south-west outskirts of the city of Sheffield. As to
when it was built and why, it took me a while to find this out!  
  
Over the course of the next couple of years, some money was made available by
some sort of heritage trust, and a project commenced to return the building to
its former glory. As part of the restoration project, some care was taken to
put up signs explaining the history of the site, and eventually I learned much
more about it, and have been in to see the renovations, and even participated
in some of the work to do so. Only last year I spent a morning volunteering on
the project helping to paint the newly crafted wooden shutters on the windows,
to protect them from the elements of driving rain.  
  
So I can now tell you that this construction is connected to the knife-
grinding industry for which Sheffield was once renowned. Even today Sheffield
has a proud heritage of Sheffield Steel, and many of the buildings in the city
are linked to the Steel industry and the work of ‘the cutlers’ who for some
400 years created fine knives, blades and other steel products. The building
is in fact a surviving example of a cottage industry that was once widespread
on the valley. Set in the picturesque valley of the Porter Brook, this
Shepherd Wheel is a unique, now once-again working example of Sheffield knife
grinding industry. At one time there were many such small water-powered
grinding workshops along Sheffield's rivers abut now this alone remains. I am
told it is the earliest complete example of this industry with evidence dating
it back to the 1500s. That is an extraordinary notion. That site has been
worked for generations, a water wheel turning there since 1584 – or even
earlier. It was mentioned in a will of that date when the wheel owner passed
it to his sons, who knows how much further back in time something was first
constructed on this site?  
  
From the outside, it is a single storey stone building, with windows at the
side.  Inside is an open workshop that seems dark, despite the extent of the
windows. However, at the side of the building, and this is what has now been
restored to working order, is an enormous water wheel. Powered by the force of
water diverted from the river to power the wheel, it turns, and through a
clever mechanism provides the energy to power grit stones on which knives were
sharpened as they rotated within the workshop itself.  Amazingly, the
restoration project has managed to find photographs of people who worked in
the Shepherd Wheel building toward the end of its time as a thriving industry,
together with various tools and equipment that are now all on display. Pride
of place is given to the two grinding hulls, grinding wheels and, of course,
the waterwheel itself. It is a small working museum, staffed largely by
volunteers. It is only open for a few days throughout the year, but well worth
the visit.  On special days they will get the wheel turning, and give
educational tours. You can begin to imagine how in this workshop, in dark,
damp conditions, skilled grinders produced fine, sharp cutting edges. It was
not until the 1930s that grinding ceased and the Wheel's pivotal role in
Sheffield's cutlery industry ended, so this is relatively recent history, just
about within living memory even though the site itself goes back for hundreds
of years.  
  
I love this building, it is in a beautiful location, and has a solidity to it
that pleases me. It is a link to our local industrial heritage. For those that
worked there the work was really hard. Back breaking, and very dusty
conditions with the blade on the grindstones generating lots of dust. I
suppose that’s where the phrase ‘keeping your nose to the grindstone’ comes
from, bent double over a the wheel, knife grinders had to lean right into the
gritstone to sharpen blades, sometimes even lying flat on their fronts, with
their faces near the grindstone in order to hold the blades against the stone.
Lovely as the building is, and important as the heritage is, it is perhaps
unwise to romanticise the reality of what it would be like to work there. All
the same, I’m so happy that people have made the effort to restore the works,
it is important to remember how working life was for local people in times
past.

sample%2F2452-a-letter-you-have-written-to-someone&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a letter you have written to someone.

**You should say:**

  * what the letter was about
  * who you wrote it to
  * why you wrote it

**and explain how you felt about writing this letter.**

**Sample Answer:**  
With the invention and popularity of email and text messaging, letter writing
has already lost its popularity. Nowadays people either text or call someone
to convey a message rather than writing a letter and posting it. The letter I
will talk about is the one I wrote to my younger sister Emma. It was about 4
years ago and I wrote it as a reply to a letter she wrote me. I would like to
mention that I have written many other letters to friends and family members
after I wrote this letter to Emma. However the letter that I wrote to Emma was
different than other letters.

It was a personal letter that mostly expressed my love for my family, how much
I was missing them and how I was doing in my new school. Just after I moved to
a new city and started my class, I received a beautiful letter from my younger
sister who was only 12 years old at that time. In her letter she wrote how
much she missed me and how things were different for her without me being near
her. She also mentioned how my friends were doing and how sad my parents were
during the first few days of my departure. She wrote that my mother was
particularly sad without having me around. She also asked me to write back as
soon as possible with every details of my new life and academic progress as my
parents instructed her.

I wrote a reply letter to Emma and let her know how much I loved her and how
deeply I was missing all of them. I also wrote about my new school, teachers,
classmates, and about the hostel I was staying in. I tried to give her a vivid
description of everything so that she could visualize the details I wrote
about. It was a large letter and took me around couple of days to finish. I
did not give details of my struggle and sad moments as that would have worried
them a lot. I mentioned about my study, food and health condition to assure
them that I was fine.

Moving to a new city and adjusting there is a difficult experience. Personal
touch with family is quite essential during this time and the letter I wrote
and the one I received from Emma and my parents helped me to reduce my stress
and depression level. Writing a letter to someone we care about is always
important and this particular letter was even more important for me to write
as my sister and other family members must have been eagerly waiting to
received it. I felt quite happy after I wrote and posted the letter.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an open-air or street market which you enjoyed visiting.

**You should say:**

  * where the market was
  * what the market sells
  * how big the market was

**and explain why you enjoyed visiting this market.**

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer:**  
I was a bit stumped when I saw the topic on this cue card!  It’s been ages and
ages since I’ve been to a ‘proper’ open air street market.  Where I live in
England the weather isn’t that great, so the fashion for completely open air
markets has passed.  We do have specialist monthly farmer’s markets that pop
from time to time, but they tend to be just selling quite expensive luxury
items. Speciality home cured meats and home-made cheeses, all very delicious
but too pricey for me to shop there. I could talk about one of those, but it
would feel fake, because I don’t really enjoy going to those, rather I just
feel frustrated because I can’t afford to buy anything on sale there! Instead
I am going to tell you about my memories of a more authentic open air market
from my childhood.

I’ll tell you where the market was, what it sold, how big it was and why I
enjoyed going there so much when I was little.

So the market was about a mile away from my childhood home, and was held in a
place called Kingston upon Thames.  I didn’t know it then, but in fact
Kingston is a really ancient market town. It was of particular prominence as a
trading centre because of its geographic location at a river crossing point as
well as the boundary of some ancient territories. Depending on who you
believe, it has a history that goes back for more than a thousand years, which
is impressive in anyone’s calculations surely! So about 45 years ago, I would
go to Kingston market with my mum to do our weekly shop there. We’d usually
walk, or sometimes cycle, locking our bikes up carefully at the end of a
bridge before crossing over the river on it to get to the market. It was a
thriving, noisy and busy place. There were seemingly countless market stalls
which sold predominantly food items. Lots of different fruit, vegetable and
flower stalls competed to attract the attention of passers’ by to buy their
goods. Because we went every week we were wise to any bad practice, and knew
which stall holders could be trusted to supply quality goods and not over-
charge us. I learned from an early age you should always watch the stall
holder select produce from the display at the front of the stall – if they did
it out of sight from the back you might end up with bruised or over-ripe
produce. I also learned to haggle – which doesn’t happen so much anymore
nowadays, but was acceptable even commonplace then. Also, I knew to always
check the contents of the brown paper bags that were handed over to make sure
the quality of fruit and veg was acceptable before paying for it in full! As
well as the fruit and veg, there’d be other items. Household goods, ‘cheap and
cheerful’ clothes and even impromptu ‘auctions’ of bargain scents or potions.
It was a busy, heaving stimulating place. The gutters would be full of
discarded fruit and veg, and sometimes I’d go and pick up these cast offs at
the end of the day as they were good food for our pet guinea pigs at home!

The market extended throughout the whole of the town centre, with different
stalls selling the same types of things grouped close together. All the fruit
was in a part of the town known as ‘The Apple Market’ for example. The area of
streets it used to occupy is still called that now, but the open air stalls
with the colourful striped canvas tops have long since gone, replaced with
gentrified boutique shops selling rather more upmarket goods. Other areas had
clothes stalls grouped together, you could pick up pairs of socks and pants
for practically nothing. They weren’t good quality, but good enough for the
price. Nowadays the market in Kingston does still take place, but is very much
reduced in size, it is more likely to sell ‘posh’ food like expensive artisan
breads; imported luxury olives and exclusive handbags. In my youth it was a
functional place to shop. You could pick up good value, fresh produce in
season, and trudge home laden with bags of potatoes, plastic coat-hangers and
other commonplace items.

Because the produce on sale was always what was currently in season, what was
available varied week by week. Ripe strawberries in the summer were a
particular treat!  However, one outing was a great tradition for us all as a
family at Christmas. Once a year about a fortnight before Christmas Day, me,
my brother and my sister would go with my Dad to choose a Christmas tree from
one of the many stalls selling them in time for the festivities. We would
carefully select one that was just the right height and amount of bushiness,
and then all four of us would hold on to a bit of the tree to carry it the
mile home together in a little crocodile line together. We probably looked
quite sweet and festive all wrapped up in our bobble hats with thick scarves
and gloves!

So I enjoyed visiting the market because it was such an assault on the senses.
The crowds, smells and sights had great atmosphere. The piles of fresh fruit
and vegetable looked amazing, and there were many colourful characters calling
out to sell their wares. You could also pick up some extraordinary bargains at
the end of the day if you were smart, and could risk waiting to make a last-
minute purchase. Stall holders needed to shift items before they went off,
and/or didn’t really want to pack them all up again at the end of the day,
sometimes it was easier for a market trader to just to sell things ‘for a
song’. Occasionally I’d get a huge bunch of flowers for some trifling sum and
feel a real sense of achievement carrying them home knowing I’d got myself a
bargain!

Open-air markets are very different now, well it is in Kingston-upon-Thames at
least. I’m glad I have my memories of the original one, though perhaps I
romanticise it a bit. I daresay stall holders wouldn’t get away with cheating
their customers by choosing stock from the back anymore, and the choice of
products from all over the world is tempting, those have to be changes for the
better. Even so, I still think we have maybe lost something with the
sanitising of the open air market. It is undoubtedly better for health and
hygiene, but I used to love darting round the back of the stalls to scoop up
discarded cabbage leaves and manky carrots to take home to my pets! I suppose
the progress is good, but it’s fun to remember past times too! I enjoyed those
visits, and stored up some memories of what a ‘proper’ open air market should
be like, with a character and surprise around every corner. I like to think
there are still places in the world still were such anarchic and crowded
markets still take place week in week out and canny traders and shoppers sport
with one another to secure the best deals!

people&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a person who has done a lot of work to help people.

**You should say:**

  * who this person is/was
  * where this person lives/lived
  * what he/she has done/ did to help people

**and explain how you know about this person.**

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer:**  
This is an interesting topic. Many people help others as part of their
professional role – perhaps giving advice, teaching students or providing
medical treatment. Of course, all of these things are incredibly important,
impressive and of course helpful. They demonstrate dedication, training,
perhaps even the pursuit of a vocation. Even so, on one level it could be said
such individuals are doing what they are paid to do. Others help people simply
by being open and friendly – like the neighbour who offers a newcomer to the
street a welcome and a cup of tea to help them settle, or a work colleague who
volunteers to show a newcomer the ropes when they start in a new job. Again
this is really commendable, but, thankfully, relatively common place. I hope
of all of us at some time have both encountered, and indeed been, one of those
people offering help. The person I’m thinking of to talk to you about today is
a bit more out of the ordinary.  I’d go so far as to say he is quite
exceptional in terms of what he has done to help others.

I’ll tell you a bit about who this person is, where they live and what it is
they do. I’ll also talk about how I came to know about this person as I tell
the story.

So the person is known locally as The Mohican Runner, he lives in my home city
of Sheffield. To be quite honest, when I first spotted him it was simply
because he has a very distinctive look. He is quite lean and athletic and a
talented runner, so a fast and furious participant in many local races.
However, what makes him stand out is that he has a well sculptured Mohican
haircut. It’s a punk style where the sides of his head are shaved, and then he
has a distinctive central strip of long hair down the middle. This is
carefully combed vertically upwards and much gel and hair spray must be
applied to keep it in place as he runs. Sometimes the Mohican hair is quite
colourful –it used to be green, now it tends to be dyed jet black. In
addition, he sports a lot of tattoos. His arms are heavily inked with various
geometric designs, other shapes are marked on his shaved head and legs. If you
just saw him, it is possible that you might feel quite intimidated by him at
first glance, but once you know his story you will realise you shouldn’t be.
Rather you should approach him and congratulate him and shake him by the hand.

Because The Mohican Runner runs and lives locally, I saw him around a lot. He,
like me, is a regular attendee at my local Saturday morning 5 km parkrun.
(Though unlike me he always finishes near the front!) About a year ago, I
found out that he was setting himself some running challenges to raise money
for some children’s charities. This caught my attention. Not content with
seeking sponsorship for doing a single event, The Mohican Runner set himself
the challenge of running a half-marathon every month for 13 months, the
following year it was to run a race every weekend for a year. The challenges
are in themselves impressive, but also not the point. It turns out that what
drove this fundraising addiction was his own personal experience. He was
himself the victim of really horrific physical child abuse when he was growing
up. He was isolated, bullied and vulnerable. He was only able to escape his
situation when certain charities got involved and intervened and he was then
removed from his family. His story was so extreme it was used as the basis of
a UK wide funding appeal for a national charity. In later life he was safe
from the immediate abuse, but he was still psychologically damaged, he
struggled with his weight and was isolated by his experiences in many ways.
However, he managed to turn his life around. When he began running he was
really unfit weighing some 20 stone, but he lost four stone within a year of
starting to run. His extensive tattoos are to cover up the scars left on his
body by horrific physical abuse. The fund raising is a personal obsession to
ensure that other children might also find a way out of such extreme
situations. When he runs, he really gives of himself.

His fund raising achievements are extraordinary, his story and efforts have
raised somewhere around £1.3 million, which is an amazing sum of money.
However, I believe it isn’t just that he has helped people through fund
raising. I believe by being courageous enough to tell his story he reminds
everyone of how important it is to be alert to the often hidden problem of
child abuse. I think what he does is helpful beyond measure, because even
without the fundraising, he is giving a voice to a section of society that is
often completely powerless and without a voice to represent them at all. There
are few things more powerful than hearing someone talk from personal
experience. I think it must take extraordinary courage to tell and retell a
painful story that I’m sure you would much prefer to be able to forget.

What’s more, I think he is an important role model. Of course it hasn’t been
easy for him, and I wouldn’t presume to say that he has emerged from his
appalling ordeal unscathed, but nevertheless he has come out the other side.
He is a force of nature in all he achieves, and is surely correctly called a
survivor. He has turned his life around (losing weight, raising money,
reinventing family life for himself) against seemingly impossible odds. That
image is helpful and inspirational too. I understand he now is on the brink of
becoming a semi-professional sportsperson, I really hope he does. He also has
a job as a Lego figure designer (no really! I didn’t know such a job existed)
which is surely also a career dream come true, but that’s another story.

Finally, I think his body image – the tattoos and the Mohican hairstyle are a
helpful reminder not to judge people by their appearance and not to jump to
conclusion. What he looks like may not suit everyone’s ideas of ‘proper’
presentation, but when you know why the tattoos are there (to cover scars) and
why the Mohican hairstyle (to make him visible when running for charity) you
will come to realise there is quite another story waiting to be heard.

So to conclude, I think the Mohican Runner has done an enormous amount to help
people, in particular children who are victims of physical and sexual abuse
who perhaps we would rather pretend weren’t there because their plight is
hidden and it seems so impossible to comprehend and hard to help. He has
helped by raising money; he has helped by making his own story public and he
has helped by being a role model. He should be recognised for what he has done
for others.  If you ever come to Sheffield do look out for him, you’ll spot
him sooner or later I’m sure, he’s hard to miss, and he’s seemingly ‘always’
out and about, clocking up the miles, putting in the training and powering on
for his favoured charities.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a time when you got into trouble.

**Please say:**

  * what it was
  * how you got into it
  * how you handled it

**and explain how you felt about it.**

**Sample Answer 1:**  
Well, getting in to trouble and then surviving from the trouble is a basic
human characteristic. I usually avoid chaos or trouble and that’s why I do not
have to face a lot of them. However, I was in a great trouble when I was 11
years old and this event still gives me nightmare.

It was probably 1999 when I went to visit my grandparents in (_…village
name…_) with my parents. It was a very remote area and we had to travel for
more than 11 hours to reach there. I lived with my parents in (_…town/ city
name…_) but most of my uncles and their families lived in the village. As this
was a joint family, I had so many cousins and I loved to visit this
countryside for that. My parents were busy on a hot summer day during our stay
there and I got the chance the play with my cousins. We played several games
and got quite tired and then all of a sudden one of my cousins proposed that
we should all go to the river and swim. I was bit confused as I did not know
how to swim. However one of my cousins convinced me that I should always stay
near them and should not try to go further in the river by any means.

We did not inform anyone and four of us walked for about 20 minutes to reach
the river bank. It was a summer noon and the river looked very placid to me. I
went down the river and was trying to stay as near to the land as possible.
However my cousins were all swimming and were having fun. I do not know how
but all off a sudden I felt that I was in deep water and two of my cousins
were trying to pull me back. I remember that I was struggling a lot to get
closer to them but the sudden waves were forcing me far deeper. That time I
was quite frightened and was shouting for help. Two of my cousins went to
manage help and luckily two adult people came for the rescue.

I would say these two good natured unknown people saved my life that day. I
was too young and too intimidated to handle the situation myself. I would say
I got lucky that day.

It’s quite tough to explain how I actually felt that day. I was frightened and
was completely taken aback by the surprise trouble. It was surely a near death
experience and even though I am a good swimmer now, I remain very cautious
whenever I get in to water.

**Model Answer 2: **  
Hmmm… depends what you mean by trouble! I can think of an example which was
very troublesome at the time, even now I look back and cringe in embarrassment
as I recall and relive the incident. I shouldn’t really though. With the
distance of time, and looking at it from an outside perspective I probably got
it rather out of proportion at the time.  
  
So, I’m going to try and tell you what the situation was together with how I
got into it. How I handled it (badly), and how I felt about it.  
  
So, I must have been about 13 years old at the time. This can be a bit of an
awkward and self-conscious age, which is why I found the situation so
difficult. What happened was, I had to catch a train to somewhere. I can’t
even remember where I was going. I went down to my local railway station, and
bought a ticket from the station manager at the ticket office. I then made my
way down a long tunnel towards the platform. I found I had a few minutes to
spare, so I decided to take a little detour to go to the loo so I would be
more comfortable for my journey. There was a ladies public conveniences down
another dark passageway, which was at right angles to the main tunnel. I
wandered down, and as I went into the lavatory block, I noticed the main
entrance door clanged shut behind me. I didn’t think much of it at the time. I
just nipped into one of the cubicles, and then after I’d finished and washed
my hands I went to leave. I approached the big, solid, metal door, and found
to my horror it was locked shut. It didn’t even have a door handle. It was a
really heavy-duty secure door, almost like you’d expect to see in a bank
vault. For some inexplicable reason, once it slammed closed behind me, it
couldn’t be opened again other than with a key, and only from the other side!
I was locked in, that door wasn’t going to open again for me ever. Uh oh!  
  
To begin with, I was a bit irritated, but not really worried. I thought
someone else was bound to walk by at some point, and they’d spot the door was
locked and ask for it to be opened. It was a bit inconvenient, but it was
hardly the end of the world. This didn’t happen. Quite a few minutes passed.
Then a few more. I started to feel a bit anxious. The station master was too
far away to see or hear me, and because the lavatory block was at the end of a
side passage, it began to dawn on me that really, very few people would bother
to go down it. I looked around. I was essentially in a dark, locked room.
There was a single window with bars across it, but it was really high up.
What’s more, because of the way the station was designed, this window actually
overlooked a street that was the opposite side to the station entrance. From
the street, even assuming I could attract someone’s attention, it wouldn’t be
at all obvious where my voice was coming from, or how on earth to get to the
space I was trapped in. It wasn’t even a very well used walk way, I had no way
of telling if any people were using it – the window was far too high up for me
to see out of it. Pretty soon, I heard the rumble of the train I was supposed
to have caught as it pulled into the station, stopped and then pulled away
again. Fifteen minutes later, I heard the next train come and go. It was time
to act if I was going to get out by nightfall!  
  
Cautiously, I scrambled up onto one of the toilets, and hanging on to piping,
managed to get as close as I could to the barred window. It must have been
left open, so I had some chance of making enough noise to get some attention.
To begin with, I was a bit shy about shouting out. I tried a few tentative
‘hellos’ and ‘excuse me’, no reaction, nothing. It would have been a quiet
street anyway, and I had no way of knowing if there were any passers-by at all
there in any case, let alone whether they could hear me, as I couldn’t see a
thing! Eventually, my fear of being shut in there all day and maybe all night
too got the better of me. I just screamed ‘help, help!’ After what seem like
an age, I finally heard an almighty clunk as a big old-fashioned key turned in
the lock of the door behind me. The station master who’d sold me a ticket
about an hour ago had come to my rescue. I climbed down from the toilet, I was
relieved to be let out, but I was also mortified. I could have sworn he was
smirking a bit, laughing at my plight – though now I look back it probably was
a bit comical, and it was hardly his fault I’d got into this predicament!  I
mumbled thanks rather sheepishly, without making eye contact, and raced past
him to catch the next train and to get away from there as fast as I could. I
never did find out who it was who heard my cries, worked out I was in the
station and went to alert the station manager to my plight.

So how did I feel about it? Well, at the time I found the situation
excruciating. I was so embarrassed that the station manager had had to come
and rescue me that I avoided using the railway station for months afterwards,
even though it was the one nearest to where I lived. I preferred to walk an
extra couple of miles to the next stop and so avoid having to see him again.
Even when I did start to use my local railway station again I never, ever used
the public conveniences, just in case…  
  
So, whilst I’d be the first to concede that getting locked in a public
lavatory isn’t the worst of troubles to befall someone, it certainly felt like
a big deal at the time. I was literally red-faced, as my cheeks were burning
with embarrassment at the time when I was rescued. For ages afterwards
whenever I thought about it I blushed again. If this same situation happened
to me now I’d probably just laugh it off… After all, it was hardly life
threatening, and I’m not the first or last person to get locked in a toilet
block I’m sure! I suppose also in truth I’d probably also have a mobile phone
with me nowadays (this story happened pre the advent of mobile phones) so it
would be rather easier to summon help more quickly too! Even so, whenever I’m
using a public loo in an unfamiliar area these days, I always have a little
look at the doors and locks before I commit to entering alone… you can’t be
too careful as I’ve learned from bitter personal experience!

with-a-friend&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Talk about a strong disagreement that you had with a friend.

**You should say:**

  * what it was about
  * who you had it with
  * how you resolved it

**and explain what happened after the disagreement. **

**Sample Answer:**  
I usually go well with all of my friends and I have a tendency to listen first
and then react. However, this is always not the case and I can recall some
events when I had to strongly disagree with my close friends. I will talk
about such an event when I had a strong disagreement with Paula, who is one of
my very best friends, how it happened, how we solved this dispute and then the
result of this disagreement.

I was in my early university days when this disagreement took place. Our
course teacher gave us an assignment and it was about writing a review on a
foreign movie. That was the part of our mid-semester assignment and the
teacher could absolutely pick any topic as an assignment for the students. I
was places in a team of 4 members and Paula was also in this team. She was one
of the top performing students in our class and well-known for her enviable
results.

We had only 4 days to submit our assignment and after the class we agreed that
we will watch this movie at Richard’s place (another team member for the
assignment). Strangely Paula did not show up in the evening and her cell phone
was turned off. We were worried about her and rescheduled to watch the movie
in a later date. Next day I met Paula at the university campus and asked her
if everything was okay. She looked surprised and said ‘oh, yes’, everything is
absolutely fine.’ She also asked how was the movie and that shocked me. I then
realized she did not come last evening intentionally. I told her that we had
rescheduled the movie watching and this time she must appear at Richard’s
place.  She laughed mockingly and told me to cancel it and write the review
from the movie review websites. She also suggested me she is going to write
the review for us and we could focus on something else.  That’s something I
could not agree with and had to strongly disagree with her.

I tried to convince her that the whole concept of the assignment was not to
copy-paste contents from any website and that’s something I am not going to
accept anyway. We had a hot debate for about 20 minutes and at the end of our
loud conversation, we both became annoyed with each other. I finally told him
that I will not be with her for this assignment and would report the teacher
to assign me to a different team.

Umm, after two days two other team members interfered and they proposed a
solution that both of us (Paula and I) will write our own assignment and
review and they two will decide which one is better and that one would be
submitted as the team assignment.

However strong the disagreement was, our friendship was stronger and Paula
yield to follow my lead to finish this assignment. That’s how the dispute and
disagreement was resolved and we were all happy about that. Honesty speaking
the disagreement was so strong and at a time I thought that’s going to harm
our friendship. But in reality

Paula was a smart and understanding woman and she accepted my proposal to
resolve this issue. After we got A+ for our assignment, we were all happy and
contented.

**If you prepare for this cue card you should be able to answer the following cue cards as well:**

1\. Talk about a time when you had a disagreement with someone.  
2\. Describe a situation when you had to disagree with a friend.

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 478 - Something new or exciting you did

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something you did that was new or exciting.

**You should say:**

  * what you did
  * where and when you did this
  * who you shared the activity with

**and explain why this activity was new or exciting for you.**

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer:**  
I know what to tell you about here!  I’m going to tell you all about what I
did, where and when it was, who I shared the activity with and why it was both
new and exciting for me.

I love trying new things.  I’m not particularly brave, but I hate missing out
on adventures, and I am curious about the world.  On balance, even if
something is uncomfortable, or positively frightening, I’d much prefer to
‘give it a go’ and face the consequences, than walk away from the opportunity
and wonder what might have been.

Last year I went on holiday to a fitness boot camp.  It was in Northumberland,
right by the sea. This is a wild and beautiful location in the north of
England.  The week involved lots of different activities, abseiling; hill
walking; river kayaking; climbing (I was rubbish at that); body boarding;
orienteering even learning how to build wild shelters out of scraps of wood.
Lots of those activities were new and/or exciting, but there was one thing in
particular we did that gave me a massive adrenalin high!  Coasteering!  Now
I’d never even heard of this before, so I think you might also need me to
explain a bit more about what exactly it is!

Essentially coasteering is a cross between orienteering and coastal (ocean)
swimming.  The activity involves exploring a rocky coastline from the sea,  by
climbing, jumping, and swimming along its edge.  It is quite strenuous, and
you have to be brave as you are moving along the coast in an inter-tidal area
with ocean currents, tides and hidden rocks to contend with.  It isn’t just
clambering over rock pools, nor is it swimming as such it is something in
between.  With the cold rough waters of the North Sea it is an activity it
would be far too dangerous to do on your own.  You need to be with a group and
a leader who knows the area and what is safe and what is not.

So the activity was coasteering, the location was Northumberland, and the
timing was August 2015 I think.  In terms of who I shared this with, well, I
went out with a group of about 6 other fellow holiday-makers and our very
experienced, patient and lovely guide Bruce.  We all wore full wet suits and
old trainers to protect our feet as well as life jackets (buoyancy aids) and
helmets.  Even so I was very apprehensive as we walked over the slippery
seaweed covered rocks towards the crashing waves.  The first challenge was
just climbing into the water as the waves seemed huge and the water was
freezing.  However, once you have literally taken the plunge, the shock of
adrenalin and the effect of the wet suit soon warms you up!  Our leader was
very safety conscious thankfully, so although I was a bit scared (I’m not all
that strong a swimmer) in fact he carefully checked each route before we
followed, using a rope to link us all together where necessary.  As the time
passed we got ever more confident, at times the waves washed us off rocks like
we were droplets being shaken of the coat of a wet dog, but after a bit you
start to realise that even though you feel like you are being tossed around in
a giant washing machine it is actually pretty safe.  The buoyancy aid makes it
impossible to sink, and as long as you don’t fight the currents, but go with
them, it is really fun.  You do have to surrender control to some extent which
feels weird and unsettling but once you do, oh my what a ride!  It was
incredibly exciting.  You are seeing the landscape (coastline in this case)
from a really new perspective, in amongst the waves, gazing up at huge rocky
cliffs, jumping in and out of rock pools, and screaming with laughter as you
are swept along.  Without the necessary equipment and guidance it would be
terrifying, you’d end up drowning, or injuring yourself by being battered
against the rocks but this way it was enormous fun.

So coasteering was new and exciting because it was something I’d never even
heard of before, let alone experienced.  I had no idea at all what to expect.
It was exciting because it moves you out of your comfort zone.  Your heart is
racing and it is a physical as well as mental challenge to keep on going.
However, it was also incredibly enjoyable and rewarding.  Because we were a
small group we all encouraged one another and pulled together, it was a great
way to make new friends.  I’m not sure it would suit everyone as a team
building activity in the work place but I guarantee it would be effective!

Although it was hilarious, it was challenging.  I’m really, really glad I did
it, once.   However,  I don’t know if I’m quite brave enough to do it again!
That said, I’ve already admitted I do have a terrible fear of missing out, so
I think I probably would!  You should too, if you ever get the chance, but
please make sure you trust your guide first, and don’t even think about it
without proper equipment, it would be all too  easy to get swept away, the
oceans are a powerful force, and not to be trifled with!  It is being in
amongst all that power of nature that made the experience so awesome and
memorable!

##  IELTS Cue Card Sample 463 - A place where you want to have a home

have-a-home&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a beautiful place where you want to have a home.

**You should say:**

  * where this place is
  * how you know about this place
  * what type of home you want there

**and explain why you would choose to live there.**

**Sample Answer:**  
This is a nice topic to talk about. I have long been dreaming to have a home
of my own where I will have absolute freedom to live and the place would be a
nice one, close to nature, the home would be according to my choice and
everything would be picked by me.

Well this dream house would be near the hill which is around 2 kilometers away
from my current living place. This hill is one of the most beautiful places in
our hometown and I would pick this place to build my dream home. There are
numerous hills and tea gardens in this locality and I would specifically
choose a tall hill where I would be able to build a small home with pine
woods. The flat top of the hills would allow me to build a home and a large
portion of this place would be used for gardening and farming.

I know this place from my childhood. This is a naturally beautiful place where
I went for the first time with my family for a picnic. I was around 12 years
old at that time. We had our lunch in the hill top area where 3-4 farmer
families used to live. The idea of having a home there was formed in my mind
at that time. I have visited this place several times later on and the
serenity and beauty of hills, river, tea gardens and simple lifestyles of the
inhabitants appealed me a lot each time.

I would build a wooden home that would have 4 rooms. One for my bed room, one
for guests, third one would be my study room and the largest one would be the
one where I will work. This would be a simple hut type home with large front
garden and farming lands. I will pick the wooden furniture and obviously
everything I will need to live a decent and hassle free life.

There are many reasons I would love to live there. First, the beauty of
nature: the surrounding view, the flowing narrow river, tea gardens, green
picturesque scenery and sound of nature would be the perfect elements to live
in peacefully. I think this would allow me to stay away from a chaotic urban
lifestyle and to stay near the nature. Secondly, this would allow me to finish
a book I have started writing which is still in its initial stage. I would
have plenty of time to appreciate the life and meaning of being alive. The
urban life surrounds us with so many problems and complexities that I
sometimes feel severely stressed about. I would take this excellent
opportunity to revive my spirit and self satisfaction.

**If you prepare for this cue card you should be able to answer the following cue cards as well:**

  * Describe a naturally beautiful place you know about.
  * Describe a place you want to live in.
  * Talk about a house you would love to own.
  * Describe your dream house.
  * Describe something you would like to do in the future.
  * Describe a plan you have for a long time.

###  Part 3: Discussion topics:

**Different types of TV programmes:**  
**Q. What are the most popular kinds of TV programmes in your country? Why is this?**  
**Answer: **Although I don't watch TV very often, I think that TV serie stands in the first place among popular TV programmes. There are different types of TV series  such as soap opera, drama, romance, adventure, science fiction, crime and investment, comedy and so on. For example, Sherlock Holmes is very popular TV series not only in England but also in other countries. Regarding the reasons why this is happening, I would say that those TV series are very interesting, entertaining and you can spend your free time watching it.  For instance, when I watched a police procedural television series, I learnt almost everything about crimes and investigations and that turned out to be even educative. These types of TV series has great variety of topics and the plots are very attractive. That is why people do not want to miss any episode of their favourite TV series.    
  
_**Tip: **_Every country has its own popular TV programmes. This is just an
example and it's based on my personal opinion. So don't take for granted that
this is the only correct answer. You can talk about news, talk show,
investigative programmes, debate show, talent hunt show, reality show, sports
programmes etc as the most popular TV programme type in your country.

**Q. Do you think there are too many game shows on TV nowadays? Why?**  
**Answer: **As I said earlier, I am not a TV fan! However whenever I surf TV channels I can obviously feel the number of overwhelming sports channels. This is a proof that people nowadays watch more sports channels and sports telecasting than ever before. Likewise the number of game and quiz shows in different TV channels is also quite high. I have noticed my mom watch two game shows and she likes them very much. People often watch game shows because those programmes are entertaining and educational at the same time. The competitive nature and challenges attract many viewers to watch such programmes.  Sometimes there are questions for the viewers and as a viewer someone often gets the chance to earn prize or the opportunity to participate in the live show. These are in my opinion are the reason games shows are more popular these days and there are so many of them.        
  
Tip: Your answer could be negative as well. Not every country has many game
shows. If so, you should say the reasons you believe this is happening. Also
give one or two personal reason(s) why game shows in your country are not
popular.

**Q. Do you think TV is the main way for people to get the news in your country? What other ways are there? **  
**Answer: **Well, I come from Greece, so I would say yes, TV is the main source to get news in Greece. In my country TV is the main way for most of the people to get information about different news and events.  Only few young people and adults get the news via the internet and the elderly from radio and newspapers too.    
  
In England, where I currently live in, TV is a popular means of getting
information but I wouldn't say that it's the most popular source for news and
information. People of all ages rely on Internet, social media and newspapers
to get news.

  
**TV advertising:**  
**Q. What types of products are advertised most often on TV?**  
**Answer: **Actually, this is a difficult question because I think that most of us don't pay much attention to TV's advertisements. At least as far as I'm concerned, I always change the TV channel when they start showing advertisement. But, I would try to answer this question by saying that different types of edibles are advertised such as juices, soft drinks, cookies, chips, cosmetic products et cetera. Moreover, especially the last five years, technological products are also being promoted on TV advertisement. Some representative examples are smartphones, iPhone and laptops. Finally, cars constitute a category that is advertised a lot and there are many times that famous people like actors, singers and football players, are the main representative of those products. 

**Q. Do you think that people pay attention to adverts on TV? Why do you think that is?**  
**Answer: **As I mentioned earlier, most people do not pay that much attention on TV adverts. There are very few times when someone watches an advertisement because of the attractive theme of that advertisement. When a TV channel broadcasts advertisements, most people either change the channel or do other things. My opinion is that not every person is interested in every short of  advertisement. Another reason people pay less attention on TV adverts is that when watching a movie or a favourite programme, advertisements often bother them. Amid of a lenghy programme people need to take breaks and they mostly do that when advertisements are shown.    
  
_**Tips:**_ Your answer could also be that people pay attention on TV adverts.
If you say sao, just clarify it with some examples. Try to say that those
adverts are informative and present newly arrived products or services. They
also inform us about the benefits of different products and let us chose our
necessary goods among a great variety of options. Also mention that ad
creators use different innovative methods so that people watch it. Finally say
that, people can hardly leave their seats while watching a live sports
telecast or a favourite programme and when advertisements are shows, they
interntionally and subconciously watch them.

**Q. How important are regulations on TV advertising?**  
**Answer:  **I believe regulation on TV advertisements are of paramount importance. First of all, TV advertisements are displayed constantly all the time and the audiences comes from different age groups. For that reason, contents of an advertisement must be suitable for all audiences. In addition, every advertisement must be based on truth, moral code and sole purpose of informing people. Moreover, they should promote public health and not provide anything that might induce people to damage their health, such as tobacco and alcohol ads. Finally, the adverts should never exaggerate or falsify information about a product or service. To monitor the ethics, morality and regulation every advertisement should be censored before it is displayed on TV.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a rule you did not like in school.

**Please say:**

  * what it was
  * how others thought about this rule
  * have you ever violated this rule

**and explain why you did not like this rule.**

**Sample Answer:**  
Well this topic reminds me my school days when things were quite different
than they are now. Things were magical, more colourful and in my mind
everything was possible. I quite loved my school days and our teachers were
very friendly. When some of my neighbours were worried about their kids in
schools, my parents on the contrary were very contented about their son’s
schooling.

I loved everything about my school except one thing – attending the cultural
programmes arranged by the teachers and class captains on last Thursday of the
month. It was mandatory to attend this event every month and I did not like it
at all.

I mostly hated it because I thought that attending in this event should have
been optional, not mandatory. If I loved singing, dancing, debating or acting
only then I would have felt attracted to such events and in my case this was
not true. I loved listening to music but when I had to sing, I simply loathed
it. Same goes for dancing, debating, poem writing, acting in Shakespeare’s
play and so on. In my timid and fragile mind this was kind of torture. Though
I feel differently these days about this rule and event and find it quite
charming, it was not the case in my school days. Another reason I did not like
the rule was because the power the class captains exercised during the event.
To illustrate how they used their power I would like to tell you an event. One
day I had a disagreement with my class captain and he threatened me that he
will have his revenge soon. Two weeks later during the cultural program he
selected me as a volunteer singer in a play without even notifying me. That
was quite an embarrassing moment for me.

I think others mostly enjoyed this event and rule until they were called to
attend the programme in front of the teachers and other students. Some of our
classmates have passions in such events and they enjoyed participating and
they felt that everybody should attend it. A few students were more attracted
to sports and TV shows and they did not like it as far as recall. I actually
violated this rules quite a few times. Once my parents came to meet my math
teacher and I went home with them and skipped this programme. In many other
occasions I tried to skip attending this programme and in some cases I was
successful.

If you ask me whether this was a good rule or not, I would say this was in
fact a good rule to introduce art, literature and cultural programs to the
young students. I learned more about Shakespeare and his work through this
prorgammes than reading academic books. Thus it was a good initiative and a
good rule as I understand now.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a house/ apartment that someone you know lives in.

**Please say:**

  * whose house/apartment this is
  * where the house/apartment is
  * what it looks like inside

**and explain what you like or dislike about this person’s house/apartment. **

**Sample Answer 1: (House in Sheffield, England)**  
Well, at first, I was a bit flummoxed by this topic. I suppose that’s because
it is easy to take for granted the sorts of accommodation people live in, and
not really pause to think about it all that much. I have moved around a lot
for work and so try not to get too attached to houses or flats I’ve rented as
I am never sure how long I might be in them. The location of the accommodation
is usually the most important thing for me when I’m choosing where I live, and
so I don’t really tend to judge other people’s living situations as they too
can be precarious. However, now you have given me the topic to talk about, I
can think of one example of where a friend lives that immediately comes to
mind. I’m going to tell you all about her house, where it is, what it’s like
(as best I can) and the pros and cons of her choice of home.  
  
So, this friend of mine is someone who I’ve known for years. She is married,
and shares her home with her husband and two almost grown up children. They
are quite a sporty household, interested in lots of activities like walking,
cycling, running and music. Both her sons play in student bands. My friend
also runs her own business (mail-order cookies) from the basement of her home,
so it’s quite a busy household!  
  
The house is in Nether Edge, which is an established residential suburb in the
southwest of the City of Sheffield, England. This is in colloquial terms quite
a ‘posh’ area of Sheffield! It is a relatively affluent area with wide tree-
lined streets and lots of little boutique shops, delicatessens and even its
own well-established amateur theatre in the area. It has a real community
feel, everyone there seems to know their neighbours and take an interest in
what is going on on their doorstep. The houses tend to be Victorian, built of
solid stone.  The grandest houses have their own walled gardens and are packed
with ‘original features’ like large windows, beautiful old fire-places,
picture rails and wooden floor boards. Some of the houses have now been sub-
divided into flats, and there are a few newer properties tucked away within
the region. Generally though, it’s a very pretty area of the city, with a mix
of attractive terraced houses and some larger detached properties. It is
certainly a very ‘desirable’ place to live, particularly for people with
families, as it is safe, with a community feel and properties large enough to
accommodate the biggest of families.

The house my friend lives in is a beautiful rambling Victorian home. It has
many original fireplaces with black hearth stones and attractive tiles along
the sides of the open fire grates. There are wooden floors a-plenty, high
ceilings and the house goes up three floors high as well as down into the
basement. She has converted this area into a lovely kitchen for her business
on one side of the basement, the other side has racks of bikes carefully
stored away in the dry. In the walled garden she can keep a few chickens –
which is a relatively rare privilege in what is almost a city location.
Because the house is usually a hive of activity, the kitchen is always a warm
and friendly place where you can sit at the large kitchen table and catch up
on gossip over a cup of coffee. From the hallway, there is a large reception
room where in winter you can snuggle up in front of a roaring open fire on one
of the two squidgy sofas placed in their for guests. The house has great
character, a little bit of faded grandeur perhaps, but it is really
impressive.  
  
What do I like about the property! Well, it’s gorgeous, I love the quirkiness
of the Victorian property, the luxury of a real fire and the original features
are stunning. It is a busy household where there is always something going on
and a warm welcome too, it isn’t just the architecture of the building and the
possessions within it that make it an attractive property, it is the family
within it!  In my dreams, I’d love to live in a property like this, however,
the reality could be a bit different. The tall ceilings and large rooms are
indeed gorgeous, but they aren’t very practical in an English winter. The
property is hard to heat and the electricity bills must be huge. All those
open-fires and so many stairs and rooms make it hard to keep clean. Old houses
don’t tend to have much in the way of storage, so there is a constant battle
to find ‘homes’ for the clutter of living. Still, I reckon that would be a
small price to pay for such a lovely home, one day perhaps... In the meantime,
I feel very lucky that my friend is so willing to welcome me and others to
come and visit her there and enjoy it too. I’ve had some very happy times in
that lovely home, but you know what, if she had to move I’m sure as she is so
hospitable, I’d find I quickly became just as attached to her new home even if
it was a complete contrast and a small, modern flat in a high rise block. It
is people that make a home, not the bricks used to construct the walls that
surround them!

**Sample Answer 2: (House in Queensland, Australia)**

####  **Describe the most beautiful house you have ever seen. **

####  **Describe a beautiful house/ home you have been to. **

Ok, so rather than tell you about a ‘typical’ home I know, I want to share
with you the story of possibly the most amazing house I’ve ever been lucky
enough to visit. I only went there once, and it was a very, very long time
ago, but it made such an impression on me that I feel I can still visualise it
really well. I’m going to try and explain who the property belonged to, where
it was, what it looked like inside (this is the real surprise) and try and
explain what it was that made such a strong impression on me.  
  
So, the story was, I was traveling in Australia. An elderly relative of mine
now living in the UK, had spent many years working there, and was really keen
I look up an old friend of hers who lived ‘in the rainforest’ in a quite
remote part of Queensland, near a coastal village called Cardwell. I was a bit
apprehensive about doing this. The woman it was suggested I meet was in her
eighties and I knew nothing about her other than that she used to work with my
cousin and that she was recently bereaved.  To my shame, I imagined a rather
lonely and aged woman and I wasn’t looking forward to the visit.  
  
I interrupted my coach trip up the East Coast of Australia to get off at this
remote and tiny tropical coastal town in Far North Queensland, Australia. When
I visited in the early 1990s I think the population was only just about one
thousand people. I got off the coach and my heart sank a bit, there seemed
nothing there, and I didn’t even have phone number for this woman.  It wasn’t
a usual tourist drop-off point and I was the only person to disembark – I
think I may even have had to request that the driver made a special stop at
the settlement just for me. I stuck out like a sore thumb. I made my way to
the only accommodation available (a sort of cheap camping/ hostel/ motel
place) and quickly people started to ask me what I was doing there. I
explained hesitantly I was looking for this woman ‘Margaret’, feeling silly
for doing so. How on earth would I find her?  Well, it was amazing. Everyone,
literally everyone, immediately knew who she was, I was warmly welcomed by
association. She was clearly something of a local celebrity, very well-
regarded and described as indeed ‘living in the rain forest’. Within a couple
of hours of my arrival, a forest ranger turned up. It seemed he had somehow
heard I was looking for her, so he’d come in his off-road vehicle to pick me
up and take her to her home! I had no idea what to expect, but clambered into
the truck, and off we went, bouncing down rutted tracks, deeper and deeper
into the rainforest.  
  
After a little while we arrived at her ‘house’. Oh my. I have never seen
anything like it before or since! Imagine a little wooden house, raised up on
stilts, with a veranda completely encircling the structure, a rather crude
slatted wooden roof and wooden interior walls. Imagine all of this, but with
no external walls! It was as if the property had just grown organically from
the forest floor.  The weather was warm year round in this part of the world,
and clearly my host felt very safe in the forest. Rather than have a barrier
between her and the forest, she chose to have no exterior walls, her living
space merged with the plants and animals that surrounded her. I think there
may have been a low wooden fence at the back of the property, but really this
was mainly to stop things falling off her platform, rather than give privacy
or security!  
  
I sat and joined the ranger and my relative’s elderly friend for tea in her
‘living room’ which was open to the forest. It was extraordinary. Birds could
flap through, the noises of the forest were all around us. It was completely
magical. I heard all about my host’s work and career. It turned out she was a
passionate conservationist, who, together with her late husband, had been
instrumental in securing World Heritage Site and Site of Special Scientific
Interest status for the beautiful uninhabited island of Hinchinbrook which
lies off the coast of Cardwell. She was also very active in working to
preserve Cassowaries, a bird I’d never even heard of, but which I came to
learn is a large, flightless bird most closely related to the emu, and
terribly endangered due to loss of its natural habitat. Being in her house was
complete sensory overload. The house was just a shell of interior walls that
essentially served as a viewing platform for the forest but it was where she
lived. No phone, no electricity, but home all the same. The interior walls
separated her bedroom area from the living area where she welcomed guests, but
the whole structure was exposed to the elements on the outside – apart from
the roof which overhung the planks of the porch quite considerably. It blew my
mind that you could make a home in such a way and in such a place. Also, that
although you might think she’d be isolated, clearly the ‘bush telegraph’ meant
even living in the middle of the rainforest as she did, it was just a couple
of hours from me getting off that coach unannounced to a message reaching her
that I was looking her out and she arranging to have me as a guest in her
home!  
  
What did I like! Well, feeling part of the rainforest. It was an unobtrusive
dwelling, probably we would call it ‘eco-friendly’ in the language of today.
She told me that sometimes she’d be having an early breakfast on her porch and
see cassowaries wander past. They are incredibly shy and rare so that is a
remarkable thing. I loved the quirkiness of the house, the minimalism of her
furnishings. You really don’t need very much in the way of material things to
have a good life.  Also, I suppose there’s very little point in having lots of
possessions when the rainforest might encroach on you at any moment. I didn’t
like the mosquitoes though! I was wearing shorts when I visited and I’d swear
I still have the scars from the many bites to my legs from those pesky insects
feasting on me on that day. I don’t mind, I even like them in a way. They are
a physical reminder of a memory that otherwise seems almost too extraordinary
to be true!  
  
I wish I’d made this visit when I was a little older and wiser. I’d have asked
far more questions about what her life was like and how the house came to be
built. However, the important thing is that I had the chance to visit at all,
and to be reminded there are many ways to live our lives and many different
dwellings from which to do so. Not all of us will be lucky enough to create
our little patch of paradise, but it is heartening to think some will. It also
reminded me not to rush to judgement and to listen more carefully to what
people say. I had stereotyped what an ‘old’ person would be like, but in her
eighties here she was living independently in very basic accommodation but
full of passion for new projects and with an energy that put me to shame. I
also wondered in retrospect what it was I expected to find. Everyone I met
told me ‘oh Margaret, you’ll find her in the rainforest’ and that was
literally where she was, yet somehow I hadn’t expected to take that statement
at face value.  It was no short-hand, it was her spiritual and physical home.
I hope she had many more happy years living there and carrying on with her
one-woman campaign to save the Cassowary too. One day I’d like to find my own
quirky dwelling and make it my home. I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone so at
peace with their surroundings.

neighbours&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe something you borrowed from one of your neighbours.

**You should say:**

  * what you borrowed
  * who you borrowed it from
  * why you borrowed it

**and explain how you felt about borrowing it from a neighbour. **

**Sample Answer:**  
Almost two years ago I had to borrow a rice cooker from one of my neighbours.
Her name was Catherine and she was a very good person. She lived next to our
house with her husband Alfred and three beautiful children. She was a full-
time mom and I liked her amiable behaviour and genuine smile.

I do not cook that often but one day when my younger sister and tow of her
friends came to visit us, I planned to prepare the lunch myself. When I was in
the middle of my cooking preparation, I found that pour rice cooker was not
functioning. I had no idea that it was out-of-order. Only then I knocked on
Catherine’s house and requested her to lend me her rice cooker. In fact
Catherine had two rice cookers and that’s why it was not a problem for her to
lend me one. As far I knew Catherine, she would have lent me her rice cooker
even if she had only one of it.

I was really confused when I decided to ask Catherine to lend me her rice
cooker. I really needed it to finish my cooking, especially when my sister and
her friends were waiting for the lunch. This was the first time for me to ask
something from Catherine. You can understand my dilemma about borrowing it. On
the one hand I needed it badly and on the other hand I was quite confused
about lending it from one of my neighbours. I was thinking if Catherine
rejects my request, it would be quite embarrassing for me. However finally I
felt totally relieved when Catherine lent me her rice cooker and I returned it
just after I was finish with my cooking. Catherine seemed quite surprise but I
explained that I did not want to use it more than once. She was laughing and
assured me that I should ask her for anything I need without any hesitation.

The rice cooker that I borrowed from Catherine was manufactured by Philips and
was one of the latest models. I liked it very much and in few days I bought a
similar model for us.

hometown&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe an interesting place in your hometown.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * how you can go there
  * what people do there

**and explain why you think it is an interesting place. **

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer 1:**  
For my job I currently live in the capital city of our country which is ...
_(say the name of the capital city in your country...)_. It has been more than
5 years since I left my hometown and yet this is the town where my heart
belongs to. I will always remember the days and places where I spent my
childhood and teenage, the golden years in my life. The name of my hometown is
_(...say the name of your hometown...)_ and it is located in the northern part
of the _(... say the city/ district name where this town belongs to...)_. This
town will always be special to me, no matter where I go, how far I go. There
are many interesting places, if I consider from different perspectives, in my
hometown that I can recall now. Out of these places, the rail station, which
is located at the southern corner of our city is the one I would like to talk
about.  
  
In my childhood, the rail station in my hometown was the most mysterious and
interesting place for us. We, as children, were not allowed to enter the main
premises where the rail stopped and this prohibition made us more curious
about this place. This is still a place which is quite interesting for me.
This is possibly because this rail station is the entry and exit point for me
to and from my hometown. When the train drops me off to this station, I feel a
sensation of being home. On the contrary, during the time of my departure, I
feel an acute melancholy that I won't be able to express in words. This place
has always been a mystery to me and it is still a place full of happiness,
sadness and enigma.  
  
From two other perspectives, this place is quite interesting to me. One- the
surrounding view of this station is quite spectacular and would give someone
an impression that he is standing above a tall mountain and can see the green
fields below all around him. The view gives the first impression about the
natural beauty this area has. In fact I have never seen any other train
station which is located in such a higher place and gives such a beautiful
view.  Second- the different types of people who come here each day is an
interesting thing to observe. Some people come here to sell numerous products,
some wait for their relatives or family members to arrive, some to see off
their relatives or friends, and finally some are part of the administrative
office of the rail authority. In my opinion this is an interesting hub of
people from different ages, places and purposes.  
  
If I am to suggest a foreign tourist about the interesting places of my
hometown, I would suggest him to start with this rail station. This rail
station will give a very good idea about our town, people and places to be
there. To me this is the gateway to a beautiful town where my heart belongs
to.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a story that was particularly interesting to you.

**You should say:**

  * what it is about
  * who told you this story
  * when you heard this story

**and explain why this was an interesting story to you. **

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer 1:**  
Every story is taken either from human experience or from human imagination
and when a story is told, the audiences and readers try to connect it with
their own experience or creative thinking. Thus each story is a great one and
interesting if this is told to the right audiences in a right tone. An
interesting story that I would like to talk about for this cue card topic is
not taken from someone's imagination; rather it is taken from a real event. I
heard this story from one of my uncles and he told me this story in my
childhood and this is still an inspiring story for me.  
  
This is a story about a man who risked his life to save others from an
imminent disaster or more accurately from death. It was 1995 and a massive
hurricane stroke in the _(...say the name of a suburban/ rural area...)_. As
soon as the hurricane hit, the disaster and destruction were everywhere. Many
people died and many were injured. Yet many others were trapped in and needed
to be rescued and hospitalised immediately. Though there were many rescue
workers who were working ceaselessly, they did not have enough time to save
all the trapped people. At that time a man named Thomas came forward and made
a group of young people in order to arrange a rescue team. Thomas himself was
more than 50 years old, yet he had been able to motivate 10-12 other young men
of this area to help the trapped people within a very short time.  
  
They worked really hard for more than 24 hours and as I heard from my uncle,
more than 30 people were rescued due to the brave initiative of Thomas. My
uncle was one of the team members of this rescue team and every time he
mentioned Thomas, I could feel a great respect in his voice. It was a great
tragedy that Thomas lost his wife and only son in a devastating earthquake a
few years later and left the area to settle in a different city. People of
this area will always remember his bravery and great courage, at least for
next few decades.  
  
I have read and heard many other interesting stories but Thomas and his team
did something extraordinary and I will always remember how good people among
us work selflessly to help others.

sample%2F2497-place-you-visited-that-has-been-affected-by-
pollution&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a place you visited that has been affected by pollution.

**You should say:**

  * where it is
  * why and when you went there
  * how it has been affected by pollution

**and explain what are the reasons for this pollution. **

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer:**  
Thank you for letting me talk about this topic. Last year I went to visit
(...say an area name in your city/country...) with two of my friends and
thought we would enjoy our trip. We heard from a teacher that this was a
beautiful place to visit and after that, we planned to go there. To our
surprise, this place was severely affected by the pollution and instead of
enjoying our trip, we cut it short and returned home immediately.  
  
It was early summer last year and visiting a place near a river which is
surrounded by natural beauty and recommended by one of our favourite teachers
was an excellent idea, at least at that time. I am sure the teacher who
suggested this place had no idea about the severity of the pollution there and
how things have become worse.  
  
The water pollution was quite severe there and the black and greasy elements
that were floating on the water created a shocking scene. Uncontrolled waste
management, toxic elements from factories and industries, motorised vehicles
running on the water and the lack of proper maintenance of the riverside are
the main reasons the water has got polluted. More shockingly, the air
pollution was also noticeable. I saw many industries and factories that were
exhausting black fumes and that has made the air polluted more than any other
part I know about.  
  
Uncontrolled urbanisation, establishment of new factories &amp; industries
without proper planning, lack of strict policy and corruption in government
offices are so far the main reasons for increasing pollution in our country. I
wish this will stop and we will be conscious enough not to destroy our own
inhabitants.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a handcraft item which you made yourself.

**You should say:**

  * what it was
  * how you made it
  * what you did with it

**and explain how you felt about making it yourself. **

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer 1:**  
Kite flying is a popular activity in China and I have made different types of
kites in various occasions all by myself. For this cue card topic I would love
to talk about a dragon kite that I made when I was around 16 years old.  
  
Qingming Festival, also known as Tomb Sweeping Day, is a traditional and
widely celebrated festival in China and it is usually falls in April. During
this festival many people, especially children and young, play around with
variety of kites. On such an occasion I made a kite which was more than 4 feet
in length and looked like a red dragon. This sort of kite is usually called
dragon kite and it is quite tough to make and fly. When a traditional kite
might take an hour to be made, a dragon kite sometimes take more than a week,
depending on the size and shape of it.  
  
It took me more than 4 days to complete this kite and I required to purchase
some special papers, colour, plastic, glue, ribbon, and sticks to make this
kite. First I had to use the sticks of different sizes to build the main shape
of the kite. The sticks were linked to each other very strongly and I used
glue, sticks and plastic to make the final shape of the kite. Then I  checked
whether the structure was strong enough to fly or not. After that  I wrapped
the frame with colourful papers and plastics to give it a beautiful shape. I
was quite happy to see the final outcome and was convinced that it would fly
without any obstacle. The wings of the dragon were more than 1 feet each and I
had to be very careful while making it. Any wrong shape of the wing would
actually ruin the whole project. I had to make it strong while keeping it
light. That was a tough challenge but luckily I was quite successful in making
the final kite.  
  
When I made the kite and finally flew it in the sky, it was a great experience
for me. I was relieved that it was flying and looked good. People were looking
at that large size dragon kite and some of them appreciated it. It was
embracing the white cloud in the sky and went higher than most other kites. It
was moving as if a great dragon was acting as a guardian of the sky and
protecting the people below it. I was quite excited when it finally declared
its prominence in the sky.

**Cue Card Answer 2: **  
Oh my goodness! This topic is tough for me. I’m not really a ‘handcraft’ sort
of person. I am very bad at creative things, I really admire it when I see
what other people can do – somehow taking some old newspapers and a bucket of
glue and creating some extraordinary work of art out of papier mâché, but that
isn’t really me unfortunately. If I tried the same it would end up with spilt
glue and newspaper print smeared everywhere and a gooey heap of soggy paper
trailing all around the room! However, when I was very little we used to
sometimes do craft at school, and occasionally I’d see a children’s TV
programme which would include ideas of things that were easy to make with
discarded household items. I can think of an example of this, and that’s what
I’m going to talk about today. I’ll tell you what it was (though that might be
harder than you think), how I made it, what I did with it, and what I felt
about it too.  
  
Well, as to the ‘what it was’. I suppose I can only say it was a ‘useful box
for putting things in’, (which is a quote from Winnie the Pooh in case you
were wondering). Not that useful probably, because it was very small. It will
make more sense when I explain how I made it.  
  
So, what you needed was an old matchbox. Nowadays, matchboxes tend to be made
of cardboard, but when I was very little they were actually made of very
finely cut wood sometimes. I have no idea how that worked, but they were. All
I did, was take an old matchbox once the matches had all been used. Then I got
hold of some very special sellotape. It was gold, I really don’t know where it
came from, because it would be unusual even now. However, I had it, and some
silver tape too. I very carefully wound the gold and silver tape around the
outside of the matchbox until it was completely covered up. If you look at the
box now you can see it’s a bit wonky, so it must have been hard to do with my
little podgy fingers as a toddler. I then found a button from somewhere, and
stuck it on the middle of the top of the box. Job done. A little box for
secret treasure. So what did I do with it? Well, the purpose of this creative
outburst was to make a gift for my Dad. I’m not sure if I did this for
fathers’ day, or whether I made it for a birthday present, but it was very
definitely made with my dad in mind. So what I did with it, was wrap it up
carefully for him to open at breakfast on the morning of his special day.  
  
Honestly, I don’t remember now how I felt about making it myself, but I’m
guessing I would have been very proud, because I was at an age when I’d have
been too little to have any money of my own, and it took quite a bit of
initiative to come up with this gift idea and follow it through (though I have
a suspicion my mum might have helped a bit with gluing on the button!).
However, last year my Dad died, and over the subsequent months I’ve been
sorting through some of his things quite gradually. In a side drawer of his
desk I came across this little box which he had carefully kept for nearly 50
years. It had been put into service for storing potentially useful paper
clips, and was very suitable for such a job. It was really strange seeing it
again. On the one hand it was long forgotten, until that moment I had no idea
he still had it, let alone for current use. On the other hand as soon as I saw
it I recognised it instantly. It was quite poignant, but also a good memory. I
had done this spontaneous thing for him, and although essentially it was just
an old matchbox wrapped up in sellotape which had now largely lost its
stickiness and was peeling away that didn’t matter. It wasn’t the quality of
my handcraft that was important, it was the love and determination that had
gone in to making it.  
  
So it seems, even though my attempt at handcraft wouldn’t win any prizes in a
competition, I hope this little story goes to show that really and truly, it
is often the case that it really is ‘the thought that counts’! How do I feel
about making it myself? Well, really happy, it was such a personal exchange,
and I was happy that my Dad must have really appreciated it to have kept it
for all those years.

sample%2F2472-describe-a-problem-in-your-city&title=Cue%20Card%20Sample)

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a problem in your city/hometown.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * how serious it is
  * what causes this problem

**and say what can be done to solve/reduce this problem. **

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer 1:**  
I live in _(… say the name of your city...)_ and this city has a very large
population. With the increasing population, unplanned urbanisation, rapid
industrialisation and lack of proper steps from the authority have led to many
different problems here and traffic congestion, in my opinion, is the worst of
all.  
  
Traffic jam in large cities is a common problem; however this in our city is
far worse. It is a common scenario in our city that cars are stuck on roads
and passengers and drivers have to wait for unusually long time before they
can move forward. Sometimes cars and buses remain unmoved for more than an
hour and people get very depressed and annoyed due to this. The long lines of
cars and buses and their movement at a snail's pace have become a very
annoying yet common scenario in this city. The rush hours are even more
devastating and bad traffic kills a considerable amount of time each day. The
business owners, office goers, students and their parents and people from all
walks of life suffer seriously due to this uncontrollable traffic jam.
Everyone seems like devastated and vexed about it, authorities know that as
well, and yet there no proper steps to solve this heinous problem.  
  
There are many reasons behind this problem and increasing number of cars and
vehicles in my opinion is the main reason. The number of cars is increasing
more rapidly than the construction of new roads and roads are becoming more
congested. Second, lack of proper traffic control system and scarcity of
traffic police could be another reason for that. Moreover, the public
transportations are not as reliable and updated as they should have been and
due to that people are mostly relying on private cars in my city. Violation of
traffic rules is another main reason for this unbearable traffic jam.  
  
Some effective measures must be taken in order to address this serious
problem. Since this is already a grave issue, steps should be taken before it
gets worse. First, government and road authority should invest more money for
building new roads and for the repairing and maintaining of old ones,
particularly in areas where traffic jam is more severe. On the other hand,
public transportations should be improved so that people use them more
frequently. Restriction on private car ownership in our city is also required
for the control of increasing traffic jam. At the same time, it is essential
that stricter traffic rules be issues and violation of traffic regulation
should be severely punished in order to reduce the traffic jam.

**Cue Card Answer 2: **  
Oh no! I love the city I live in – Sheffield in the UK! It feels wrong to talk
about its problems when there is so much about the city that I’d like to
celebrate and share with you instead. However, if you really insist, I can
think of a problem in my city that certainly leaves me breathless with
frustration more often than I like to admit. I’ll try to explain what it is,
how serious it is, and the causes of the problem.  
  
So, don’t laugh, but the problem with my city of Sheffield is the hills!
Before I moved to Sheffield a few years ago now, I didn’t really know anything
about the city. Since I’ve come here I absolutely love it. The city is quite
compact, known as ‘greenest city in Europe’ because of the large number of
outdoor green spaces within the city boundaries, and is next to one of the
UK’s National Parks, The Peak District. I suppose the clue is in the name,
‘the peaks’. Sheffield is said to be built on seven hills – like Rome
apparently, though I’ve never been there so I don’t know how the two cities
compare. I do know, that when I first moved to Sheffield I could not believe
how steep, how long and how many hills there are! I am not talking about
gentle undulations, I am talking about proper steep hills, where you have to
wear walking shoes, dig deep, head down and haul yourself up the hills. I
thought I was reasonably fit, but soon discovered I was a ‘soft southerner’
(that’s a sort of affectionate derogatory phrase some people who live in the
colder, hillier north use to describe their compatriots who live nearer to
London in the south of the United Kingdom). I really puffed my way up those
hills, and would have to stop now and again to recover my breath, whereas my
friends who were born and bred in Sheffield had no problem in storming up
gradients that I thought impossibly steep.  
  
How serious is the problem? Well, it depends! It is genuinely a problem if you
are say elderly or disabled, it is physically challenging to get around. In
winter, when there is snow and ice often roads become completely impassable,
buses are cancelled and those that are able to walk to work have to do so –
sometimes clinging to sidewalls and lampposts along their route to avoid
sliding down hill all the way! When I first came to Sheffield I was worried my
car wouldn’t be able to cope with the steep hills, I’d never driven up
anything with such an incline before. Over time I’ve become a bit more
confident in my driving skills, by clutch control and the reliability of my
handbrake, but I still won’t venture out in the car at the first sign of ice.
In the UK, it is quite common for people to have driveways outside their
houses where they can pull up and park their cars on dedicated off street
parking. Sheffield is no different, but what is different is the angles of
those driveways. Local people will think nothing of parking their car on a 45
degree slope that would terrify me. I always thought only a four by four
vehicle would be safe negotiating such terrain, here the consensus is
otherwise!  
  
However, even problems can have unexpected positives associated with them!
Walking round Sheffield certainly keeps you fit. I might still puff going up
some of the steeper hills, but I can now get up them without stopping. I now
take it for granted that everywhere is hilly round me, and although I still
can’t work out how it is possible for a route to and from the town centre to
apparently be uphill both going out and coming back, I do take it in my
stride. I now forget how hilly it is. A few months ago I took part in a half-
marathon running race in my home city. The organisers had warned participants
that there was a really steep hill section. In fact it was 6 miles
continuously up hill, and then about another 7 miles return undulating back to
the start. As we set off, quite soon some runners around me were saying ‘this
must be the really steep hill the organisers warned us about’ I was
astonished! We were still on a part of the course that in Sheffield terms was
flat. The ‘proper’ hill was a long way off, if they thought the route was
challenging already, well, oh my, they were in for a shock later on! As a
local, I wasn’t necessarily any faster going up those hills, but
psychologically at least they didn’t take me by surprise!  
  
What is the cause! Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, local geography!
There’s not much to be done about that. So when it comes to saying what might
be done to ‘solve the problem’ I think it isn’t about ‘solving’ it at all.
Rather it is more of an ‘if you can’t beat them, join them’ sort of situation.
By which I mean, instead of fretting over what can’t be changed, it’s much
better to accept it, and even learn to appreciate it! After all, hard as those
hills are to climb, one of the very best things about Sheffield is getting up
as high as you can on the edge of the city. Way, way up where the open moors
of the Peak District meet the city boundary you get amazing views. In one
direction you can see back across the city, and pick out landmarks in amongst
the hills. In the other you can see heather and moor or woodland depending on
which way you choose to look. So the hills are a problem, sometimes, but they
are also what gives the city its unique character as well as help me in my
literal and metaphorical battle to keep fit! Besides, after all that walking
in the open air I think I’ve earned the right for a restorative cup of strong
Yorkshire Tea and a slice of cake! So, the hills might be a short term
problem, but they are certainly a long term gain!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a person whose job is important to the society.

**You should say:**

  * who this person is
  * what is his/her profession
  * how s/he helps others

**and explain why the job this person has is important to the society. **

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer:**  
Every honest job is noble in my opinion if it somehow helps others. While
police officers risk their lives to protect the people and ensure the law and
order, lawyers defend the innocents or prove a criminal guilty. Likewise,
politicians devote their time and life for the greater good of the country,
doctors heal our illness, scientists and researchers put our civilisation one
step forward and this list goes on and on. However, for this cue card topic I
would like to talk about a person who is a teacher and in my opinion, her job
is quite important to the society as well as to the country.  
  
The name of this teacher is Mary Margaret and she is an English teacher in a
high school located in our area. She is in fact, a much revered teacher among
her students and colleagues and I like the invaluable contribution she has for
teaching in an excellent way. Besides, she is an honest person with many other
excellent qualities that make her an exemplary person in our society.  
  
Teaching, in my opinion, is a very noble profession and makes the society a
better place by eradicating our ignorance and by creating an enlightened
generation. This profoundly important job is done by teachers who are doing a
really great job for all of us. In this present era, formal educational
institutes help us to enhance our knowledge and prepare us for the future.
Creating an illuminated society is the main purpose of the education and
teachers are helping us to acquire the wisdom and knowledge we need to lead a
better life. This is why I personally think that a teacher's job is one of the
most important jobs in our society.  
  
Speaking of Mary Margaret, I was one of her favourite students and her
teaching style was quite unique. Her excellent teaching style helped me learn
many grammatical rules and use English more fluently. As a teacher, she was
quite devoted and punctual. She must be very proud that some of her students
are in important positions nationwide and some of them still visit her.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a trip which was not up to your expectations.

**You should say:**

  * where you went
  * what you did
  * what happened

**and explain why the trip was not up to your expectations.**

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer:**  
Right, I’m racking my brain to think of a good example for this one. Often
when I set out on a trip or mini-adventure, I try to keep an open mind, to be
flexible and make the most of whatever experience presents itself. I think if
you embark on things with very fixed expectations that can end in
disappointment. Then again, sometimes it’s pretty clear that you have a
reasonable expectation that, for example, a bus will take you from one place
to a particular end destination, or your outing to collect a purchase from a
certain shop will pass largely unremarkably. So a trip doesn’t have to be
anything especially adventurous, just in this instance something which didn’t
pass in the way I’d expected it to… Hmm, hang on, I’ve got one, I think it’s a
good example, perhaps even a comical one too – I wonder what you will make of
it. I’ll tell you where I went, what I did, what happened, and why the trip
was not AT ALL what was expected…

Some years ago I celebrated my fortieth birthday by booking an exotic holiday.
I saved up for a very long time so that I could afford to go, and it was
certainly special. I was to spend some time in Tanzania on safari, and then
immediately afterwards travel on to the Island of Zanzibar for a two day
extension on the beaches there. The holiday itself was absolutely amazing, and
when I got to Zanzibar I couldn’t believe how lovely it was. Beautiful
beaches, friendly and welcoming people, and extraordinary architecture. The
city seemed to me to be out of a fairy tale. A labyrinth of passageways with
tall ancient walls and enormous Morocco style solid wooden doors towering over
the narrow streets, which were heaving with local people going about their
daily business. Now, the first thing that happened in Zanzibar, was that I
heard from my travel agent, that there was a problem with my return flight
back to the UK. They were very sorry, but I’d have to stay on for three extra
days – at their expense of course – in a luxury hotel! I couldn’t believe it!
This wasn’t a hardship at all, I felt as if I was in paradise, and the hotel
suite I was staying in was bigger than my own flat at home, this was really no
inconvenience at all, I felt as if I’d won the lottery! However, this is not
the unexpected trip I want to tell you about, although it I the cause of my
embarking on it. Finding myself with some extra days to fill in an unknown
location, I met up with some other travellers in the same situation and we
planned what we could do together. One of them had read about a really amazing
restaurant in the city and suggested we all go there together. The problem was
that gorgeous as Zanzibar undoubtedly was, it’s main centre really isn’t a
city to explore at night. The winding maze of lanes with its mix of Swahili
and Islamic influences were beautiful certainly, but also nigh on impossible
to navigate. The streets were unlit, and although most people were law abiding
as naïve comparatively wealthy tourists we were warned we would be at risk of
pickpocket or worse if we ventured out unaccompanied. However, there was an
easy solution. The hotel said that if we just stepped outside, there would
always be some enterprising local person who for a dollar between us, would
take us safely to wherever we wanted to go. By employing them, we would be
safe from other touts or pickpockets, and could easily walk to where we wanted
to go, plus contribute a bit of money to the local community. This sounded
like a good plan and we all agreed on this trip to the favoured restaurant.

From memory, I think there were about half a dozen of us. We stepped outside
our hotel, and just as we had been advised a potential guide approached us,
and agreed to take us where we wanted to go for just a dollar. We handed over
our fee, and he set off – at quite a pace. We jogged behind him through the
dark maze of narrow lanes. It was exciting being out at night, the main town –
called Stone Town with good reason – was even more spectacular and spooky at
night. We marvelled at how our guide was able to take us down hidden rat-runs
on seemingly un-navigable short cuts. At one point one of our number lost his
nerve. He became convinced that this man was trying to lure us to a secret
location where we would all be mugged and robbed away from spying eyes, but
the rest of us laughed at his ridiculous caution! After some half an hour or
so, our guide announced we were at the restaurant, because we had already paid
him, he then vanished into the dark. After a few seconds we realised it wasn’t
where we had wanted to go at all! It was a completely different restaurant,
perhaps one where he got a commission for bringing tourists. Nevertheless, it
looked very good, and laughingly we decided to eat there anyway. The food was
absolutely excellent, and with the exception of our more cautious fellow
traveller who feared treachery at every turn and was indignant that we’d been
tricked in this way, the rest of us found it hilarious. After all, we’d
enjoyed our night tour of the streets of Zanzibar, and there was no way on
earth we’d have had the courage to do that on our own. In any case we had a
delicious meal so where was the harm.

After our meal, it slowly dawned on us that we now had to find our way back to
the hotel, and we had absolutely no idea where we were. This wasn’t looking so
good. We paid our bill, and managed to ask at the restaurant for directions
‘home’. We showed him the card with our hotel’s details on it. The
restauranteur looked really confused. At first we thought he just didn’t
understand what we were asking, but eventually, he took us to the door,
pointed down the road, and there was our hotel. It was within sight, we were
perhaps 300 metres away from where we started off. Our guide it seemed had
taken us round in a big circle, ending up almost back where we started!

So to summarise, the trip was a guided excursion to a restaurant, so that is
where we went. What did I do? Employ a guide to take me and some others to a
recommended eating place. What happened? Well, we had a magical mystery tour
that ended up somewhere else entirely. The trip didn’t meet my expectations
because strictly speaking we didn’t end up where we were supposed to, not even
close! However, it honestly didn’t matter. I really enjoyed my tour through
the pitch black maze of streets in Zanzibar, I still had a delicious meal with
new friends, and for just a dollar that adventure was worth every penny! All’s
well that ends well after all, and it was a great mini-adventure.

It just shows that things might not always work out quite as planned or as
expected, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that things end in disaster. Far
from it, I think I get more pleasure from this traveller’s tale than I would
if everything had gone exactly as expected from the outset!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a family not your own that you like.

**You should say:**

  * whose family it is
  * how many family members they have
  * what are they like

**and explain why you like this family.**

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer:**  
Umm... that's an interesting topic, I would say. There are many families I
know about and I am very close with some of these families, but I have never
thought that I would have to describe such a family. Well, I think describing
Emma and her family would be more convenient and natural for me as she is one
of my best friends and I know her family very closely.  
  
Emma has a family with 5 members- her parents, she, Jonathan who is 11 and
Emma's sister Paula, who is a doctor. They live only 5 blocks away from our
house and as a friend, I know Emma for more than 15 years. They moved here
some 16 years ago and they often visit our house, I would say at least once in
a week. Emma is a talented girl with an excellent academic record. The reason
she is a very good friend of mine is because of her tender nature and friendly
attitude. The first time I met her, I found her very sociable, easygoing,
gregarious and cordial. Since then we two are close friends.  
  
Her father, Mr Alex is an architect and would be around 48 years old. He is
working in a large private company and stay out of the town most of the time.
When he is not working, he remains busy in his garden. He is quite a devoted
gardener and I must state that he has got the finest garden in our block. He
does not speak much but I had few conversations with him and I found him quite
intelligent and he has a sense of humour that makes him more friendly than he
appears to be.  
  
Emma's mother is a school teacher and she teaches English literature in grade
7. She is a beautiful woman who loves every living soul. She is also a great
cook. She has a natural talent of cooking a variety of food items and this
makes her very famous among our friends. Some dishes she made for us was
completely unknown to us and she brought the opportunity for us to taste those
for the first time in my life. Her father was a photographer and she travelled
a lot in her early age in different parts of the world including Asia, Africa
and Europe. She is more like her eldest daughter Paula than Emma.  
  
I guess Emma is a fine mixture of both of her parents and that makes her an
excellent person. She is my friend for a long and we two have a very close
relationship as friends. I find her very curious and her amiable behaviour and
polite way of speaking make her very cordial and affectionate.

Paula, Emma’s sister’ is a doctor and she is married to a doctor as well. She
had two children who are both in their elementary schools. As Paula lives with
her husband, I have met her only twice and know very little about her. She is
beautiful and blunter than Emma.  
  
Finally, Jonathan, the youngest member of the family, is in grade 5 and he is
full of new ideas and joy. He always smiles, plays and talks and has a good
relationship with me. I like him very much due to his frankness and his
respect for anyone who is senior to him. As he stated he wants to become a
great detective like Sherlock holmes someday.  
  
This is a good family that anyone would expect as his neighbour. We often
visit Emma's family and have family parties. Our family members have a close
and friendly relationship with Emma's family and surprisingly Emma's father
talks a lot when he is with my father. Probably they love to discuss things
together and have common interests and topics to talk about.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a product you bought and felt happy.

**You should say:**

  * what it was
  * why you bought it
  * how long you used it

**and explain why you were happy buying this product. **

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one

**Sample Answer:**  
This is an interesting topic for me and I thank you for the chance to talk
about an item that I purchased and was happy about. Well, I can remember many
such experiences, however, after I bought a washing machine for my mother, I
was exhilarated.  
  
My mother is a housewife and she does a lot for all of us. She is like the
comfortable shadow in our life on a hot summer day. We quite often forget to
tell her how much we love her and sometimes we do not even thank her for
things she does. But without her, our life would simply be a disaster. After I
started my job, I had a plan to buy her something. I saved some money each
month and then after few months I decided to buy her a washing machine so that
she no longer needs to do her laundry manually. I thought that would save her
from some tedious weekly works and would allow her to enjoy more leisure
hours.  
  
One day I went to a large LG showroom and selected a medium size washing
machine. It was bit expensive for me to afford at that time but I bought it
anyway. After I reached home with this washing machine and surprised everybody
with this sudden commodity, I realised how exhilarating it is to be able to
make others happy. My mother was very excited that I astounded her in such a
way. She asked me to teach her how to operate it and then cooked some special
dishes at night to make the event memorable. This was probably something she
wished to own and when I bought it for her, she was very amazed... She was
also worried that I had to spend a large sum of money to buy it, but I told
her that it is something I always planned to do with my salary.  
  
After that, I have bought many products and electronic gadgets for me or for
others, but being able to surprise my mother with my first earned salary was
something very special. The washing machine I bought worked fine for more than
5 years and it was then replaced with a newer one. However, my memory
regarding this first washing machine at our home was something I will never
forget.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a special trip you would like to go on in the future.

**You should say:**

  * when possibly it will be
  * where would you go
  * what preparation do you need for that trip

**and explain why this would be a special trip. **

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer 1:**  
I love to travel and being in a new place is quite a sensational experience
for me. I have visited more than 10 countries and most of the famous places in
my homeland. However, most of my trips were either solo or with friends. A few
months ago I planned a very special trip that I would like to go on in the
near future. I want to visit _(... a sea beach name in your country...)_ and
take my parents in this very special trip. The main reason this would be a
special trip is because my parents would be with me and this would be the
first time they will visit the largest sea beach in our country. Having my
parents with me there would make it special. It's been more than 7 years when
we had our last trip together.  
  
Probably we will have this special trip in the next January. I will take few
days off from my office and would prepare for the trip. This would be 6-8
hours journey and we would prefer to travel by train rather than bus. My
parents are also very excited about the journey and they are also looking
forward to going to this trip.  
  
We do not need much preparation for this trip as this would a short trip and
we would be staying for only 4-5 days, I guess. We would only need to be
concerned about the weather condition and pick clothes that are suitable for
the summer season. We will start this trip from the city train station and our
preference would be to book a first class compartment of the train. The train
journey is usually pleasant in our country and we will have the chance to
enjoy the scenic beauty on the both side of our route.  
  
After we arrive the destination, we will first reserve a nice hotel for us
that will have the view of the sea beach. If we take the train at around 6:00
in the morning, we will reach there just before 2:00 pm, I assume. We will
have our lunch and take rest for a couple of hours. In the afternoon we will
go and enjoy the sea beach and stay for a couple of hours there. We will also
enjoy the sea-foods from a renowned restaurant and get back to our hotel at
night. During this trip, we will visit two other nearby famous tourists
destinations and enjoy our stay there. We will buy some gifts for other family
members and relatives and enjoy the whole trip.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe someone older than you whom you admire.

**You should say:**

  * who this person is
  * what s/he does
  * what he is like

**and explain why you admire this person so much. **

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer 1:**  
This is an interesting topic and I thank you for the opportunity to talk about
someone older than me whom I admire. This would be without any doubt my
brother, John, who is five years senior to me. He is my idol, a person I
admire from the bottom of my heart and a great friend of mine.

John is an architect and he has been working in a large design and development
company for more than 3 years. His academic records are excellent and he is
planning to move to Canada next year to further enhance his career. I have got
only one brother and that is John.

He will be 30 in this coming November and has shown a great promise throughout
his academic life. My parents and John's teachers have always been optimistic
about his becoming a great person in life. I am proud of being his younger
brother. Last year John had been a team member of a historically important
monument design in our country and a news article described all about the
project and people behind this. When I saw John's picture in the newspaper, I
was quite happy and excited. He is quite handsome and has got the looking of
my mother. He is fond of different outdoor sports  and I often play football
and volleyball with him.

John has always been there for me. In my early childhood he was my best buddy
and other children knew that John would always protect me no matter what. In
several occasions John fought for me and I was happy for having such a great
brother in my life. Furthermore, he has always been a great mentor and adviser
for me. He helped me completing my homeworks, taught me how to play different
indoor and outdoor games and always treated me very kindly. He is a good
mannered and a punctual person and he has tried to instill so many moralities
and good habits in me that only a good mentor would do.

My parents were both busy in their professional life and yet they tried to
spend their time with us whenever possible. Despite that, I often missed them
and it was John who supported me all the time. Without him my life would have
been much difficult and full of loneliness.

I like and admire him for his well-manner, respect for others, great talent
and the unparalleled support he has in my life. I consider him a great person
who would help thousand others through his words and works and having a
brother like him is indeed a matter of great pride.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a party that you enjoyed.

**You should say:**

  * what it was about
  * where the party was held
  * what people did during the party

**and explain what you enjoyed about this party.**

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer:**  
Ooh parties!  That conjures up so many different possibilities.  Children’s
parties with jelly and ice cream and silly games like ‘pin the tail on the
donkey’ when I was little, or more ‘serious’ celebratory reception parties
after a wedding.  However, the most recent party I went to was neither of
those things, and it was great!  
  
I’m going to tell you what it was about; where it was held; what people did
during the party (which might be a bit unexpected) and explain what it was
that I enjoyed about this party in particular.  
  
So, the occasion was a birthday, but not for a person, for an event.  In the
UK – and indeed in many other countries world-wide now, there is an
organisation called parkrun.  This umbrella group sets up free, inclusive
running events all over the country.   I think at last count there were 406 of
these runs taking place every Saturday at 9.00 a.m. at different locations
throughout the UK.  Parkrun organise free, weekly, 5km timed runs. They are
open to everyone, free, and are safe and easy to take part in.  The initiative
first started about 10 years ago, with just one run, now it has expanded and
new runs start up all the time.  It has become something of a tradition that
every community run celebrates their ‘birthday’ on the anniversary of the date
on which they were first established.  It is a good excuse for an annual prize
giving, conversation and lots of cake!  This particular party was at a parkrun
that is reasonably local to me, although not my ‘home’ parkrun, but I made a
special trip to their event to join in their celebrations.  
  
The ‘party’ was held at a place called Graves Park in Sheffield.  It is a
lovely public open space, which also has a small animal park, so part of the
5km run takes you past an eclectic mix of animals including highland cows;
alpaca; donkeys; pigs and a couple of curious goats.  Everyone assembled in
time for the usual Saturday 9.00 a.m. start to take part in the run, but
because it was the Graves parkrun’s fourth birthday everything was a bit
different from normal...  
  
So in terms of what people did at the party?  Well, we all ran 5 km for a
start.  That’s not what usually happens at a birthday party, but it is what
always happens at a parkrun.  In other ways though, the event was a bit more
unexpected.  The main change was that the course was run in reverse.  This was
quite comical, as it is confusing running in the ‘wrong’ direction, and meant
some of the steep uphill climbs on the usual route were replaces with death
–defying downhill scrambles!  It’s a bit like trying to cross your arms the
wrong way round, you’d think it would be easy or at least ‘no different’ from
how you usually do it - until you actually try.  Go on, have a go, you’ll soon
see what I mean!  The next difference, was that lots of us were in fancy
dress!  I’ll wear fancy dress at any excuse.  I have a child’s toy wrap-around
pony costume.  It looks great, like I’m riding a miniature pony, but is in
fact incredibly light and easy to run in.  Other people wore onesies (all in
one jump suits made to look like animals).  A few men wore drag (dressed in
women’s clothes) some more imaginative runners came dressed up as Roman
soldiers (complete with helmets and large circular shields) or various cloaked
super heroes (Batman and Robin and Wonder Woman just for starters).  It was
great fun, we must have been quite a sight, some 250 runners or so storming
round in ridiculous outfits.  At the end of the run, lots of people had
brought sweets or cake with them to share as part of the birthday
celebrations.  We all adjourned to a convenient café within the park for a
good humoured prize giving.  Lots of awards were handed out, not just for
running fast but for humorous things too.  Champion volunteer; fastest canine
(there is a whippet that regularly takes park, and sometimes its owner’s even
auction the opportunity to run with the dog as it will drag the runners round
and give them a chance of getting a really fast time!)  I clapped in
recognition as the prizes were awarded, but, most exciting of all, there was
one extra prize.  For ‘Best Fancy Dress Costume', I won!  My pony is called
Roger, and we collected our prize of a big box of sweets together.  I am not
very athletic, so I’d never win any sports prize for actually running, but I
was so delighted to win a prize within the parkrun community I thought I’d
burst!  After the prizes had been given out, we all stayed in the café,
chatting, admiring each other’s costumes and most importantly of all drinking
tea and eating cake.  Someone had even made a special parkrun cake with the
parkrun logo on it.  It was a great party indeed!  
  
Why did I particularly enjoy it?  Well, I think it must be obvious surely.  I
got to spend my Saturday morning doing my favourite thing, which is taking
part in parkrun, with a fantastic group of people, followed by tea and cake.
What’s more, I got an excuse to wear party dress, have a good old giggle with
friends AND I won a prize. What’s not to like.  Parkrun is great and parkrun
event birthday parties?  Well they are better still!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a piece of electronic equipment that you find useful.

**You should say:**

  * what it is
  * how you learned to use it
  * how long you have had it

**and explain why you find this piece of electronic equipment useful.**

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer:**  
This is an interesting topic. My immediate thought is that I don’t use all
that much electronic equipment – I don’t even have a smart phone. I do use a
lot of rather common place technology; phone; laptop; ‘white goods’ like
refrigerators and washing machines, but I think they’d be quite boring to talk
about. I mean, there isn’t much I could say about learning how to use a fridge
is there? Not to worry, I can think of something I find really useful and only
acquired very recently. It has been a learning curve, but it is so worth it.
I’ll tell you what it is, how I’ve learned to use it, how long I’ve had it and
how come I find it so useful.  
  
The piece of equipment is a GPS (global positioning satellite) watch. It’s
called a tomtom runner, and basically, if I wear it whilst out running it
tracks various bits of information. It will tell me how long I’ve run for,
what pace, what distance, the elevation and other useful things. It can buzz
on my wrist after every mile for example which is either motivating or
dispiriting depending on how well my run is going! When I get back home after
my run, I simply connect the watch to my laptop, and through some magic of
technology it uploads my run onto a software programme called Strava. This
means I can see a map of where I’ve run, compare that day’s run with previous
attempts at that route, and even see who else has done the same run if they
use Strava too. It even tells me how many calories I’ve burned doing that run
– never as many as I’d like if I’m honest!  
  
How did I learn to use it? Hmm, shall I be honest. I cheated a bit. I’m
something of a late adopter with technology, I find it frustrating learning to
use new equipment, and given that I’d been managing perfectly well without a
fancy GPS running watch ever since I’d started running a couple of years ago I
couldn’t see the benefits of putting myself through all that angst or working
out how to use it properly. However, all of that changed in January this year.
My running club had organised a three month winter challenge, we were put in
teams and had to commit to do so many runs each week of a certain distance. To
take part, I’d need a GPS watch. Points were given for distance, elevation and
number of runs, with bonus points for running in sub-zero conditions or very
early in the morning. The idea was to encourage us all to keep on running
through the dark and dismal British winter. Rather reluctantly, I went to my
local running shop. They were BRILLIANT. They recommended a ‘cheap and
cheerful’ starter watch, and set it all up for me. They charged it, connected
it up to my laptop (which I took in with me); downloaded all the software. All
I had to do at first was push a button to start the watch when I set out, and
push the same button again to stop! After my run I just connected it to my
laptop and as if by magic everything updated. To begin with this was enough,
but after a few weeks I started to play around with other buttons on the watch
and discovered it can do more fancy things! I am still learning how to use it
properly, and it is rather trial and error, but now I can see the benefits of
this nifty bit of kit I’m much more motivated to invest time in working out
its finer features! I’ve now had the watch for just about 6 months.  
  
Why do I find this GPS watch useful? Well, it’s been really unexpected, but I
love that I now have a record of all my runs. Even if I feel I’ve had a bad
day running, being able to see the overall distance I’ve covered, or the
elevation builds my confidence. I was surprised at how many miles I actually
cover each week. True, they are slow miles, but they add up all the same. It
also has made running much more fun. I can see if friends have done the same
run as me, and there is even a feature on Strava that allows me to identify
other runners I passen route, so you can see how your runs compare with
theirs. There are some fun things too. There is a trend towards something
called Strava Art. Basically that means you deliberately try and run to create
the outline of a picture with your route. During our winter challenge we had
to try and ‘draw’ a rabbit, with our run route (for Easter) and a heart shape
(for Valentine’s Day). It was had planning it out, and plodding round the
paths I was really unsure if it would actually work. Would the satellite pick
me up? Would the route really turn out as expected once it was uploaded? It
was incredibly rewarding when they did, but even when they didn’t that was
really entertaining. Because everyone in the running club was doing the same
challenge I really forward to seeing their shapes too.  
  
What I’m trying to say, is that this unexpected bit of technology has really
revolutionised my running. It enables me to track progress, it tells you if
you’ve achieved a ‘Personal Best’ time on a particular segment, and it makes
running much more social. It has also made me a bit more accountable to
others. I can see what my friends are doing – but they can see what I’m up to
as well. It makes me want to try harder so I’m not caught out slacking. Seven
months ago, before I got my GPS watch I really didn’t understand why anyone
would want one. Now, I feel bereft if I run without it. It feel like ‘if I
can’t upload it on Strava afterwards, my run didn’t really happen!’ I know
rationally, that is a stupid attitude, but honestly it’s true. I think if you
asked most runners, or cyclists who use this bit of electronic equipment they
would sheepishly admit to the same thing. It seems it is quite true, you can’t
miss what you never had. I never gave a moment’s thought to how useful a GPS
watch might be until I was nudged into it by my running club, but now I find
it hard to imagine how any runner could function without one! What a
difference a few months makes eh?  
  
I’m still not ready for a smart phone though… one day perhaps!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a friend of your family you remember from your childhood.

**You should say:**

  * who this person was
  * how you &amp; your family knew this person
  * how often this person visited your house

**and explain why you remember this person.**

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer:**  
Hmm, an interesting question.  When I was growing up various friends of the
family came and went, local shop-keepers were friendly but perhaps not truly
‘friends’ in the real sense of the word; neighbours were good fun but then
moved away.  The person I can think was around throughout my childhood, albeit
intermittently.  I’m going to try and explain to you who this person was as
well as how it was we came to know them. The question about how often they
visited our house is a bit tricky, but doesn’t make them less of a friend, and
finally I’ll explain why it is this person made such a strong impression on me
I remember them still.

When I was growing up, I lived in a fairly suburban area.  Once a year, for
two weeks of the summer holidays, we’d all pile into the family car and drive
for what seemed to me like an eternity to the English countryside of the far
north – Northumberland.  We always stayed in the same holiday cottage which
was self-catering.  It was on a mixed sheep/ cattle and arable farm, and our
cottage was attached to the shepherd’s permanent home.  He lived there with
his wife and kept chickens at the end of his garden.  The person who I want to
tell you about is the shepherd.  His name was Ronnie Shipley and to me as a
child he was a magical figure.

Because we holidayed there every year throughout my childhood, he got to know
me and my whole family really well.  His own children had long ago grown up
and left home, and I think he liked having enthusiastic youngsters around who
idolised him and were interested in his work.  He would take us with him to
feed the hens, show us where we could find the secretive diamond-backed adders
in his garden.  These are beautiful snakes, and the only venomous ones in the
UK, but they are incredibly timid and difficult to spot.  He would let us
‘help’ with the sheep, (I don’t think we were very helpful at all) but we
swung on gates and cheerfully ran around herding them.  He had a sheepdog that
actually did all the work, but when I was very little I was none the wiser.
When we were older he plonked us on to the back of the old farm pony and let
us ride around the farm.  On one memorable occasion he even sat me on the back
of a wonderfully tame but enormous Hereford bull. They are actually incredibly
docile cattle, but I was still very impressed that I was able to do this.

Because he lived in Northumberland, and we lived down in the south of England
just outside London hundreds of miles away, in fact he never did visit our
house.  That seems a shame now I look back, but he loved his home in the
north, and couldn’t see the point in visiting anywhere else.  Also, I now
realise that he was actually pretty old even then, way past usual retirement
years, but carrying on doing the job he loved for as long as he could.  I
think a long journey by train would have been quite difficult for him.

As to why I remember this person, well he was such a wonderful magical figure
from my childhood.  It was as if he inhabited a parallel universe.  He taught
me to appreciate the countryside and the great outdoors.  He was patient and
kind with his time.  I remember him pointing out stars in the night sky –
things that I could never see at home because of the light pollution from the
urban area I lived in.  He also looked very distinctive.  He had a weather-
beaten wrinkled face from working outdoors year round for decades.  He wore a
flat cap and an old weathered tweed jacket, and always carried a shepherds
stick with him (which he’d made himself) and was accompanied by a collie dog
to help him in his work.  He must have taken a bit of a shine to our family,
as he always welcomed us with warmth and genuine affection. We’d pop round for
endless tea and coffee and shriek delightedly at the discoveries he revealed.
In return, sometimes he’d come with us when we went off on a family outing to
the seaside or some special place, trips out both he and his wife Annie much
enjoyed.

Now I’m long grown up and those holidays are a distant memory. Ronnie himself
died years ago. However, I still have two sticks which he made just for me.
One is a thumb stick – a very distinctive walking stick that you cut to the
right length according to your own height and then walk with your thumb
resting in the crook of a V formed where the stick has naturally divided.
Mine was specially picked out by him for me. The other is a more traditional
British shepherd’s crook.  It is a hazel stick, with a sheep’s horn on the
end.  On the horn he has carved my initials ‘L.M.’ together with the date
1978, so I know that I was 13 years old when he gave it to me.  What a special
treasure that is.

It’s funny, I was incredibly fond of Mr Shipley as I was growing up, but I
took his attention and generosity a bit for granted, I think that’s easy to do
when you are small. Now I’m older and wiser (hopefully) I think he is even
more remarkable.  We were just one of many families he must have met over the
years and yet he always made us feel special.  He was a remarkable man, and a
great friend to all our family.  I feel really blessed to have met him, and
his legacy endures in very real ways.  There is even a gooseberry bush in the
garden of my parent’s house that is from a cutting he gave to them decades
ago.  I wonder if he had any idea how special he was, and how much his
friendship meant to us all.  I think above all else he gave us his time, and
shared his stories, for me that was the best gift ever, as with it he
stimulated my imagination and gave me happy memories, those can endure almost
for ever!

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a photo of yourself you have taken.

**You should say:**

  * when you took it
  * what type of camera you used
  * why you took the photo

**and explain whether you like this photo or not. **

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer:**  
Well, these days such photographs are called 'selfie' and I did not know that
there was something called selfie until I turned to 23! Selfie is indeed a
craze these days while it was unheard of in the past, at least to me. The
photograph that I would like to talk about was not a so-called selfie that
teenagers take these days using the front camera of their mobile phones. I
took this picture many years ago when I was around 12 years old with a large
Canon camera.

My father gave me this camera on my 12th birthday and this was the first time
when I owned a camera. I loved to capture pictures of my relatives and
beautiful sceneries. We had to use a rolled film at that time called
‘rollfilm’ and did not have the freedom to take as many photos as we wanted
unlike the digital camera owners have these days.  
  
One day I was invited to one of my friends' birthday party and his parents
requested me to bring my camera with me. I took many photos at that party and
at night when I returned from the party, I noticed that 2-3 film strips were
still empty and I could take more photos before I send the film roll to be
washed and printed. At that time I was in my room and could not find anything
suitable to capture. I was standing in front of the looking glass and the idea
of taking my own picture popped in my head. It was a Canon CF-23 model camera
and had only 3-4 options to adjust the light and flash while taking a photo. I
had to spend more than 5 minutes to capture the picture and after I saw the
printed version of this photo, I loved it.  
  
The picture shows me standing straight and holding a camera in front of my
eyes. The backlight was visible and was more like a shining star in the sky. A
part of the room was visible but everything in the opposite direction as it
was through the mirror. I like this photo very much. It was taken by me, the
idea was new, at least to me and the photo looks nice. My mother has this
picture in her picture album and every time I see this photo, it reminds me my
teenage days.

**IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.**

##  Describe a piece of local news that was interesting to you.

**You should say:**

  * what it was about
  * when you heard/ read about it
  * what the story was

**and explain why it was interesting to you. **

[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one
minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to
help you if you wish.]

**Sample Answer:**  
Ahh! an interesting topic indeed. For this cue card topic, I would like to
talk about a piece of interesting and captivating local news that I read in a
newspaper. It would be more than 5 years ago, I assume, when I read this news
in a local newspaper called (...say a newspaper name common in your country…).  
  
In a fine morning, I opened the newspaper, like any other usual day, and found
a news story that caught my eyes. It was about a giant animal that people had
seen in the streets after midnight and many of them believed that it was a
ghost and could change its shape. The story even included some local people's
interviews who told the reporter that they saw this mysterious animal and
shape-shifter with their own eyes. The length of the news and its coverage
with pictures were evident that it was getting some attention, at least to
local people who like to gossip and believe strange stories. The reporter also
gave a hint that some recent crimes that the policemen were still struggling
to solve might have been connected with this unknown animal!  
  
I am not a person who can be easily convinced with such baseless stories.
However, I must give the reporter some credit to be able to present the news
very interestingly. The report did not mention a single time that such ghost
story is mostly fabricated and exaggerated. Rather it tried to convince the
readers that there are some solid ground of this news and people should be
careful at night. However, the reporter also reported his doubt about the
authenticity of people's opinion. Clever indeed, to attract both type of
readers - believers and non-believer of ghosts!  
  
The report also included that some people have informed the nearby police
station that a child was missing and they saw a giant beast around the house
of this child. However, the reporter cleverly avoided the fact that it was
some hearsay, not confirmed by the police. The story that I read ended with
mystery and uncertainty. I would say it was quite engaging and this was mostly
because how it was presented to the readers rather than the facts of the
story.  
  
Before I end, I would like to tell you about the findings of this ghost story
that was published at least 3 weeks later. The giant animal was a big panther
who was sick and fled from a nearby zoo. The authority caught it in a week.
The missing child was found after 2 days and this was a common missing-child
case. Finally, the people who fabricated the story somehow got busy with other
such cock-and-bull stories.
